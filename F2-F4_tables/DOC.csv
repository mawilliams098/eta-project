100,1,1,"Jove sends a lying dream to Agamemnon, who thereon calls the"
100,1,2,"chiefs in assembly, and proposes to sound the mind of his army — In"
100,1,3,the end they march to fight — Catalogue of the Achaean and Trojan
100,1,4,forces.
100,1,5,Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept
100,1,6,"soundly, but Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do"
100,1,7,"honour to Achilles, and destroyed much people at the ships of the"
100,1,8,Achaeans. In the end he deemed it would be best to send a lying
100,1,9,"dream to King Agamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it,"
100,1,10,"“Lying Dream, go to the ships of the Achaeans, into the tent of"
100,1,11,"Agamemnon, and say to him word for word as I now bid you. Tell"
100,1,12,"him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take"
100,1,13,Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno
100,1,14,"has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans.”"
100,1,15,"The dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached"
100,1,16,the ships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and
100,1,17,"found him in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered"
100,1,18,"over his head in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom"
100,1,19,"Agamemnon honoured above all his councillors, and said: —"
100,1,20,"“You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his"
100,1,21,host and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his
100,1,22,"sleep. Hear me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who,"
100,1,23,"though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you."
100,1,24,"He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall"
100,1,25,take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods;
100,1,26,"Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the"
100,1,27,"Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this, and when you wake"
100,1,28,see that it does not escape you.”
100,1,29,"The dream then left him, and he thought of things that were"
100,1,30,surely not to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day
100,1,31,"he was to take the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in"
100,1,32,"the mind of Jove, who had many another hard - fought fight in store"
100,1,33,"alike for Danaans and Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the"
100,1,34,"divine message still ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and"
100,1,35,"put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy"
100,1,36,"cloak. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and slung his"
100,1,37,silver - studded sword about his shoulders; then he took the
100,1,38,"imperishable staff of his father, and sallied forth to the ships"
100,1,39,of the Achaeans.
100,1,40,The goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she
100,1,41,"might herald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and"
100,1,42,Agamemnon sent the criers round to call the people in assembly;
100,1,43,so they called them and the people gathered thereon. But first he
100,1,44,summoned a meeting of the elders at the ship of Nestor king of
100,1,45,"Pylos, and when they were assembled he laid a cunning counsel"
100,1,46,before them.
100,1,47,"“My friends,” said he, “I have had a dream from heaven in the"
100,1,48,"dead of night, and its face and figure resembled none but"
100,1,49,"Nestor’s. It hovered over my head and said, ‘You are sleeping,"
100,1,50,son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his host and so much
100,1,51,other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear me at
100,1,52,"once, for I am a messenger from Jove, who, though he be not near,"
100,1,53,yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get the
100,1,54,"Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There are"
100,1,55,no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them
100,1,56,"over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of"
100,1,57,Jove. Remember this.’ The dream then vanished and I awoke. Let us
100,1,58,"now, therefore, arm the sons of the Achaeans. But it will be well"
100,1,59,"that I should first sound them, and to this end I will tell them"
100,1,60,to fly with their ships; but do you others go about among the
100,1,61,host and prevent their doing so.”
100,1,62,"He then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all"
100,1,63,"sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: “My friends,” said"
100,1,64,"he, “princes and councillors of the Argives, if any other man of"
100,1,65,the Achaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it
100,1,66,"false, and would have had nothing to do with it. But he who has"
100,1,67,seen it is the foremost man among us; we must therefore set about
100,1,68,getting the people under arms.”
100,1,69,"With this he led the way from the assembly, and the other"
100,1,70,sceptred kings rose with him in obedience to the word of
100,1,71,Agamemnon; but the people pressed forward to hear. They swarmed
100,1,72,like bees that sally from some hollow cave and flit in countless
100,1,73,"throng among the spring flowers, bunched in knots and clusters;"
100,1,74,even so did the mighty multitude pour from ships and tents to the
100,1,75,"assembly, and range themselves upon the wide - watered shore, while"
100,1,76,"among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them"
100,1,77,ever to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell - mell of mad
100,1,78,"confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as the"
100,1,79,people sought their places. Nine heralds went crying about among
100,1,80,"them to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till"
100,1,81,at last they were got into their several places and ceased their
100,1,82,"clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. This was"
100,1,83,"the work of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. Jove"
100,1,84,"gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide and guardian. King"
100,1,85,"Mercury gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and Pelops to"
100,1,86,"Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when he died, left it to"
100,1,87,"Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to be"
100,1,88,"borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of all Argos and of the"
100,1,89,"isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed the Argives."
100,1,90,"“My friends,” he said, “heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of"
100,1,91,heaven has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his
100,1,92,solemn promise that I should sack the city of Priam before
100,1,93,"returning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me go"
100,1,94,ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is
100,1,95,"the will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust, as"
100,1,96,"he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. It will be a"
100,1,97,"sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean host, at once so great and"
100,1,98,"valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in number than"
100,1,99,themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think that the
100,1,100,"Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that"
100,1,101,they have each been numbered — the Trojans by the roll of their
100,1,102,"householders, and we by companies of ten; think further that each"
100,1,103,of our companies desired to have a Trojan householder to pour out
100,1,104,their wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many a
100,1,105,company would have to go without its cup - bearer. But they have in
100,1,106,"the town allies from other places, and it is these that hinder me"
100,1,107,from being able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of Jove’s
100,1,108,years are gone; the timbers of our ships have rotted; their
100,1,109,tackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home
100,1,110,"look anxiously for our coming, but the work that we came hither"
100,1,111,"to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say:"
100,1,112,"let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take Troy.”"
100,1,113,"With these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of"
100,1,114,them as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to
100,1,115,"and fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and"
100,1,116,south winds break from heaven’s clouds to lash them; or as when
100,1,117,the west wind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow
100,1,118,"beneath the blast, even so were they swayed as they flew with"
100,1,119,"loud cries towards the ships, and the dust from under their feet"
100,1,120,rose heavenward. They cheered each other on to draw the ships
100,1,121,into the sea; they cleared the channels in front of them; they
100,1,122,"began taking away the stays from underneath them, and the welkin"
100,1,123,"rang with their glad cries, so eager were they to return."
100,1,124,Then surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that
100,1,125,"was not fated. But Juno said to Minerva, “Alas, daughter of"
100,1,126,"aegis - bearing Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to"
100,1,127,"their own land over the broad sea, and leave Priam and the"
100,1,128,"Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many"
100,1,129,"of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about"
100,1,130,"at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man,"
100,1,131,that they draw not their ships into the sea.”
100,1,132,Minerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the
100,1,133,"topmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships"
100,1,134,"of the Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in"
100,1,135,"counsel, standing alone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his"
100,1,136,"ship, for he was grieved and sorry; so she went close up to him"
100,1,137,"and said, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are you going to fling"
100,1,138,yourselves into your ships and be off home to your own land in
100,1,139,this way? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still
100,1,140,"keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died"
100,1,141,"at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host,"
100,1,142,"and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their"
100,1,143,ships into the sea.”
100,1,144,Ulysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak
100,1,145,"from him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of"
100,1,146,"Ithaca, who waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon"
100,1,147,Ulysses went straight up to Agamemnon and received from him his
100,1,148,"ancestral, imperishable staff. With this he went about among the"
100,1,149,ships of the Achaeans.
100,1,150,"Whenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke"
100,1,151,"him fairly. “Sir,” said he, “this flight is cowardly and"
100,1,152,"unworthy. Stand to your post, and bid your people also keep their"
100,1,153,places. You do not yet know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was
100,1,154,"sounding us, and ere long will visit the Achaeans with his"
100,1,155,displeasure. We were not all of us at the council to hear what he
100,1,156,then said; see to it lest he be angry and do us a mischief; for
100,1,157,"the pride of kings is great, and the hand of Jove is with them.”"
100,1,158,"But when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he"
100,1,159,"struck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, “Sirrah, hold"
100,1,160,"your peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a"
100,1,161,coward and no soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council;
100,1,162,we cannot all be kings; it is not well that there should be many
100,1,163,masters; one man must be supreme — one king to whom the son of
100,1,164,scheming Saturn has given the sceptre of sovereignty over you
100,1,165,all.”
100,1,166,"Thus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people"
100,1,167,hurried back to the council from their tents and ships with a
100,1,168,sound as the thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the
100,1,169,"shore, and all the sea is in an uproar."
100,1,170,The rest now took their seats and kept to their own several
100,1,171,"places, but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled"
100,1,172,"tongue — a man of many words, and those unseemly; a monger of"
100,1,173,"sedition, a railer against all who were in authority, who cared"
100,1,174,"not what he said, so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh."
100,1,175,He was the ugliest man of all those that came before
100,1,176,"Troy — bandy - legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders"
100,1,177,"rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a point,"
100,1,178,but there was little hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses
100,1,179,"hated him worst of all, for it was with them that he was most"
100,1,180,"wont to wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he"
100,1,181,began heaping his abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and
100,1,182,"disgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling and bawling at"
100,1,183,the son of Atreus.
100,1,184,"“Agamemnon,” he cried, “what ails you now, and what more do you"
100,1,185,"want? Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for"
100,1,186,whenever we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you
100,1,187,"have yet more gold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom"
100,1,188,"for his son, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or"
100,1,189,is it some young girl to hide and lie with? It is not well that
100,1,190,"you, the ruler of the Achaeans, should bring them into such"
100,1,191,"misery. Weakling cowards, women rather than men, let us sail"
100,1,192,"home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to stew in his own meeds"
100,1,193,"of honour, and discover whether we were of any service to him or"
100,1,194,"no. Achilles is a much better man than he is, and see how he has"
100,1,195,treated him — robbing him of his prize and keeping it himself.
100,1,196,"Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son of"
100,1,197,"Atreus, you would never again insult him.”"
100,1,198,"Thus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and"
100,1,199,"rebuked him sternly. “Check your glib tongue, Thersites,” said"
100,1,200,"he, “and babble not a word further. Chide not with princes when"
100,1,201,you have none to back you. There is no viler creature come before
100,1,202,"Troy with the sons of Atreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and"
100,1,203,neither revile them nor keep harping about going home. We do not
100,1,204,"yet know how things are going to be, nor whether the Achaeans are"
100,1,205,to return with good success or evil. How dare you gibe at
100,1,206,Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded him so many prizes? I
100,1,207,"tell you, therefore — and it shall surely be — that if I again catch"
100,1,208,"you talking such nonsense, I will either forfeit my own head and"
100,1,209,"be no more called father of Telemachus, or I will take you, strip"
100,1,210,"you stark naked, and whip you out of the assembly till you go"
100,1,211,blubbering back to the ships.”
100,1,212,On this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders
100,1,213,till he dropped and fell a - weeping. The golden sceptre raised a
100,1,214,"bloody weal on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain,"
100,1,215,looking foolish as he wiped the tears from his eyes. The people
100,1,216,"were sorry for him, yet they laughed heartily, and one would turn"
100,1,217,"to his neighbour saying, “Ulysses has done many a good thing ere"
100,1,218,"now in fight and council, but he never did the Argives a better"
100,1,219,turn than when he stopped this fellow’s mouth from prating
100,1,220,further. He will give the kings no more of his insolence.”
100,1,221,"Thus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and"
100,1,222,"Minerva in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still,"
100,1,223,that those who were far off might hear him and consider his
100,1,224,council. He therefore with all sincerity and goodwill addressed
100,1,225,them thus: —
100,1,226,"“King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by - word among"
100,1,227,all mankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set
100,1,228,"out from Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked"
100,1,229,"the town of Troy, and, like children or widowed women, they"
100,1,230,murmur and would set off homeward. True it is that they have had
100,1,231,toil enough to be disheartened. A man chafes at having to stay
100,1,232,"away from his wife even for a single month, when he is on"
100,1,233,"shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it is now nine long"
100,1,234,"years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore, blame the"
100,1,235,Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we go
100,1,236,"home empty after so long a stay — therefore, my friends, be patient"
100,1,237,yet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings of
100,1,238,Calchas were false or true.
100,1,239,“All who have not since perished must remember as though it were
100,1,240,"yesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were"
100,1,241,detained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on
100,1,242,Priam and the Trojans. We were ranged round about a fountain
100,1,243,"offering hecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there"
100,1,244,was a fine plane - tree from beneath which there welled a stream of
100,1,245,pure water. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful
100,1,246,"serpent out of the ground, with blood - red stains upon its back,"
100,1,247,and it darted from under the altar on to the plane - tree. Now
100,1,248,"there was a brood of young sparrows, quite small, upon the"
100,1,249,"topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves, eight in all,"
100,1,250,and their mother that hatched them made nine. The serpent ate the
100,1,251,"poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting her"
100,1,252,little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught
100,1,253,"her by the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had eaten"
100,1,254,"both the sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him"
100,1,255,become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into
100,1,256,"stone, and we stood there wondering at that which had come to"
100,1,257,"pass. Seeing, then, that such a fearful portent had broken in"
100,1,258,"upon our hecatombs, Calchas forthwith declared to us the oracles"
100,1,259,"of heaven. ‘Why, Achaeans,’ said he, ‘are you thus speechless?"
100,1,260,"Jove has sent us this sign, long in coming, and long ere it be"
100,1,261,"fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever. As the serpent"
100,1,262,"ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that hatched them, which"
100,1,263,"makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at Troy, but in the"
100,1,264,"tenth shall take the town.’ This was what he said, and now it is"
100,1,265,"all coming true. Stay here, therefore, all of you, till we take"
100,1,266,the city of Priam.”
100,1,267,"On this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again"
100,1,268,"with the uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them."
100,1,269,"“Shame on you,” he cried, “to stay talking here like children,"
100,1,270,"when you should fight like men. Where are our covenants now, and"
100,1,271,where the oaths that we have taken? Shall our counsels be flung
100,1,272,"into the fire, with our drink - offerings and the right hands of"
100,1,273,fellowship wherein we have put our trust? We waste our time in
100,1,274,"words, and for all our talking here shall be no further forward."
100,1,275,"Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your own steadfast purpose;"
100,1,276,"lead the Argives on to battle, and leave this handful of men to"
100,1,277,"rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain, to get back to Argos ere"
100,1,278,they have learned whether Jove be true or a liar. For the mighty
100,1,279,"son of Saturn surely promised that we should succeed, when we"
100,1,280,Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans.
100,1,281,He showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning on our
100,1,282,right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has
100,1,283,"first lain with the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and"
100,1,284,"sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless,"
100,1,285,"if any man is in such haste to be at home again, let him lay his"
100,1,286,hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all.
100,1,287,"But, O king, consider and give ear to my counsel, for the word"
100,1,288,"that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide your men,"
100,1,289,"Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and"
100,1,290,"tribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if"
100,1,291,"the Achaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and"
100,1,292,"peoples, are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie"
100,1,293,against the other. Thus you shall also learn whether it is
100,1,294,through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice of man that you
100,1,295,shall fail to take the town.”
100,1,296,"And Agamemnon answered, “Nestor, you have again outdone the sons"
100,1,297,"of the Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and"
100,1,298,"Apollo, that I had among them ten more such councillors, for the"
100,1,299,"city of King Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we"
100,1,300,should sack it. But the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless
100,1,301,wranglings and strife. Achilles and I are quarrelling about this
100,1,302,"girl, in which matter I was the first to offend; if we can be of"
100,1,303,"one mind again, the Trojans will not stave off destruction for a"
100,1,304,"day. Now, therefore, get your morning meal, that our hosts join"
100,1,305,in fight. Whet well your spears; see well to the ordering of your
100,1,306,"shields; give good feeds to your horses, and look your chariots"
100,1,307,"carefully over, that we may do battle the livelong day; for we"
100,1,308,"shall have no rest, not for a moment, till night falls to part"
100,1,309,us. The bands that bear your shields shall be wet with the sweat
100,1,310,"upon your shoulders, your hands shall weary upon your spears,"
100,1,311,"your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, and if I see"
100,1,312,"any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at the"
100,1,313,"ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey to"
100,1,314,dogs and vultures.”
100,1,315,"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the"
100,1,316,waves run high before the blast of the south wind and break on
100,1,317,"some lofty headland, dashing against it and buffeting it without"
100,1,318,"ceasing, as the storms from every quarter drive them, even so did"
100,1,319,the Achaeans rise and hurry in all directions to their ships.
100,1,320,"There they lighted their fires at their tents and got dinner,"
100,1,321,"offering sacrifice every man to one or other of the gods, and"
100,1,322,praying each one of them that he might live to come out of the
100,1,323,"fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five - year - old"
100,1,324,"bull to the mighty son of Saturn, and invited the princes and"
100,1,325,"elders of his host. First he asked Nestor and King Idomeneus,"
100,1,326,"then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly Ulysses,"
100,1,327,"peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his own accord, for"
100,1,328,he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round the bull
100,1,329,"with the barley - meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed,"
100,1,330,"saying, “Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven,"
100,1,331,"and ridest upon the storm - cloud, grant that the sun may not go"
100,1,332,"down, nor the night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low,"
100,1,333,and its gates are consumed with fire. Grant that my sword may
100,1,334,"pierce the shirt of Hector about his heart, and that full many of"
100,1,335,his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round him.”
100,1,336,"Thus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his"
100,1,337,"prayer. He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased"
100,1,338,their toil continually. When they had done praying and sprinkling
100,1,339,"the barley - meal upon the victim, they drew back its head, killed"
100,1,340,"it, and then flayed it. They cut out the thigh - bones, wrapped"
100,1,341,"them round in two layers of fat, and set pieces of raw meat on"
100,1,342,the top of them. These they burned upon the split logs of
100,1,343,"firewood, but they spitted the inward meats, and held them in the"
100,1,344,"flames to cook. When the thigh - bones were burned, and they had"
100,1,345,"tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the"
100,1,346,"pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew"
100,1,347,"them off; then, when they had finished their work and the feast"
100,1,348,"was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that"
100,1,349,all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and
100,1,350,"drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. “King"
100,1,351,"Agamemnon,” said he, “let us not stay talking here, nor be slack"
100,1,352,in the work that heaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds
100,1,353,summon the people to gather at their several ships; we will then
100,1,354,"go about among the host, that we may begin fighting at once.”"
100,1,355,"Thus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once"
100,1,356,sent the criers round to call the people in assembly. So they
100,1,357,"called them, and the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about"
100,1,358,"the son of Atreus chose their men and marshalled them, while"
100,1,359,Minerva went among them holding her priceless aegis that knows
100,1,360,neither age nor death. From it there waved a hundred tassels of
100,1,361,"pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of them worth a hundred"
100,1,362,oxen. With this she darted furiously everywhere among the hosts
100,1,363,"of the Achaeans, urging them forward, and putting courage into"
100,1,364,"the heart of each, so that he might fight and do battle without"
100,1,365,ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in their eyes even than
100,1,366,returning home in their ships. As when some great forest fire is
100,1,367,"raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so as"
100,1,368,they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the
100,1,369,firmament of heaven.
100,1,370,"They were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the"
100,1,371,"plain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and"
100,1,372,"thither, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they"
100,1,373,settle till the fen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did
100,1,374,their tribes pour from ships and tents on to the plain of the
100,1,375,"Scamander, and the ground rang as brass under the feet of men and"
100,1,376,horses. They stood as thick upon the flower - bespangled field as
100,1,377,leaves that bloom in summer.
100,1,378,As countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman’s homestead
100,1,379,"in the time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even"
100,1,380,so did the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans
100,1,381,and destroy them.
100,1,382,The chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight
100,1,383,"began, drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their"
100,1,384,flocks when they have got mixed while feeding; and among them
100,1,385,"went King Agamemnon, with a head and face like Jove the lord of"
100,1,386,"thunder, a waist like Mars, and a chest like that of Neptune. As"
100,1,387,"some great bull that lords it over the herds upon the plain, even"
100,1,388,so did Jove make the son of Atreus stand peerless among the
100,1,389,multitude of heroes.
100,1,390,"And now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell"
100,1,391,me — for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see
100,1,392,"all things, while we know nothing but by report — who were the"
100,1,393,"chiefs and princes of the Danaans? As for the common soldiers,"
100,1,394,they were so that I could not name every single one of them
100,1,395,"though I had ten tongues, and though my voice failed not and my"
100,1,396,"heart were of bronze within me, unless you, O Olympian Muses,"
100,1,397,"daughters of aegis - bearing Jove, were to recount them to me."
100,1,398,"Nevertheless, I will tell the captains of the ships and all the"
100,1,399,fleet together.
100,1,400,"Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were"
100,1,401,captains of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria
100,1,402,"and rocky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands"
100,1,403,"of Eteonus, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of"
100,1,404,"Mycalessus. They also held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and"
100,1,405,"they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress"
100,1,406,"of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt of doves;"
100,1,407,"Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and Glisas; the"
100,1,408,fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous grove
100,1,409,"of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and"
100,1,410,"Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in"
100,1,411,each there were a hundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians.
100,1,412,"Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt"
100,1,413,in Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble
100,1,414,maiden bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had
100,1,415,"gone with Mars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain"
100,1,416,with her. With these there came thirty ships.
100,1,417,"The Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty"
100,1,418,Iphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held
100,1,419,"Cyparissus, rocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they"
100,1,420,"also that dwelt in Anemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters"
100,1,421,"of the river Cephissus, and Lilaea by the springs of the"
100,1,422,"Cephissus; with their chieftains came forty ships, and they"
100,1,423,"marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, which were stationed next"
100,1,424,"to the Boeotians, on their left."
100,1,425,"Ajax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not"
100,1,426,"so great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was"
100,1,427,"a little man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use"
100,1,428,of the spear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These
100,1,429,"dwelt in Cynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae,"
100,1,430,"Tarphe, and Thronium about the river Boagrius. With him there"
100,1,431,came forty ships of the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea.
100,1,432,"The fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,"
100,1,433,"Histiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the"
100,1,434,rock - perched town of Dium; with them were also the men of
100,1,435,Carystus and Styra; Elephenor of the race of Mars was in command
100,1,436,"of these; he was son of Chalcodon, and chief over all the"
100,1,437,"Abantes. With him they came, fleet of foot and wearing their hair"
100,1,438,"long behind, brave warriors, who would ever strive to tear open"
100,1,439,the corslets of their foes with their long ashen spears. Of these
100,1,440,there came fifty ships.
100,1,441,"And they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great"
100,1,442,"Erechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove’s daughter,"
100,1,443,"Minerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own"
100,1,444,"rich sanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship"
100,1,445,him with sacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by
100,1,446,"Menestheus, son of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the"
100,1,447,marshalling of chariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone
100,1,448,"rival him, for he was older. With him there came fifty ships."
100,1,449,"Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them"
100,1,450,alongside those of the Athenians.
100,1,451,"The men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns,"
100,1,452,"with Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the"
100,1,453,"vineyard lands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who"
100,1,454,came from Aegina and Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud
100,1,455,"battle - cry, and Sthenelus son of famed Capaneus. With them in"
100,1,456,"command was Euryalus, son of king Mecisteus, son of Talaus; but"
100,1,457,Diomed was chief over them all. With these there came eighty
100,1,458,ships.
100,1,459,"Those who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and"
100,1,460,"Cleonae; Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned"
100,1,461,"of old; Hyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the"
100,1,462,coast - land round about Helice; these sent a hundred ships under
100,1,463,"the command of King Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was far"
100,1,464,"both finest and most numerous, and in their midst was the king"
100,1,465,"himself, all glorious in his armour of gleaming bronze — foremost"
100,1,466,"among the heroes, for he was the greatest king, and had most men"
100,1,467,under him.
100,1,468,"And those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills,"
100,1,469,"Pharis, Sparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae,"
100,1,470,"Amyclae, and Helos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus;"
100,1,471,"these were led by Menelaus of the loud battle - cry, brother to"
100,1,472,"Agamemnon, and of them there were sixty ships, drawn up apart"
100,1,473,"from the others. Among them went Menelaus himself, strong in"
100,1,474,"zeal, urging his men to fight; for he longed to avenge the toil"
100,1,475,and sorrow that he had suffered for the sake of Helen.
100,1,476,"The men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the"
100,1,477,"river Alpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum,"
100,1,478,"Helos, and Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his"
100,1,479,"minstrelsy for ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where"
100,1,480,"Eurytus lived and reigned, and boasted that he would surpass even"
100,1,481,"the Muses, daughters of aegis - bearing Jove, if they should sing"
100,1,482,"against him; whereon they were angry, and maimed him. They robbed"
100,1,483,"him of his divine power of song, and thenceforth he could strike"
100,1,484,"the lyre no more. These were commanded by Nestor, knight of"
100,1,485,"Gerene, and with him there came ninety ships."
100,1,486,"And those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene,"
100,1,487,"near the tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand;"
100,1,488,"the men of Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of"
100,1,489,"Rhipae, Stratie, and bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of"
100,1,490,Stymphelus and Parrhasia; of these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus
100,1,491,"was commander, and they had sixty ships. Many Arcadians, good"
100,1,492,"soldiers, came in each one of them, but Agamemnon found them the"
100,1,493,"ships in which to cross the sea, for they were not a people that"
100,1,494,occupied their business upon the waters.
100,1,495,"The men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is"
100,1,496,"enclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea - shore, the rock"
100,1,497,"Olene and Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had"
100,1,498,"ten ships, with many Epeans on board. Their captains were"
100,1,499,"Amphimachus and Thalpius — the one, son of Cteatus, and the other,"
100,1,500,"of Eurytus — both of the race of Actor. The two others were Diores,"
100,1,501,"son of Amarynces, and Polyxenus, son of King Agasthenes, son of"
100,1,502,Augeas.
100,1,503,"And those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who"
100,1,504,"dwelt beyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of"
100,1,505,"Mars, and the son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who"
100,1,506,"quarrelled with his father, and went to settle in Dulichium. With"
100,1,507,him there came forty ships.
100,1,508,"Ulysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum"
100,1,509,"with its forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus,"
100,1,510,with the mainland also that was over against the islands. These
100,1,511,"were led by Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there"
100,1,512,came twelve ships.
100,1,513,"Thoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in"
100,1,514,"Pleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon,"
100,1,515,"for the great king Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself"
100,1,516,"dead, as was also golden - haired Meleager, who had been set over"
100,1,517,the Aetolians to be their king. And with Thoas there came forty
100,1,518,ships.
100,1,519,"The famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,"
100,1,520,"and the well - walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and"
100,1,521,Lycastus that lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus
100,1,522,"and Rhytium, with the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred"
100,1,523,"cities of Crete. All these were led by Idomeneus, and by"
100,1,524,"Meriones, peer of murderous Mars. And with these there came"
100,1,525,eighty ships.
100,1,526,"Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of"
100,1,527,"stature, brought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These"
100,1,528,dwelt in Rhodes which is divided among the three cities of
100,1,529,"Lindus, Ielysus, and Cameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These"
100,1,530,"were commanded by Tlepolemus, son of Hercules by Astyochea, whom"
100,1,531,"he had carried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, after"
100,1,532,"sacking many cities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemus grew up,"
100,1,533,"he killed his father’s uncle Licymnius, who had been a famous"
100,1,534,"warrior in his time, but was then grown old. On this he built"
100,1,535,"himself a fleet, gathered a great following, and fled beyond the"
100,1,536,"sea, for he was menaced by the other sons and grandsons of"
100,1,537,"Hercules. After a voyage, during which he suffered great"
100,1,538,"hardship, he came to Rhodes, where the people divided into three"
100,1,539,"communities, according to their tribes, and were dearly loved by"
100,1,540,"Jove, the lord of gods and men; wherefore the son of Saturn"
100,1,541,showered down great riches upon them.
100,1,542,"And Nireus brought three ships from Syme — Nireus, who was the"
100,1,543,handsomest man that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after
100,1,544,"the son of Peleus — but he was a man of no substance, and had but a"
100,1,545,small following.
100,1,546,"And those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the"
100,1,547,"city of Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were"
100,1,548,"commanded by Pheidippus and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus"
100,1,549,the son of Hercules. And with them there came thirty ships.
100,1,550,"Those again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis;"
100,1,551,"and those of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were"
100,1,552,"called Myrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships,"
100,1,553,over which Achilles was in command. But they now took no part in
100,1,554,"the war, inasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for"
100,1,555,"Achilles stayed by his ships, furious about the loss of the girl"
100,1,556,"Briseis, whom he had taken from Lyrnessus at his own great peril,"
100,1,557,"when he had sacked Lyrnessus and Thebe, and had overthrown Mynes"
100,1,558,"and Epistrophus, sons of king Evenor, son of Selepus. For her"
100,1,559,"sake Achilles was still grieving, but ere long he was again to"
100,1,560,join them.
100,1,561,"And those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus,"
100,1,562,"sanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the"
100,1,563,"sea, and Pteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave"
100,1,564,"Protesilaus had been captain while he was yet alive, but he was"
100,1,565,now lying under the earth. He had left a wife behind him in
100,1,566,"Phylace to tear her cheeks in sorrow, and his house was only half"
100,1,567,"finished, for he was slain by a Dardanian warrior while leaping"
100,1,568,"foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil of Troy. Still, though his"
100,1,569,"people mourned their chieftain, they were not without a leader,"
100,1,570,"for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled them; he was son of"
100,1,571,"Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son of Phylacus, and he was"
100,1,572,"own brother to Protesilaus, only younger, Protesilaus being at"
100,1,573,once the elder and the more valiant. So the people were not
100,1,574,"without a leader, though they mourned him whom they had lost."
100,1,575,With him there came forty ships.
100,1,576,"And those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe,"
100,1,577,"Glaphyrae, and the populous city of Iolcus, these with their"
100,1,578,"eleven ships were led by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis"
100,1,579,"bore to him, loveliest of the daughters of Pelias."
100,1,580,"And those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and"
100,1,581,"rugged Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes,"
100,1,582,"and they had seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them"
100,1,583,good archers; but Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the
100,1,584,"Island of Lemnos, where the sons of the Achaeans left him, for he"
100,1,585,had been bitten by a poisonous water snake. There he lay sick and
100,1,586,"sorry, and full soon did the Argives come to miss him. But his"
100,1,587,"people, though they felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon,"
100,1,588,"the bastard son of Oileus by Rhene, set them in array."
100,1,589,"Those, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they"
100,1,590,"that held Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were"
100,1,591,"commanded by the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of"
100,1,592,"healing, Podalirius and Machaon. And with them there came thirty"
100,1,593,ships.
100,1,594,"The men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia,"
100,1,595,"with those that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus,"
100,1,596,"these were led by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them"
100,1,597,there came forty ships.
100,1,598,"Those that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white"
100,1,599,"city of Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was"
100,1,600,"son of Pirithous, who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia"
100,1,601,bore him to Pirithous on the day when he took his revenge on the
100,1,602,shaggy mountain savages and drove them from Mt. Pelion to the
100,1,603,"Aithices. But Polypoetes was not sole in command, for with him"
100,1,604,"was Leonteus, of the race of Mars, who was son of Coronus, the"
100,1,605,son of Caeneus. And with these there came forty ships.
100,1,606,"Guneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was"
100,1,607,"followed by the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about"
100,1,608,"wintry Dodona, and held the lands round the lovely river"
100,1,609,"Titaresius, which sends its waters into the Peneus. They do not"
100,1,610,"mingle with the silver eddies of the Peneus, but flow on the top"
100,1,611,of them like oil; for the Titaresius is a branch of dread Orcus
100,1,612,and of the river Styx.
100,1,613,"Of the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They"
100,1,614,were they that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion.
100,1,615,"Prothous, fleet of foot, was their leader, and with him there"
100,1,616,came forty ships.
100,1,617,"Such were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O"
100,1,618,"Muse, was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that"
100,1,619,followed after the sons of Atreus?
100,1,620,"Of the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest."
100,1,621,"They were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They"
100,1,622,"were of the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height."
100,1,623,"Apollo, of the silver bow, had bred them in Perea — both of them"
100,1,624,"mares, and terrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of"
100,1,625,"Telamon, was much the foremost so long as Achilles’ anger lasted,"
100,1,626,for Achilles excelled him greatly and he had also better horses;
100,1,627,but Achilles was now holding aloof at his ships by reason of his
100,1,628,"quarrel with Agamemnon, and his people passed their time upon the"
100,1,629,"sea shore, throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and in"
100,1,630,"archery. Their horses stood each by his own chariot, champing"
100,1,631,"lotus and wild celery. The chariots were housed under cover, but"
100,1,632,"their owners, for lack of leadership, wandered hither and thither"
100,1,633,about the host and went not forth to fight.
100,1,634,"Thus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth"
100,1,635,groaned beneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes
100,1,636,"the land about Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus"
100,1,637,lies. Even so did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over
100,1,638,the plain.
100,1,639,"And now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad"
100,1,640,"news among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and"
100,1,641,"young, at Priam’s gates, and Iris came close up to Priam,"
100,1,642,"speaking with the voice of Priam’s son Polites, who, being fleet"
100,1,643,"of foot, was stationed as watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of"
100,1,644,"old Aesyetes, to look out for any sally of the Achaeans. In his"
100,1,645,"likeness Iris spoke, saying, “Old man, you talk idly, as in time"
100,1,646,"of peace, while war is at hand. I have been in many a battle, but"
100,1,647,never yet saw such a host as is now advancing. They are crossing
100,1,648,the plain to attack the city as thick as leaves or as the sands
100,1,649,"of the sea. Hector, I charge you above all others, do as I say."
100,1,650,There are many allies dispersed about the city of Priam from
100,1,651,"distant places and speaking divers tongues. Therefore, let each"
100,1,652,"chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally in"
100,1,653,array and leading them forth to battle.”
100,1,654,"Thus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at"
100,1,655,once broke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates
100,1,656,"were opened, and the people thronged through them, horse and"
100,1,657,"foot, with the tramp as of a great multitude."
100,1,658,"Now there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon"
100,1,659,"the plain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the"
100,1,660,tomb of lithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided
100,1,661,their forces.
100,1,662,"Priam’s son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the"
100,1,663,"Trojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and"
100,1,664,most valiant of those who were longing for the fray.
100,1,665,"The Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to"
100,1,666,"Anchises, when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him"
100,1,667,"upon the mountain slopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him"
100,1,668,"were the two sons of Antenor, Archilochus and Acamas, both"
100,1,669,skilled in all the arts of war.
100,1,670,"They that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men"
100,1,671,"of substance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are"
100,1,672,"of Trojan blood — these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom"
100,1,673,Apollo had taught to use the bow.
100,1,674,"They that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia,"
100,1,675,and the high mountain of Tereia — these were led by Adrestus and
100,1,676,"Amphius, whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of"
100,1,677,"Merops of Percote, who excelled in all kinds of divination. He"
100,1,678,"told them not to take part in the war, but they gave him no heed,"
100,1,679,for fate lured them to destruction.
100,1,680,"They that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos,"
100,1,681,"and Arisbe — these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave"
100,1,682,"commander — Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay"
100,1,683,"steeds, of the breed that comes from the river Selleis, had"
100,1,684,brought from Arisbe.
100,1,685,"Hippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in"
100,1,686,"fertile Larissa — Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two"
100,1,687,"sons of the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus."
100,1,688,Acamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those
100,1,689,that came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.
100,1,690,"Euphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the"
100,1,691,Ciconian spearsmen.
100,1,692,"Pyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the"
100,1,693,"broad waters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the"
100,1,694,earth.
100,1,695,The Paphlagonians were commanded by stout - hearted Pylaemanes from
100,1,696,"Enetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that"
100,1,697,"held Cytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by"
100,1,698,"the river Parthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini."
100,1,699,Odius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from
100,1,700,"distant Alybe, where there are mines of silver."
100,1,701,"Chromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in"
100,1,702,"augury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by"
100,1,703,"the hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he"
100,1,704,slew others also of the Trojans.
100,1,705,"Phorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far"
100,1,706,"country of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray."
100,1,707,"Mesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes,"
100,1,708,"born to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who"
100,1,709,dwelt under Mt. Tmolus.
100,1,710,"Nastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held"
100,1,711,"Miletus and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of"
100,1,712,the river Maeander and the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were
100,1,713,"commanded by Nastes and Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He"
100,1,714,"came into the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that"
100,1,715,"he was, his gold was of no avail to save him, for he fell in the"
100,1,716,"river by the hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and Achilles"
100,1,717,bore away his gold.
100,1,718,"Sarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by"
100,1,719,the eddying waters of the Xanthus.
100,2,1,"Alexandria, also called Paris, challenges Menelaus — Helen and"
100,2,2,Priam view the Achaeans from the wall — The covenant — Paris and
100,2,3,"Menelaus fight, and Paris is worsted — Venus carries him off to"
100,2,4,save him — Scene between him and Helen.
100,2,5,"When the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,"
100,2,6,the Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that
100,2,7,scream overhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing
100,2,8,"waters of Oceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies,"
100,2,9,and they wrangle in the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched
100,2,10,"silently, in high heart, and minded to stand by one another."
100,2,11,As when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the
100,2,12,"mountain tops, bad for shepherds but better than night for"
100,2,13,"thieves, and a man can see no further than he can throw a stone,"
100,2,14,even so rose the dust from under their feet as they made all
100,2,15,speed over the plain.
100,2,16,"When they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward"
100,2,17,as champion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin
100,2,18,"of a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two"
100,2,19,spears shod with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the
100,2,20,Achaeans to meet him in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus
100,2,21,"stride out before the ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that"
100,2,22,"lights on the carcase of some goat or horned stag, and devours it"
100,2,23,"there and then, though dogs and youths set upon him. Even thus"
100,2,24,"was Menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight of Alexandrus, for"
100,2,25,"he deemed that now he should be revenged. He sprang, therefore,"
100,2,26,"from his chariot, clad in his suit of armour."
100,2,27,"Alexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in"
100,2,28,fear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back
100,2,29,"affrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a"
100,2,30,"serpent in some mountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge"
100,2,31,"into the throng of Trojan warriors, terror - stricken at the sight"
100,2,32,of the son of Atreus.
100,2,33,"Then Hector upbraided him. “Paris,” said he, “evil - hearted Paris,"
100,2,34,"fair to see, but woman - mad, and false of tongue, would that you"
100,2,35,"had never been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than"
100,2,36,live to be disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans
100,2,37,mock at us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is
100,2,38,"fair to see but who has neither wit nor courage? Did you not,"
100,2,39,"such as you are, get your following together and sail beyond the"
100,2,40,seas? Did you not from your a far country carry off a lovely
100,2,41,woman wedded among a people of warriors — to bring sorrow upon your
100,2,42,"father, your city, and your whole country, but joy to your"
100,2,43,"enemies, and hang - dog shamefacedness to yourself? And now can you"
100,2,44,not dare face Menelaus and learn what manner of man he is whose
100,2,45,wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be your lyre and your
100,2,46,"love - tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour, when you"
100,2,47,were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a weak - kneed
100,2,48,"people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones for the"
100,2,49,wrongs you have done them.”
100,2,50,"And Alexandrus answered, “Hector, your rebuke is just. You are"
100,2,51,"hard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and"
100,2,52,"cleaves the timber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen"
100,2,53,"is the edge of your scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts"
100,2,54,that golden Venus has given me; they are precious; let not a man
100,2,55,"disdain them, for the gods give them where they are minded, and"
100,2,56,none can have them for the asking. If you would have me do battle
100,2,57,"with Menelaus, bid the Trojans and Achaeans take their seats,"
100,2,58,while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all her wealth.
100,2,59,Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man
100,2,60,"take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home, but let"
100,2,61,the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you Trojans
100,2,62,"shall stay here in Troy, while the others go home to Argos and"
100,2,63,the land of the Achaeans.”
100,2,64,"When Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the"
100,2,65,"Trojan ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back,"
100,2,66,and they all sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still
100,2,67,"aimed at him with stones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to"
100,2,68,"them saying, “Hold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans;"
100,2,69,Hector desires to speak.”
100,2,70,"They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke."
100,2,71,"“Hear from my mouth,” said he, “Trojans and Achaeans, the saying"
100,2,72,"of Alexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids"
100,2,73,"the Trojans and Achaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while"
100,2,74,he and Menelaus fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her
100,2,75,wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the
100,2,76,"better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his"
100,2,77,"own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace.”"
100,2,78,"Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of"
100,2,79,"the loud battle - cry addressed them. “And now,” he said, “hear me"
100,2,80,"too, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the"
100,2,81,"parting of Achaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be,"
100,2,82,seeing how much have suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and
100,2,83,"the wrong he did me. Let him who shall die, die, and let the"
100,2,84,"others fight no more. Bring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a"
100,2,85,"black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will bring a third for Jove."
100,2,86,"Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may swear to the"
100,2,87,"covenant himself; for his sons are high - handed and ill to trust,"
100,2,88,and the oaths of Jove must not be transgressed or taken in vain.
100,2,89,"Young men’s minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he"
100,2,90,"looks before and after, deeming that which shall be fairest upon"
100,2,91,both sides.”
100,2,92,"The Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they"
100,2,93,thought that they should now have rest. They backed their
100,2,94,"chariots toward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their"
100,2,95,"armour, laying it down upon the ground; and the hosts were near"
100,2,96,to one another with a little space between them. Hector sent two
100,2,97,"messengers to the city to bring the lambs and to bid Priam come,"
100,2,98,while Agamemnon told Talthybius to fetch the other lamb from the
100,2,99,"ships, and he did as Agamemnon had said."
100,2,100,"Meanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister - in - law,"
100,2,101,"wife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had"
100,2,102,"married Laodice, the fairest of Priam’s daughters. She found her"
100,2,103,"in her own room, working at a great web of purple linen, on which"
100,2,104,"she was embroidering the battles between Trojans and Achaeans,"
100,2,105,that Mars had made them fight for her sake. Iris then came close
100,2,106,"up to her and said, “Come hither, child, and see the strange"
100,2,107,doings of the Trojans and Achaeans. Till now they have been
100,2,108,"warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now they"
100,2,109,"have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields,"
100,2,110,sitting still with their spears planted beside them. Alexandrus
100,2,111,"and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to be"
100,2,112,the wife of him who is the victor.”
100,2,113,"Thus spoke the goddess, and Helen’s heart yearned after her"
100,2,114,"former husband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white"
100,2,115,"mantle over her head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she"
100,2,116,"went, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae,"
100,2,117,"daughter of Pittheus, and Clymene. And straightway they were at"
100,2,118,the Scaean gates.
100,2,119,"The two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were"
100,2,120,"seated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes,"
100,2,121,"Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too"
100,2,122,"old to fight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the tower"
100,2,123,like cicales that chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high
100,2,124,"tree in a wood. When they saw Helen coming towards the tower,"
100,2,125,"they said softly to one another, “Small wonder that Trojans and"
100,2,126,"Achaeans should endure so much and so long, for the sake of a"
100,2,127,"woman so marvellously and divinely lovely. Still, fair though she"
100,2,128,"be, let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow for us and"
100,2,129,for our children after us.”
100,2,130,"But Priam bade her draw nigh. “My child,” said he, “take your"
100,2,131,"seat in front of me that you may see your former husband, your"
100,2,132,"kinsmen and your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the"
100,2,133,"gods, not you who are to blame. It is they that have brought"
100,2,134,"about this terrible war with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is"
100,2,135,yonder huge hero so great and goodly? I have seen men taller by a
100,2,136,"head, but none so comely and so royal. Surely he must be a king.”"
100,2,137,"“Sir,” answered Helen, “father of my husband, dear and reverend"
100,2,138,"in my eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have"
100,2,139,"come here with your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends,"
100,2,140,"my darling daughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But"
100,2,141,"it was not to be, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for"
100,2,142,"your question, the hero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of"
100,2,143,"Atreus, a good king and a brave soldier, brother - in - law as surely"
100,2,144,"as that he lives, to my abhorred and miserable self.”"
100,2,145,"The old man marvelled at him and said, “Happy son of Atreus,"
100,2,146,child of good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you
100,2,147,"in great multitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen,"
100,2,148,"the people of Otreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the"
100,2,149,"banks of the river Sangarius; I was their ally, and with them"
100,2,150,"when the Amazons, peers of men, came up against them, but even"
100,2,151,they were not so many as the Achaeans.”
100,2,152,"The old man next looked upon Ulysses; “Tell me,” he said, “who is"
100,2,153,"that other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across"
100,2,154,"the chest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and"
100,2,155,he stalks in front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram
100,2,156,ordering his ewes.”
100,2,157,"And Helen answered, “He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of"
100,2,158,"Laertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner"
100,2,159,of stratagems and subtle cunning.”
100,2,160,"On this Antenor said, “Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once"
100,2,161,"came here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I"
100,2,162,"received them in my own house, and therefore know both of them by"
100,2,163,sight and conversation. When they stood up in presence of the
100,2,164,"assembled Trojans, Menelaus was the broader shouldered, but when"
100,2,165,both were seated Ulysses had the more royal presence. After a
100,2,166,"time they delivered their message, and the speech of Menelaus ran"
100,2,167,"trippingly on the tongue; he did not say much, for he was a man"
100,2,168,"of few words, but he spoke very clearly and to the point, though"
100,2,169,"he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses, on the other hand,"
100,2,170,"when he rose to speak, was at first silent and kept his eyes"
100,2,171,fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful movement of
100,2,172,his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man unpractised
100,2,173,in oratory — one might have taken him for a mere churl or
100,2,174,"simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came"
100,2,175,"driving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind,"
100,2,176,"then there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of"
100,2,177,what he looked like.”
100,2,178,"Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, “Who is that great and"
100,2,179,goodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the
100,2,180,rest of the Argives?”
100,2,181,"“That,” answered Helen, “is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans,"
100,2,182,"and on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus"
100,2,183,"looking like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round"
100,2,184,him. Often did Menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when
100,2,185,"he came visiting us from Crete. I see, moreover, many other"
100,2,186,"Achaeans whose names I could tell you, but there are two whom I"
100,2,187,"can nowhere find, Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux the"
100,2,188,"mighty boxer; they are children of my mother, and own brothers to"
100,2,189,"myself. Either they have not left Lacedaemon, or else, though"
100,2,190,"they have brought their ships, they will not show themselves in"
100,2,191,battle for the shame and disgrace that I have brought upon them.”
100,2,192,She knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the
100,2,193,earth in their own land of Lacedaemon.
100,2,194,Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath - offerings
100,2,195,"through the city — two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of"
100,2,196,earth; and Idaeus brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold.
100,2,197,"He went up to Priam and said, “Son of Laomedon, the princes of"
100,2,198,the Trojans and Achaeans bid you come down on to the plain and
100,2,199,swear to a solemn covenant. Alexandrus and Menelaus are to fight
100,2,200,"for Helen in single combat, that she and all her wealth may go"
100,2,201,with him who is the victor. We are to swear to a solemn covenant
100,2,202,"of peace whereby we others shall dwell here in Troy, while the"
100,2,203,Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.”
100,2,204,"The old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the"
100,2,205,"horses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,"
100,2,206,"gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside"
100,2,207,him; they then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain.
100,2,208,When they reached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left
100,2,209,"the chariot, and with measured pace advanced into the space"
100,2,210,between the hosts.
100,2,211,Agamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants
100,2,212,brought on the oath - offerings and mixed the wine in the
100,2,213,"mixing - bowls; they poured water over the hands of the chieftains,"
100,2,214,"and the son of Atreus drew the dagger that hung by his sword, and"
100,2,215,cut wool from the lambs’ heads; this the men - servants gave about
100,2,216,"among the Trojan and Achaean princes, and the son of Atreus"
100,2,217,"lifted up his hands in prayer. “Father Jove,” he cried, “that"
100,2,218,"rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and thou oh Sun, that"
100,2,219,"seest and givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers, and ye who"
100,2,220,in the realms below chastise the soul of him that has broken his
100,2,221,"oath, witness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain."
100,2,222,"If Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and all her"
100,2,223,"wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but if Menelaus kills"
100,2,224,"Alexandrus, let the Trojans give back Helen and all that she has;"
100,2,225,let them moreover pay such fine to the Achaeans as shall be
100,2,226,"agreed upon, in testimony among those that shall be born"
100,2,227,hereafter. And if Priam and his sons refuse such fine when
100,2,228,"Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay here and fight on till I"
100,2,229,have got satisfaction.”
100,2,230,"As he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims,"
100,2,231,"and laid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the"
100,2,232,knife had reft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from
100,2,233,"the mixing - bowl into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting"
100,2,234,"gods, saying, Trojans and Achaeans among one another, “Jove, most"
100,2,235,"great and glorious, and ye other everlasting gods, grant that the"
100,2,236,brains of them who shall first sin against their oaths — of them
100,2,237,"and their children — may be shed upon the ground even as this wine,"
100,2,238,and let their wives become the slaves of strangers.”
100,2,239,"Thus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their"
100,2,240,"prayer. Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, “Hear"
100,2,241,"me, Trojans and Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind - beaten"
100,2,242,city of Ilius: I dare not with my own eyes witness this fight
100,2,243,"between my son and Menelaus, for Jove and the other immortals"
100,2,244,alone know which shall fall.”
100,2,245,On this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat.
100,2,246,"He gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him;"
100,2,247,the two then went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the
100,2,248,"ground, and cast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should"
100,2,249,take aim first. Meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and
100,2,250,"prayed saying, “Father Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious"
100,2,251,"in power, grant that he who first brought about this war between"
100,2,252,"us may die, and enter the house of Hades, while we others remain"
100,2,253,at peace and abide by our oaths.”
100,2,254,"Great Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,"
100,2,255,and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their
100,2,256,"several stations, each by his horses and the place where his arms"
100,2,257,"were lying, while Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his"
100,2,258,goodly armour. First he greaved his legs with greaves of good
100,2,259,make and fitted with ancle - clasps of silver; after this he donned
100,2,260,"the cuirass of his brother Lycaon, and fitted it to his own body;"
100,2,261,"he hung his silver - studded sword of bronze about his shoulders,"
100,2,262,"and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet,"
100,2,263,"well - wrought, with a crest of horse - hair that nodded menacingly"
100,2,264,"above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spear that suited his"
100,2,265,hands. In like fashion Menelaus also put on his armour.
100,2,266,"When they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode"
100,2,267,"fierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and"
100,2,268,Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood
100,2,269,"near one another on the measured ground, brandishing their"
100,2,270,"spears, and each furious against the other. Alexandrus aimed"
100,2,271,"first, and struck the round shield of the son of Atreus, but the"
100,2,272,"spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its point."
100,2,273,"Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as he did so."
100,2,274,"“King Jove,” he said, “grant me revenge on Alexandrus who has"
100,2,275,wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come a
100,2,276,man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of his host.”
100,2,277,"He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of"
100,2,278,"Alexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the"
100,2,279,"shirt by his flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved"
100,2,280,"his life. Then the son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the"
100,2,281,"projecting part of his helmet, but the sword fell shivered in"
100,2,282,"three or four pieces from his hand, and he cried, looking towards"
100,2,283,"Heaven, “Father Jove, of all gods thou art the most despiteful; I"
100,2,284,"made sure of my revenge, but the sword has broken in my hand, my"
100,2,285,"spear has been hurled in vain, and I have not killed him.”"
100,2,286,"With this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair"
100,2,287,"plume of his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans."
100,2,288,"The strap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him,"
100,2,289,and Menelaus would have dragged him off to his own great glory
100,2,290,had not Jove’s daughter Venus been quick to mark and to break the
100,2,291,"strap of oxhide, so that the empty helmet came away in his hand."
100,2,292,"This he flung to his comrades among the Achaeans, and was again"
100,2,293,"springing upon Alexandrus to run him through with a spear, but"
100,2,294,"Venus snatched him up in a moment (as a god can do), hid him"
100,2,295,"under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his own"
100,2,296,bedchamber.
100,2,297,"Then she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with"
100,2,298,the Trojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old
100,2,299,woman who used to dress wool for her when she was still in
100,2,300,"Lacedaemon, and of whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she"
100,2,301,"plucked her by perfumed robe and said, “Come hither; Alexandrus"
100,2,302,says you are to go to the house; he is on his bed in his own
100,2,303,"room, radiant with beauty and dressed in gorgeous apparel. No one"
100,2,304,"would think he had just come from fighting, but rather that he"
100,2,305,"was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was sitting down.”"
100,2,306,With these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she
100,2,307,"marked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and"
100,2,308,"sparkling eyes, she marvelled at her and said, “Goddess, why do"
100,2,309,you thus beguile me? Are you going to send me afield still
100,2,310,further to some man whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair
100,2,311,"Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished Alexandrus, and is to take"
100,2,312,my hateful self back with him. You are come here to betray me. Go
100,2,313,sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth be goddess no longer;
100,2,314,never let your feet carry you back to Olympus; worry about him
100,2,315,"and look after him till he make you his wife, or, for the matter"
100,2,316,"of that, his slave — but me? I shall not go; I can garnish his bed"
100,2,317,no longer; I should be a by - word among all the women of Troy.
100,2,318,"Besides, I have trouble on my mind.”"
100,2,319,"Venus was very angry, and said, “Bold hussy, do not provoke me;"
100,2,320,"if you do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as"
100,2,321,I have loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans
100,2,322,"and Achaeans, and you shall come to a bad end.”"
100,2,323,At this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her
100,2,324,"and went in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the"
100,2,325,Trojan women.
100,2,326,When they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid - servants set
100,2,327,"about their work, but Helen went into her own room, and the"
100,2,328,laughter - loving goddess took a seat and set it for her facing
100,2,329,"Alexandrus. On this Helen, daughter of aegis - bearing Jove, sat"
100,2,330,"down, and with eyes askance began to upbraid her husband."
100,2,331,"“So you are come from the fight,” said she; “would that you had"
100,2,332,fallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband.
100,2,333,You used to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear
100,2,334,"than Menelaus. Go, then, and challenge him again — but I should"
100,2,335,"advise you not to do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet"
100,2,336,"him in single combat, you will soon fall by his spear.”"
100,2,337,"And Paris answered, “Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches."
100,2,338,"This time, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me;"
100,2,339,"another time I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that"
100,2,340,"will stand by me. Come, let us lie down together and make"
100,2,341,friends. Never yet was I so passionately enamoured of you as at
100,2,342,this moment — not even when I first carried you off from Lacedaemon
100,2,343,and sailed away with you — not even when I had converse with you
100,2,344,upon the couch of love in the island of Cranae was I so
100,2,345,enthralled by desire of you as now.” On this he led her towards
100,2,346,"the bed, and his wife went with him."
100,2,347,Thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of
100,2,348,"Atreus strode among the throng, looking everywhere for"
100,2,349,"Alexandrus, and no man, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies,"
100,2,350,could find him. If they had seen him they were in no mind to hide
100,2,351,"him, for they all of them hated him as they did death itself."
100,2,352,"Then Agamemnon, king of men, spoke, saying, “Hear me, Trojans,"
100,2,353,"Dardanians, and allies. The victory has been with Menelaus;"
100,2,354,"therefore give back Helen with all her wealth, and pay such fine"
100,2,355,"as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shall be"
100,2,356,born hereafter.”
100,2,357,"Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in"
100,2,358,applause.
100,3,1,A quarrel in Olympus — Minerva goes down and persuades Fandarus to
100,3,2,violate the oaths by wounding Menelaus with an arrow — Agamemnon
100,3,3,makes a speech and sends for Machaon — He then goes about among his
100,3,4,"captains and upbraids Ulysses and Sthenelus, who each of them"
100,3,5,"retort fiercely — Diomed checks Sthenelus, and the two hosts then"
100,3,6,"engage, with great slaughter on either side."
100,3,7,Now the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden
100,3,8,"floor while Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink,"
100,3,9,and as they pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked
100,3,10,down upon the town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease
100,3,11,"Juno, talking at her so as to provoke her. “Menelaus,” said he,"
100,3,12,"“has two good friends among the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and"
100,3,13,"Minerva of Alalcomene, but they only sit still and look on, while"
100,3,14,Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus’ side to defend him in any danger;
100,3,15,indeed she has just rescued him when he made sure that it was all
100,3,16,over with him — for the victory really did lie with Menelaus. We
100,3,17,must consider what we shall do about all this; shall we set them
100,3,18,fighting anew or make peace between them? If you will agree to
100,3,19,this last Menelaus can take back Helen and the city of Priam may
100,3,20,remain still inhabited.”
100,3,21,Minerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by
100,3,22,side hatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her
100,3,23,"father, for she was in a furious passion with him, and said"
100,3,24,"nothing, but Juno could not contain herself. “Dread son of"
100,3,25,"Saturn,” said she, “what, pray, is the meaning of all this? Is my"
100,3,26,"trouble, then, to go for nothing, and the sweat that I have"
100,3,27,"sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while getting the people"
100,3,28,"together against Priam and his children? Do as you will, but we"
100,3,29,other gods shall not all of us approve your counsel.”
100,3,30,"Jove was angry and answered, “My dear, what harm have Priam and"
100,3,31,his sons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city
100,3,32,of Ilius? Will nothing do for you but you must within their walls
100,3,33,"and eat Priam raw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to"
100,3,34,boot? Have it your own way then; for I would not have this matter
100,3,35,"become a bone of contention between us. I say further, and lay my"
100,3,36,"saying to your heart, if ever I want to sack a city belonging to"
100,3,37,"friends of yours, you must not try to stop me; you will have to"
100,3,38,"let me do it, for I am giving in to you sorely against my will."
100,3,39,"Of all inhabited cities under the sun and stars of heaven, there"
100,3,40,was none that I so much respected as Ilius with Priam and his
100,3,41,"whole people. Equitable feasts were never wanting about my altar,"
100,3,42,"nor the savour of burning fat, which is honour due to ourselves.”"
100,3,43,"“My own three favourite cities,” answered Juno, “are Argos,"
100,3,44,"Sparta, and Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased"
100,3,45,with them. I shall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if
100,3,46,"I did, and tried to stay you, I should take nothing by it, for"
100,3,47,"you are much stronger than I am, but I will not have my own work"
100,3,48,wasted. I too am a god and of the same race with yourself. I am
100,3,49,"Saturn’s eldest daughter, and am honourable not on this ground"
100,3,50,"only, but also because I am your wife, and you are king over the"
100,3,51,"gods. Let it be a case, then, of give - and - take between us, and"
100,3,52,the rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Minerva to go and
100,3,53,"take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that the"
100,3,54,Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the
100,3,55,Achaeans.”
100,3,56,"The sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva,"
100,3,57,"“Go at once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that"
100,3,58,the Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon
100,3,59,the Achaeans.”
100,3,60,"This was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted"
100,3,61,from the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as
100,3,62,some brilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent
100,3,63,"as a sign to mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of"
100,3,64,light follows in its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck
100,3,65,"with awe as they beheld, and one would turn to his neighbour,"
100,3,66,"saying, “Either we shall again have war and din of combat, or"
100,3,67,Jove the lord of battle will now make peace between us.”
100,3,68,"Thus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus,"
100,3,69,"son of Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find"
100,3,70,"Pandarus, the redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing"
100,3,71,among the stalwart heroes who had followed him from the banks of
100,3,72,"the Aesopus, so she went close up to him and said, “Brave son of"
100,3,73,"Lycaon, will you do as I tell you? If you dare send an arrow at"
100,3,74,"Menelaus you will win honour and thanks from all the Trojans, and"
100,3,75,especially from prince Alexandrus — he would be the first to
100,3,76,requite you very handsomely if he could see Menelaus mount his
100,3,77,"funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your hand. Take your home"
100,3,78,"aim then, and pray to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer; vow that"
100,3,79,when you get home to your strong city of Zelea you will offer a
100,3,80,hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.”
100,3,81,"His fool’s heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its"
100,3,82,case. This bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he
100,3,83,"had killed as it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and"
100,3,84,it had fallen as the arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were
100,3,85,"sixteen palms long, and a worker in horn had made them into a"
100,3,86,"bow, smoothing them well down, and giving them tips of gold. When"
100,3,87,"Pandarus had strung his bow he laid it carefully on the ground,"
100,3,88,and his brave followers held their shields before him lest the
100,3,89,Achaeans should set upon him before he had shot Menelaus. Then he
100,3,90,opened the lid of his quiver and took out a winged arrow that had
100,3,91,"not yet been shot, fraught with the pangs of death. He laid the"
100,3,92,"arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian Apollo, the famous"
100,3,93,"archer, vowing that when he got home to his strong city of Zelea"
100,3,94,he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour. He
100,3,95,"laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drew"
100,3,96,both notch and string to his breast till the arrow - head was near
100,3,97,the bow; then when the bow was arched into a half - circle he let
100,3,98,"fly, and the bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew"
100,3,99,gladly on over the heads of the throng.
100,3,100,"But the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove’s"
100,3,101,"daughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee"
100,3,102,and ward off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a
100,3,103,mother whisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping
100,3,104,sweetly; she guided it to the part where the golden buckles of
100,3,105,"the belt that passed over his double cuirass were fastened, so"
100,3,106,the arrow struck the belt that went tightly round him. It went
100,3,107,right through this and through the cuirass of cunning
100,3,108,"workmanship; it also pierced the belt beneath it, which he wore"
100,3,109,next his skin to keep out darts or arrows; it was this that
100,3,110,"served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went through"
100,3,111,"it and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood began flowing"
100,3,112,from the wound.
100,3,113,As when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a
100,3,114,"piece of ivory that is to be the cheek - piece of a horse, and is"
100,3,115,to be laid up in a treasure house — many a knight is fain to bear
100,3,116,"it, but the king keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and"
100,3,117,"driver may be proud — even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs"
100,3,118,and your legs down to your fair ancles stained with blood.
100,3,119,When King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was
100,3,120,"afraid, and so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the"
100,3,121,barbs of the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow - head to
100,3,122,"the shaft were still outside the wound. Then he took heart, but"
100,3,123,Agamemnon heaved a deep sigh as he held Menelaus’s hand in his
100,3,124,"own, and his comrades made moan in concert. “Dear brother,” he"
100,3,125,"cried, “I have been the death of you in pledging this covenant"
100,3,126,and letting you come forward as our champion. The Trojans have
100,3,127,trampled on their oaths and have wounded you; nevertheless the
100,3,128,"oath, the blood of lambs, the drink - offerings and the right hands"
100,3,129,of fellowship in which we have put our trust shall not be vain.
100,3,130,"If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now, he will yet"
100,3,131,"fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their lives"
100,3,132,and with their wives and children. The day will surely come when
100,3,133,"mighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam’s people,"
100,3,134,when the son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them
100,3,135,with his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery.
100,3,136,"This shall surely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it"
100,3,137,"be your lot now to die? I should return to Argos as a by - word,"
100,3,138,for the Achaeans will at once go home. We shall leave Priam and
100,3,139,"the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, and the earth will"
100,3,140,rot your bones as you lie here at Troy with your purpose not
100,3,141,fulfilled. Then shall some braggart Trojan leap upon your tomb
100,3,142,"and say, ‘Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak his vengeance; he brought"
100,3,143,his army in vain; he is gone home to his own land with empty
100,3,144,"ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.’ Thus will one of them"
100,3,145,"say, and may the earth then swallow me.”"
100,3,146,"But Menelaus reassured him and said, “Take heart, and do not"
100,3,147,"alarm the people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part,"
100,3,148,"for my outer belt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under"
100,3,149,this my cuirass and the belt of mail which the bronze - smiths made
100,3,150,me.”
100,3,151,"And Agamemnon answered, “I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be"
100,3,152,"even so, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs"
100,3,153,upon it to relieve your pain.”
100,3,154,"He then said to Talthybius, “Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the"
100,3,155,"great physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus"
100,3,156,immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an
100,3,157,"arrow to our dismay, and to his own great glory.”"
100,3,158,"Talthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to"
100,3,159,find Machaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors
100,3,160,who had followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and
100,3,161,"said, “Son of Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come"
100,3,162,and see Menelaus immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has
100,3,163,wounded him with an arrow to our dismay and to his own great
100,3,164,glory.”
100,3,165,"Thus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed"
100,3,166,through the spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they
100,3,167,came to the place where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying
100,3,168,with the chieftains gathered in a circle round him. Machaon
100,3,169,passed into the middle of the ring and at once drew the arrow
100,3,170,"from the belt, bending its barbs back through the force with"
100,3,171,"which he pulled it out. He undid the burnished belt, and beneath"
100,3,172,this the cuirass and the belt of mail which the bronze - smiths had
100,3,173,"made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped away the blood"
100,3,174,and applied some soothing drugs which Chiron had given to
100,3,175,Aesculapius out of the good will he bore him.
100,3,176,"While they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came"
100,3,177,"forward against them, for they had put on their armour, and now"
100,3,178,renewed the fight.
100,3,179,You would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and
100,3,180,"unwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his"
100,3,181,chariot rich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of
100,3,182,"Eurymedon, son of Ptolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him"
100,3,183,hold them in readiness against the time his limbs should weary of
100,3,184,"going about and giving orders to so many, for he went among the"
100,3,185,ranks on foot. When he saw men hasting to the front he stood by
100,3,186,"them and cheered them on. “Argives,” said he, “slacken not one"
100,3,187,whit in your onset; father Jove will be no helper of liars; the
100,3,188,Trojans have been the first to break their oaths and to attack
100,3,189,us; therefore they shall be devoured of vultures; we shall take
100,3,190,their city and carry off their wives and children in our ships.”
100,3,191,But he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined
100,3,192,"to fight. “Argives,” he cried, “cowardly miserable creatures,"
100,3,193,"have you no shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when"
100,3,194,"they can no longer scud over the plain, huddle together, but show"
100,3,195,no fight? You are as dazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait
100,3,196,till the Trojans reach the sterns of our ships as they lie on the
100,3,197,"shore, to see whether the son of Saturn will hold his hand over"
100,3,198,you to protect you?”
100,3,199,Thus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing
100,3,200,"through the crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round"
100,3,201,"Idomeneus, who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while"
100,3,202,Meriones was bringing up the battalions that were in the rear.
100,3,203,"Agamemnon was glad when he saw him, and spoke him fairly."
100,3,204,"“Idomeneus,” said he, “I treat you with greater distinction than"
100,3,205,"I do any others of the Achaeans, whether in war or in other"
100,3,206,"things, or at table. When the princes are mixing my choicest"
100,3,207,"wines in the mixing - bowls, they have each of them a fixed"
100,3,208,"allowance, but your cup is kept always full like my own, that you"
100,3,209,"may drink whenever you are minded. Go, therefore, into battle,"
100,3,210,and show yourself the man you have been always proud to be.”
100,3,211,"Idomeneus answered, “I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised"
100,3,212,"you from the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that"
100,3,213,"we may join battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon"
100,3,214,"their covenants. Death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing"
100,3,215,they have been the first to break their oaths and to attack us.”
100,3,216,"The son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the"
100,3,217,two Ajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot - soldiers. As
100,3,218,when a goat - herd from some high post watches a storm drive over
100,3,219,the deep before the west wind — black as pitch is the offing and a
100,3,220,"mighty whirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and"
100,3,221,drives his flock into a cave — even thus did the ranks of stalwart
100,3,222,"youths move in a dark mass to battle under the Ajaxes, horrid"
100,3,223,with shield and spear. Glad was King Agamemnon when he saw them.
100,3,224,"“No need,” he cried, “to give orders to such leaders of the"
100,3,225,"Argives as you are, for of your own selves you spur your men on"
100,3,226,"to fight with might and main. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and"
100,3,227,"Apollo that all were so minded as you are, for the city of Priam"
100,3,228,"would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it.”"
100,3,229,"With this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile"
100,3,230,"speaker of the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging"
100,3,231,"them on, in company with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and"
100,3,232,Bias shepherd of his people. He placed his knights with their
100,3,233,"chariots and horses in the front rank, while the foot - soldiers,"
100,3,234,"brave men and many, whom he could trust, were in the rear. The"
100,3,235,"cowards he drove into the middle, that they might fight whether"
100,3,236,"they would or no. He gave his orders to the knights first,"
100,3,237,"bidding them hold their horses well in hand, so as to avoid"
100,3,238,"confusion. “Let no man,” he said, “relying on his strength or"
100,3,239,"horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with the"
100,3,240,"Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your"
100,3,241,attack; but let each when he meets an enemy’s chariot throw his
100,3,242,spear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men of
100,3,243,old took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they minded.”
100,3,244,"Thus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a"
100,3,245,"fight, and King Agamemnon was glad. “I wish,” he said to him,"
100,3,246,“that your limbs were as supple and your strength as sure as your
100,3,247,"judgment is; but age, the common enemy of mankind, has laid his"
100,3,248,"hand upon you; would that it had fallen upon some other, and that"
100,3,249,you were still young.”
100,3,250,"And Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, “Son of Atreus, I too"
100,3,251,would gladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but
100,3,252,the gods will not give us everything at one and the same time. I
100,3,253,"was then young, and now I am old; still I can go with my knights"
100,3,254,and give them that counsel which old men have a right to give.
100,3,255,The wielding of the spear I leave to those who are younger and
100,3,256,stronger than myself.”
100,3,257,"Agamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,"
100,3,258,"son of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the"
100,3,259,Athenians loud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning
100,3,260,"Ulysses, with his sturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not"
100,3,261,"yet heard the battle - cry, for the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans"
100,3,262,"had only just begun to move, so they were standing still, waiting"
100,3,263,for some other columns of the Achaeans to attack the Trojans and
100,3,264,begin the fighting. When he saw this Agamemnon rebuked them and
100,3,265,"said, “Son of Peteos, and you other, steeped in cunning, heart of"
100,3,266,"guile, why stand you here cowering and waiting on others? You two"
100,3,267,should be of all men foremost when there is hard fighting to be
100,3,268,"done, for you are ever foremost to accept my invitation when we"
100,3,269,councillors of the Achaeans are holding feast. You are glad
100,3,270,enough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink wine as
100,3,271,"long as you please, whereas now you would not care though you saw"
100,3,272,ten columns of Achaeans engage the enemy in front of you.”
100,3,273,"Ulysses glared at him and answered, “Son of Atreus, what are you"
100,3,274,talking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the
100,3,275,"Achaeans are in full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if"
100,3,276,"you care to do so, that the father of Telemachus will join battle"
100,3,277,with the foremost of them. You are talking idly.”
100,3,278,"When Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly"
100,3,279,"at him and withdrew his words. “Ulysses,” said he, “noble son of"
100,3,280,"Laertes, excellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to"
100,3,281,"find nor orders to give you, for I know your heart is right, and"
100,3,282,that you and I are of a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for
100,3,283,"what I have said, and if any ill has now been spoken may the gods"
100,3,284,bring it to nothing.”
100,3,285,He then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son
100,3,286,"of Tydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with"
100,3,287,Sthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to
100,3,288,"upbraid him. “Son of Tydeus,” he said, “why stand you cowering"
100,3,289,"here upon the brink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but"
100,3,290,was ever ahead of his men when leading them on against the
100,3,291,"foe — so, at least, say they that saw him in battle, for I never"
100,3,292,set eyes upon him myself. They say that there was no man like
100,3,293,"him. He came once to Mycenae, not as an enemy but as a guest, in"
100,3,294,"company with Polynices to recruit his forces, for they were"
100,3,295,"levying war against the strong city of Thebes, and prayed our"
100,3,296,people for a body of picked men to help them. The men of Mycenae
100,3,297,"were willing to let them have one, but Jove dissuaded them by"
100,3,298,"showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus, therefore, and Polynices"
100,3,299,went their way. When they had got as far the deep - meadowed and
100,3,300,"rush - grown banks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as"
100,3,301,"their envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered in great numbers"
100,3,302,"to a banquet in the house of Eteocles. Stranger though he was, he"
100,3,303,"knew no fear on finding himself single - handed among so many, but"
100,3,304,"challenged them to contests of all kinds, and in each one of them"
100,3,305,"was at once victorious, so mightily did Minerva help him. The"
100,3,306,"Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty"
100,3,307,"youths with two captains — the godlike hero Maeon, son of Haemon,"
100,3,308,"and Polyphontes, son of Autophonus — at their head, to lie in wait"
100,3,309,"for him on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every man of them,"
100,3,310,"save only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven’s omens."
100,3,311,"Such was Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he"
100,3,312,cannot fight as his father did.”
100,3,313,"Diomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of"
100,3,314,"Agamemnon; but the son of Capaneus took up his words and said,"
100,3,315,"“Son of Atreus, tell no lies, for you can speak truth if you"
100,3,316,will. We boast ourselves as even better men than our fathers; we
100,3,317,"took seven - gated Thebes, though the wall was stronger and our men"
100,3,318,"were fewer in number, for we trusted in the omens of the gods and"
100,3,319,"in the help of Jove, whereas they perished through their own"
100,3,320,"sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in like honour with us.”"
100,3,321,"Diomed looked sternly at him and said, “Hold your peace, my"
100,3,322,"friend, as I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge"
100,3,323,"the Achaeans forward, for the glory will be his if we take the"
100,3,324,"city, and his the shame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us"
100,3,325,acquit ourselves with valour.”
100,3,326,"As he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so"
100,3,327,fiercely about his body that even a brave man might well have
100,3,328,been scared to hear it.
100,3,329,As when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west
100,3,330,wind has lashed it into fury — it has reared its head afar and now
100,3,331,comes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high
100,3,332,over the jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all
100,3,333,directions — even so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march
100,3,334,steadfastly to battle. The chiefs gave orders each to his own
100,3,335,"people, but the men said never a word; no man would think it, for"
100,3,336,"huge as the host was, it seemed as though there was not a tongue"
100,3,337,"among them, so silent were they in their obedience; and as they"
100,3,338,marched the armour about their bodies glistened in the sun. But
100,3,339,the clamour of the Trojan ranks was as that of many thousand ewes
100,3,340,that stand waiting to be milked in the yards of some rich
100,3,341,"flockmaster, and bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating of"
100,3,342,"their lambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but their"
100,3,343,"tongues were diverse, and they came from many different places."
100,3,344,"These were inspired of Mars, but the others by Minerva — and with"
100,3,345,"them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister"
100,3,346,"and friend of murderous Mars, who, from being at first but low in"
100,3,347,"stature, grows till she uprears her head to heaven, though her"
100,3,348,feet are still on earth. She it was that went about among them
100,3,349,and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow with even hand
100,3,350,between them.
100,3,351,When they were got together in one place shield clashed with
100,3,352,shield and spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed
100,3,353,"shields beat one upon another, and there was a tramp as of a"
100,3,354,great multitude — death - cry and shout of triumph of slain and
100,3,355,"slayers, and the earth ran red with blood. As torrents swollen"
100,3,356,with rain course madly down their deep channels till the angry
100,3,357,"floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd on the hillside hears"
100,3,358,their roaring from afar — even such was the toil and uproar of the
100,3,359,hosts as they joined in battle.
100,3,360,"First Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,"
100,3,361,"son of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at"
100,3,362,the projecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his
100,3,363,"brow; the point of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled"
100,3,364,his eyes; headlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the
100,3,365,"fight, and as he dropped King Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and"
100,3,366,captain of the proud Abantes began dragging him out of reach of
100,3,367,"the darts that were falling around him, in haste to strip him of"
100,3,368,his armour. But his purpose was not for long; Agenor saw him
100,3,369,"haling the body away, and smote him in the side with his"
100,3,370,bronze - shod spear — for as he stooped his side was left unprotected
100,3,371,by his shield — and thus he perished. Then the fight between
100,3,372,"Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew"
100,3,373,"upon each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the"
100,3,374,other.
100,3,375,"Forthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius,"
100,3,376,"son of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the"
100,3,377,"Simois, as she was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been"
100,3,378,with her parents to see their flocks. Therefore he was named
100,3,379,"Simoeisius, but he did not live to pay his parents for his"
100,3,380,"rearing, for he was cut off untimely by the spear of mighty Ajax,"
100,3,381,who struck him in the breast by the right nipple as he was coming
100,3,382,on among the foremost fighters; the spear went right through his
100,3,383,"shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straight and"
100,3,384,"tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick with"
100,3,385,branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that he
100,3,386,"may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it"
100,3,387,lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell to
100,3,388,"earth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the"
100,3,389,"gleaming corslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid"
100,3,390,"the crowd and missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of"
100,3,391,"Ulysses, in the groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius"
100,3,392,over to the other side; so he fell upon the body and loosed his
100,3,393,"hold upon it. Ulysses was furious when he saw Leucus slain, and"
100,3,394,strode in full armour through the front ranks till he was quite
100,3,395,"close; then he glared round about him and took aim, and the"
100,3,396,"Trojans fell back as he did so. His dart was not sped in vain,"
100,3,397,"for it struck Democoon, the bastard son of Priam, who had come to"
100,3,398,"him from Abydos, where he had charge of his father’s mares."
100,3,399,"Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with his"
100,3,400,"spear on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the"
100,3,401,"other side of his forehead. Thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and"
100,3,402,his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the
100,3,403,"ground. Hector, and they that were in front, then gave round"
100,3,404,"while the Argives raised a shout and drew off the dead, pressing"
100,3,405,further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down from
100,3,406,"Pergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was displeased."
100,3,407,"“Trojans,” he cried, “rush on the foe, and do not let yourselves"
100,3,408,be thus beaten by the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor iron
100,3,409,"that when hit them you do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the"
100,3,410,"son of lovely Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger"
100,3,411,at the ships.”
100,3,412,"Thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while"
100,3,413,"Jove’s redoubtable daughter, the Trito - born, went about among the"
100,3,414,"host of the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld"
100,3,415,them slackening.
100,3,416,"Then fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck"
100,3,417,by a jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled
100,3,418,"it was Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who"
100,3,419,had come from Aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed
100,3,420,"by the pitiless stone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in"
100,3,421,his death throes stretched out his hands towards his comrades.
100,3,422,"But Peirous, who had wounded him, sprang on him and thrust a"
100,3,423,"spear into his belly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon"
100,3,424,"the ground, and darkness veiled his eyes. As he was leaving the"
100,3,425,"body, Thoas of Aetolia struck him in the chest near the nipple,"
100,3,426,and the point fixed itself in his lungs. Thoas came close up to
100,3,427,"him, pulled the spear out of his chest, and then drawing his"
100,3,428,"sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so that he died; but"
100,3,429,"he did not strip him of his armour, for his Thracian comrades,"
100,3,430,"men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads,"
100,3,431,stood round the body and kept him off with their long spears for
100,3,432,all his great stature and valour; so he was driven back. Thus the
100,3,433,"two corpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, the one"
100,3,434,captain of the Thracians and the other of the Epeans; and many
100,3,435,another fell round them.
100,3,436,And now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could
100,3,437,"have gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva"
100,3,438,"leading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of"
100,3,439,spears and arrows. For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay
100,3,440,stretched side by side face downwards upon the earth.
100,4,1,"The exploits of Diomed, who, though wounded by Pandarus,"
100,4,2,continues fighting — He kills Pandarus and wounds AEneas — Venus
100,4,3,"rescues AEneas, but being wounded by Diomed, commits him to the"
100,4,4,"care of Apollo and goes to Olympus, where she is tended by her"
100,4,5,"mother Dione — Mars encourages the Trojans, and AEneas returns to"
100,4,6,"the fight cured of his wound — Minerva and Juno help the Achaeans,"
100,4,7,"and by the advice of the former Diomed wounds Mars, who returns"
100,4,8,to Olympus to get cured.
100,4,9,"Then Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of"
100,4,10,"Tydeus, that he might excel all the other Argives, and cover"
100,4,11,himself with glory. She made a stream of fire flare from his
100,4,12,shield and helmet like the star that shines most brilliantly in
100,4,13,summer after its bath in the waters of Oceanus — even such a fire
100,4,14,did she kindle upon his head and shoulders as she bade him speed
100,4,15,into the thickest hurly - burly of the fight.
100,4,16,Now there was a certain rich and honourable man among the
100,4,17,"Trojans, priest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two"
100,4,18,"sons, Phegeus and Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of"
100,4,19,"war. These two came forward from the main body of Trojans, and"
100,4,20,"set upon Diomed, he being on foot, while they fought from their"
100,4,21,"chariot. When they were close up to one another, Phegeus took aim"
100,4,22,"first, but his spear went over Diomed’s left shoulder without"
100,4,23,"hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear sped not in vain,"
100,4,24,"for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and he fell"
100,4,25,from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother’s
100,4,26,"body, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight, or he would"
100,4,27,have shared his brother’s fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by
100,4,28,"wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old father might"
100,4,29,not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus
100,4,30,"drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take them to"
100,4,31,the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of
100,4,32,"Dares, one of them in fright and the other lying dead by his"
100,4,33,"chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by the hand and said,"
100,4,34,"“Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of cities, may we"
100,4,35,"not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out, and see"
100,4,36,to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go
100,4,37,"away, and thus avoid his anger.”"
100,4,38,"So saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon"
100,4,39,the steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the
100,4,40,"Trojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man."
100,4,41,"First King Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni,"
100,4,42,from his chariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad
100,4,43,"of his back, just as he was turning in flight; it struck him"
100,4,44,"between the shoulders and went right through his chest, and his"
100,4,45,armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
100,4,46,"Then Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had"
100,4,47,come from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right
100,4,48,"shoulder as he was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of"
100,4,49,death enshrouded him as he fell heavily from the car.
100,4,50,"The squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while"
100,4,51,"Menelaus, son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius,"
100,4,52,a mighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had
100,4,53,taught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred
100,4,54,"in mountain forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in"
100,4,55,"archery could now save him, for the spear of Menelaus struck him"
100,4,56,in the back as he was flying; it struck him between the shoulders
100,4,57,"and went right through his chest, so that he fell headlong and"
100,4,58,his armour rang rattling round him.
100,4,59,"Meriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son"
100,4,60,"of Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning"
100,4,61,"workmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was"
100,4,62,"that made the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of"
100,4,63,"all mischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on"
100,4,64,Alexandrus himself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven.
100,4,65,"Meriones overtook him as he was flying, and struck him on the"
100,4,66,right buttock. The point of the spear went through the bone into
100,4,67,"the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud and fell"
100,4,68,forward on his knees.
100,4,69,"Meges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was"
100,4,70,"a bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own"
100,4,71,"children, for the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus"
100,4,72,got close up to him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck:
100,4,73,"it went under his tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold"
100,4,74,"bronze, and fell dead in the dust."
100,4,75,"And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble"
100,4,76,"Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and"
100,4,77,was honoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus
100,4,78,"gave him chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his"
100,4,79,"sword upon the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The"
100,4,80,"bloody hand fell to the ground, and the shades of death, with"
100,4,81,"fate that no man can withstand, came over his eyes."
100,4,82,Thus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son
100,4,83,"of Tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the"
100,4,84,Achaeans or the Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter
100,4,85,"torrent that has burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no"
100,4,86,walls of fruitful vineyards can embank it when it is swollen with
100,4,87,"rain from heaven, but in a moment it comes tearing onward, and"
100,4,88,lays many a field waste that many a strong man’s hand has
100,4,89,reclaimed — even so were the dense phalanxes of the Trojans driven
100,4,90,"in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many though they were, they"
100,4,91,dared not abide his onslaught.
100,4,92,Now when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving
100,4,93,"the Trojans pell - mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the"
100,4,94,front part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right
100,4,95,"through the metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was"
100,4,96,"covered with blood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph,"
100,4,97,"“Knights Trojans, come on; the bravest of the Achaeans is"
100,4,98,"wounded, and he will not hold out much longer if King Apollo was"
100,4,99,indeed with me when I sped from Lycia hither.”
100,4,100,"Thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who"
100,4,101,"withdrew and made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the"
100,4,102,"son of Capaneus. “Dear son of Capaneus,” said he, “come down from"
100,4,103,"your chariot, and draw the arrow out of my shoulder.”"
100,4,104,"Sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the"
100,4,105,"wound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that"
100,4,106,"had been made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, “Hear me,"
100,4,107,"daughter of aegis - bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my"
100,4,108,"father well and stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like"
100,4,109,now by me; grant me to come within a spear’s throw of that man
100,4,110,and kill him. He has been too quick for me and has wounded me;
100,4,111,and now he is boasting that I shall not see the light of the sun
100,4,112,much longer.”
100,4,113,"Thus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs"
100,4,114,supple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up
100,4,115,"close to him and said, “Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the"
100,4,116,"Trojans, for I have set in your heart the spirit of your knightly"
100,4,117,"father Tydeus. Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your"
100,4,118,"eyes, that you know gods and men apart. If, then, any other god"
100,4,119,"comes here and offers you battle, do not fight him; but should"
100,4,120,"Jove’s daughter Venus come, strike her with your spear and wound"
100,4,121,her.”
100,4,122,"When she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus"
100,4,123,"again took his place among the foremost fighters, three times"
100,4,124,more fierce even than he had been before. He was like a lion that
100,4,125,"some mountain shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is"
100,4,126,springing over the wall of a sheep - yard to attack the sheep. The
100,4,127,shepherd has roused the brute to fury but cannot defend his
100,4,128,"flock, so he takes shelter under cover of the buildings, while"
100,4,129,"the sheep, panic - stricken on being deserted, are smothered in"
100,4,130,"heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps out over"
100,4,131,the sheep - yard wall. Even thus did Diomed go furiously about
100,4,132,among the Trojans.
100,4,133,"He killed Astynous, and Hypeiron shepherd of his people, the one"
100,4,134,"with a thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple,"
100,4,135,"the other with a sword - cut on the collar - bone, that severed his"
100,4,136,"shoulder from his neck and back. He let both of them lie, and"
100,4,137,"went in pursuit of Abas and Polyidus, sons of the old reader of"
100,4,138,dreams Eurydamas: they never came back for him to read them any
100,4,139,"more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an end of them. He then gave"
100,4,140,"chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of Phaenops, both of"
100,4,141,"them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with age, and"
100,4,142,begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took
100,4,143,"both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he"
100,4,144,"nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen"
100,4,145,divided his wealth among themselves.
100,4,146,"Then he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as"
100,4,147,they were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion
100,4,148,fastens on the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is
100,4,149,feeding in a coppice. For all their vain struggles he flung them
100,4,150,both from their chariot and stripped the armour from their
100,4,151,bodies. Then he gave their horses to his comrades to take them
100,4,152,back to the ships.
100,4,153,"When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went"
100,4,154,through the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find
100,4,155,"Pandarus. When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said,"
100,4,156,"“Pandarus, where is now your bow, your winged arrows, and your"
100,4,157,"renown as an archer, in respect of which no man here can rival"
100,4,158,you nor is there any in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then your
100,4,159,hands to Jove and send an arrow at this fellow who is going so
100,4,160,"masterfully about, and has done such deadly work among the"
100,4,161,Trojans. He has killed many a brave man — unless indeed he is some
100,4,162,"god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices, and and"
100,4,163,has set his hand against them in his displeasure.”
100,4,164,"And the son of Lycaon answered, “Aeneas, I take him for none"
100,4,165,"other than the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor"
100,4,166,"of his helmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a"
100,4,167,"god, but if he is the man I say he is, he is not making all this"
100,4,168,"havoc without heaven’s help, but has some god by his side who is"
100,4,169,"shrouded in a cloud of darkness, and who turned my arrow aside"
100,4,170,when it had hit him. I have taken aim at him already and hit him
100,4,171,on the right shoulder; my arrow went through the breastpiece of
100,4,172,his cuirass; and I made sure I should send him hurrying to the
100,4,173,"world below, but it seems that I have not killed him. There must"
100,4,174,be a god who is angry with me. Moreover I have neither horse nor
100,4,175,chariot. In my father’s stables there are eleven excellent
100,4,176,"chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths spread"
100,4,177,"over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses,"
100,4,178,champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again and
100,4,179,"again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take"
100,4,180,chariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in
100,4,181,"battle, but I would not listen to him; it would have been much"
100,4,182,"better if I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses,"
100,4,183,"which had been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in"
100,4,184,"such a great gathering of men they might be ill - fed, so I left"
100,4,185,them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only with my bow and
100,4,186,"arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have already hit two"
100,4,187,"chieftains, the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew"
100,4,188,"blood surely enough, I have only made them still more furious. I"
100,4,189,did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day I led my band
100,4,190,"of Trojans to Ilius in Hector’s service, and if ever I get home"
100,4,191,"again to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness"
100,4,192,"of my house, may some one cut my head off then and there if I do"
100,4,193,not break the bow and set it on a hot fire — such pranks as it
100,4,194,plays me.”
100,4,195,"Aeneas answered, “Say no more. Things will not mend till we two"
100,4,196,go against this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a
100,4,197,"trial of arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses"
100,4,198,of Tros can speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or
100,4,199,flight. If Jove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they
100,4,200,"will carry us safely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the"
100,4,201,"whip and reins while I stand upon the car to fight, or else do"
100,4,202,you wait this man’s onset while I look after the horses.”
100,4,203,"“Aeneas,” replied the son of Lycaon, “take the reins and drive;"
100,4,204,if we have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go
100,4,205,better for their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice
100,4,206,"when they expect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us"
100,4,207,out of the fight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and
100,4,208,take the horses. Therefore drive them yourself and I will be
100,4,209,ready for him with my spear.”
100,4,210,They then mounted the chariot and drove full - speed towards the
100,4,211,"son of Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and"
100,4,212,"said to Diomed, “Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I"
100,4,213,"see two heroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might"
100,4,214,"the one a skilful archer, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other,"
100,4,215,"Aeneas, whose sire is Anchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount"
100,4,216,"the chariot and let us retreat. Do not, I pray you, press so"
100,4,217,"furiously forward, or you may get killed.”"
100,4,218,"Diomed looked angrily at him and answered: “Talk not of flight,"
100,4,219,for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither
100,4,220,"flight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no"
100,4,221,"mind to mount, but will go against them even as I am; Pallas"
100,4,222,"Minerva bids me be afraid of no man, and even though one of them"
100,4,223,"escape, their steeds shall not take both back again. I say"
100,4,224,"further, and lay my saying to your heart — if Minerva sees fit to"
100,4,225,"vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your horses here and"
100,4,226,make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be sure you
100,4,227,spring Aeneas’ horses and drive them from the Trojan to the
100,4,228,Achaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros
100,4,229,"in payment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and"
100,4,230,move under the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his
100,4,231,"mares to them without Laomedon’s knowledge, and they bore him six"
100,4,232,"foals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the other two"
100,4,233,to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we can take them.”
100,4,234,"Thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up"
100,4,235,"to them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. “Great and mighty"
100,4,236,"son,” said he, “of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low,"
100,4,237,so I will now try with my spear.”
100,4,238,He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck
100,4,239,the shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and
100,4,240,passed on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of
100,4,241,"Lycaon shouted out and said, “You are hit clean through the"
100,4,242,"belly; you will not stand out for long, and the glory of the"
100,4,243,fight is mine.”
100,4,244,"But Diomed all undismayed made answer, “You have missed, not hit,"
100,4,245,and before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you
100,4,246,shall glut tough - shielded Mars with his blood.”
100,4,247,"With this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to"
100,4,248,Pandarus’s nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white
100,4,249,"teeth; the bronze point cut through the root of his tongue,"
100,4,250,"coming out under his chin, and his glistening armour rang"
100,4,251,rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. The horses
100,4,252,"started aside for fear, and he was reft of life and strength."
100,4,253,"Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear,"
100,4,254,fearing lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode
100,4,255,"it as a lion in the pride of strength, with shield and spear"
100,4,256,before him and a cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the
100,4,257,first that should dare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up
100,4,258,"a mighty stone, so huge and great that as men now are it would"
100,4,259,take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore it aloft with ease
100,4,260,"unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin where the"
100,4,261,hip turns in the joint that is called the “cup - bone.” The stone
100,4,262,"crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged"
100,4,263,"edges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and"
100,4,264,propped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the
100,4,265,"darkness of night fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of"
100,4,266,"men, would have perished then and there, had not his mother,"
100,4,267,"Jove’s daughter Venus, who had conceived him by Anchises when he"
100,4,268,"was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two white"
100,4,269,arms about the body of her dear son. She protected him by
100,4,270,"covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest some"
100,4,271,Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.
100,4,272,"Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the"
100,4,273,son of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had
100,4,274,"given him. He made his own horses fast, away from the"
100,4,275,"hurly - burly, by binding the reins to the rim of the chariot. Then"
100,4,276,he sprang upon Aeneas’s horses and drove them from the Trojan to
100,4,277,the Achaean ranks. When he had so done he gave them over to his
100,4,278,"chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued above all others as the"
100,4,279,"one who was most like - minded with himself, to take them on to the"
100,4,280,"ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and"
100,4,281,drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.
100,4,282,"Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess,"
100,4,283,"spear in hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those"
100,4,284,goddesses that can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or
100,4,285,"Enyo the waster of cities, and when at last after a long chase he"
100,4,286,"caught her up, he flew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh"
100,4,287,of her delicate hand. The point tore through the ambrosial robe
100,4,288,"which the Graces had woven for her, and pierced the skin between"
100,4,289,"her wrist and the palm of her hand, so that the immortal blood,"
100,4,290,"or ichor, that flows in the veins of the blessed gods, came"
100,4,291,pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat bread nor drink
100,4,292,"wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are immortal."
100,4,293,"Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus Apollo"
100,4,294,"caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest"
100,4,295,some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him;
100,4,296,"and Diomed shouted out as he left her, “Daughter of Jove, leave"
100,4,297,"war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling"
100,4,298,silly women? If you meddle with fighting you will get what will
100,4,299,make you shudder at the very name of war.”
100,4,300,"The goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as"
100,4,301,"the wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair"
100,4,302,skin all besmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of
100,4,303,"the battle, with his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a"
100,4,304,cloud; whereon she fell on her knees before her brother and
100,4,305,"implored him to let her have his horses. “Dear brother,” she"
100,4,306,"cried, “save me, and give me your horses to take me to Olympus"
100,4,307,"where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded by a mortal, the son of"
100,4,308,"Tydeus, who would now fight even with father Jove.”"
100,4,309,"Thus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold - bedizened steeds. She"
100,4,310,"mounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat"
100,4,311,beside her and took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses
100,4,312,"on and they flew forward nothing loth, till in a trice they were"
100,4,313,"at high Olympus, where the gods have their dwelling. There she"
100,4,314,"stayed them, unloosed them from the chariot, and gave them their"
100,4,315,ambrosial forage; but Venus flung herself on to the lap of her
100,4,316,"mother Dione, who threw her arms about her and caressed her,"
100,4,317,"saying, “Which of the heavenly beings has been treating you in"
100,4,318,"this way, as though you had been doing something wrong in the"
100,4,319,face of day?”
100,4,320,"And laughter - loving Venus answered, “Proud Diomed, the son of"
100,4,321,"Tydeus, wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom"
100,4,322,"I love best of all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no"
100,4,323,"longer one between Trojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now"
100,4,324,taken to fighting with the immortals.”
100,4,325,"“Bear it, my child,” replied Dione, “and make the best of it. We"
100,4,326,"dwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men,"
100,4,327,and we lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when
100,4,328,"Otus and Ephialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds,"
100,4,329,so that he lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze.
100,4,330,"Mars would have then perished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother"
100,4,331,"to the sons of Aloeus, told Mercury, who stole him away when he"
100,4,332,was already well - nigh worn out by the severity of his bondage.
100,4,333,"Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son of Amphitryon wounded"
100,4,334,"her on the right breast with a three - barbed arrow, and nothing"
100,4,335,"could assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same"
100,4,336,"man, the son of aegis - bearing Jove, hit him with an arrow even at"
100,4,337,"the gates of hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went to the"
100,4,338,"house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the"
100,4,339,arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon
100,4,340,"healed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for Hades"
100,4,341,"was not of mortal mould. Daring, head - strong, evildoer who recked"
100,4,342,not of his sin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And
100,4,343,"now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus on against yourself,"
100,4,344,fool that he is for not reflecting that no man who fights with
100,4,345,gods will live long or hear his children prattling about his
100,4,346,"knees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus"
100,4,347,see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than
100,4,348,"you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of"
100,4,349,"Adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss"
100,4,350,"of her wedded lord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.”"
100,4,351,"So saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter"
100,4,352,"with both hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was"
100,4,353,"healed. But Minerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt"
100,4,354,"Jove with their mocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak."
100,4,355,"“Father Jove,” said she, “do not be angry with me, but I think"
100,4,356,the Cyprian must have been persuading some one of the Achaean
100,4,357,"women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so very fond, and"
100,4,358,while caressing one or other of them she must have torn her
100,4,359,delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman’s brooch.”
100,4,360,"The sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his"
100,4,361,"side. “My child,” said he, “it has not been given you to be a"
100,4,362,"warrior. Attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial"
100,4,363,"duties, and leave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva.”"
100,4,364,"Thus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he"
100,4,365,knew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he
100,4,366,"fear the mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and"
100,4,367,stripping him of his armour. Thrice did he spring forward with
100,4,368,"might and main to slay him, and thrice did Apollo beat back his"
100,4,369,"gleaming shield. When he was coming on for the fourth time, as"
100,4,370,"though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice"
100,4,371,"and said, “Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off; think not to"
100,4,372,"match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth cannot"
100,4,373,hold their own with the immortals.”
100,4,374,"The son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the"
100,4,375,"anger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and"
100,4,376,"set him in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within"
100,4,377,"the mighty sanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him"
100,4,378,"glorious to behold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a"
100,4,379,"wraith in the likeness of Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this"
100,4,380,the Trojans and Achaeans hacked at the bucklers about one
100,4,381,"another’s breasts, hewing each other’s round shields and light"
100,4,382,"hide - covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to Mars, “Mars,"
100,4,383,"Mars, bane of men, blood - stained stormer of cities, can you not"
100,4,384,"go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with"
100,4,385,"father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went up to"
100,4,386,"the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and"
100,4,387,"afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god.”"
100,4,388,"He then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous"
100,4,389,"Mars went about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on,"
100,4,390,in the likeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. “Sons of
100,4,391,"Priam,” said he, “how long will you let your people be thus"
100,4,392,slaughtered by the Achaeans? Would you wait till they are at the
100,4,393,"walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we"
100,4,394,"held in as high honour as Hector himself. Help me, then, to"
100,4,395,rescue our brave comrade from the stress of the fight.”
100,4,396,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then
100,4,397,"Sarpedon rebuked Hector very sternly. “Hector,” said he, “where"
100,4,398,is your prowess now? You used to say that though you had neither
100,4,399,people nor allies you could hold the town alone with your
100,4,400,brothers and brothers - in - law. I see not one of them here; they
100,4,401,"cower as hounds before a lion; it is we, your allies, who bear"
100,4,402,"the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar, even from Lycia"
100,4,403,"and the banks of the river Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my"
100,4,404,"infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy;"
100,4,405,"nevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground"
100,4,406,against any who would fight me though I have nothing here for the
100,4,407,"Achaeans to plunder, while you look on, without even bidding your"
100,4,408,men stand firm in defence of their wives. See that you fall not
100,4,409,"into the hands of your foes as men caught in the meshes of a net,"
100,4,410,and they sack your fair city forthwith. Keep this before your
100,4,411,"mind night and day, and beseech the captains of your allies to"
100,4,412,"hold on without flinching, and thus put away their reproaches"
100,4,413,from you.”
100,4,414,"So spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang"
100,4,415,"from his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among"
100,4,416,"the host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight"
100,4,417,and raising the terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and
100,4,418,"again faced the Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm,"
100,4,419,and were not driven back. As the breezes sport with the chaff
100,4,420,"upon some goodly threshing - floor, when men are winnowing — while"
100,4,421,yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the chaff from the
100,4,422,"grain, and the chaff - heaps grow whiter and whiter — even so did the"
100,4,423,Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses’ hoofs raised to the
100,4,424,"firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to battle,"
100,4,425,"and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help"
100,4,426,"the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about"
100,4,427,"everywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him"
100,4,428,that when he saw Pallas Minerva leave the fray he was to put
100,4,429,courage into the hearts of the Trojans — for it was she who was
100,4,430,helping the Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich
100,4,431,"sanctuary, and filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his"
100,4,432,"place among his comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive,"
100,4,433,"sound, and of a good courage; but they could not ask him how it"
100,4,434,"had all happened, for they were too busy with the turmoil raised"
100,4,435,"by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in their midst."
100,4,436,"The two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on,"
100,4,437,fearless of the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as
100,4,438,still as clouds which the son of Saturn has spread upon the
100,4,439,mountain tops when there is no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with
100,4,440,the other boisterous winds whose shrill blasts scatter the clouds
100,4,441,in all directions — even so did the Danaans stand firm and
100,4,442,unflinching against the Trojans. The son of Atreus went about
100,4,443,"among them and exhorted them. “My friends,” said he, “quit"
100,4,444,"yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another’s"
100,4,445,eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour more
100,4,446,"often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life"
100,4,447,nor name.”
100,4,448,As he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in
100,4,449,"the front rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus,"
100,4,450,"whom the Trojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam,"
100,4,451,for he was ever quick to place himself among the foremost. The
100,4,452,spear of King Agamemnon struck his shield and went right through
100,4,453,"it, for the shield stayed it not. It drove through his belt into"
100,4,454,"the lower part of his belly, and his armour rang rattling round"
100,4,455,him as he fell heavily to the ground.
100,4,456,"Then Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and"
100,4,457,Orsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong
100,4,458,"city of Phere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose"
100,4,459,broad stream flows through the land of the Pylians. The river
100,4,460,"begat Orsilochus, who ruled over much people and was father to"
100,4,461,"Diocles, who in his turn begat twin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus,"
100,4,462,"well skilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew up,"
100,4,463,went to Ilius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and
100,4,464,"Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they both of them fell. As"
100,4,465,two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some
100,4,466,mountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and
100,4,467,"cattle till they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two"
100,4,468,"vanquished by Aeneas, and fell like high pine - trees to the"
100,4,469,ground.
100,4,470,"Brave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the"
100,4,471,"front, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for"
100,4,472,Mars egged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed
100,4,473,by Aeneas; but Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang
100,4,474,"forward, fearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring"
100,4,475,"all their labour to nothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus"
100,4,476,were setting their hands and spears against one another eager to
100,4,477,"do battle, Antilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus."
100,4,478,"Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back on seeing the two heroes"
100,4,479,"side by side in front of him, so they drew the bodies of Crethon"
100,4,480,and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans and committed the two
100,4,481,poor fellows into the hands of their comrades. They then turned
100,4,482,back and fought in the front ranks.
100,4,483,"They killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian"
100,4,484,warriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar - bone as he was
100,4,485,"standing on his chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and"
100,4,486,"squire Mydon, the son of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in"
100,4,487,"flight. He hit him with a stone upon the elbow, and the reins,"
100,4,488,"enriched with white ivory, fell from his hands into the dust."
100,4,489,Antilochus rushed towards him and struck him on the temples with
100,4,490,"his sword, whereon he fell head first from the chariot to the"
100,4,491,ground. There he stood for a while with his head and shoulders
100,4,492,buried deep in the dust — for he had fallen on sandy soil till his
100,4,493,"horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus"
100,4,494,lashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.
100,4,495,"But Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry"
100,4,496,"rushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the"
100,4,497,"Trojans. Mars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with"
100,4,498,"ruthless turmoil of battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear,"
100,4,499,"and went about, now in front of Hector and now behind him."
100,4,500,Diomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a
100,4,501,wide plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great
100,4,502,river rolling swiftly to the sea — he sees its boiling waters and
100,4,503,starts back in fear — even so did the son of Tydeus give ground.
100,4,504,"Then he said to his men, “My friends, how can we wonder that"
100,4,505,Hector wields the spear so well? Some god is ever by his side to
100,4,506,"protect him, and now Mars is with him in the likeness of mortal"
100,4,507,"man. Keep your faces therefore towards the Trojans, but give"
100,4,508,"ground backwards, for we dare not fight with gods.”"
100,4,509,"As he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,"
100,4,510,"both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed"
100,4,511,in war. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came
100,4,512,"close up and hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of"
100,4,513,"Selagus, a man of great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much"
100,4,514,"corn - growing land, but his lot had led him to come to the aid of"
100,4,515,Priam and his sons. Ajax struck him in the belt; the spear
100,4,516,"pierced the lower part of his belly, and he fell heavily to the"
100,4,517,"ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armour, but"
100,4,518,"the Trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his"
100,4,519,"shield. He planted his heel upon the body and drew out his spear,"
100,4,520,but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could not strip
100,4,521,"the goodly armour from his shoulders. The Trojan chieftains,"
100,4,522,"moreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so"
100,4,523,"that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was,"
100,4,524,they drove him from them and he was beaten back.
100,4,525,"Thus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the"
100,4,526,"strong hand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a"
100,4,527,"man both brave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the"
100,4,528,"two, son and grandson of great Jove, drew near to one another,"
100,4,529,"and Tlepolemus spoke first. “Sarpedon,” said he, “councillor of"
100,4,530,"the Lycians, why should you come skulking here you who are a man"
100,4,531,"of peace? They lie who call you son of aegis - bearing Jove, for"
100,4,532,you are little like those who were of old his children. Far other
100,4,533,"was Hercules, my own brave and lion - hearted father, who came here"
100,4,534,"for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships only, and"
100,4,535,"few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius and made a"
100,4,536,"wilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your people are"
100,4,537,"falling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming from"
100,4,538,"Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates"
100,4,539,of Hades vanquished by my hand.”
100,4,540,"And Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, “Tlepolemus, your"
100,4,541,father overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon’s folly in refusing
100,4,542,payment to one who had served him well. He would not give your
100,4,543,father the horses which he had come so far to fetch. As for
100,4,544,"yourself, you shall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory"
100,4,545,"to myself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds.”"
100,4,546,"Thus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They"
100,4,547,"threw at the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the"
100,4,548,"middle of his throat; the spear went right through, and the"
100,4,549,darkness of death fell upon his eyes. Tlepolemus’s spear struck
100,4,550,Sarpedon on the left thigh with such force that it tore through
100,4,551,"the flesh and grazed the bone, but his father as yet warded off"
100,4,552,destruction from him.
100,4,553,"His comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the"
100,4,554,weight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were
100,4,555,in such haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of
100,4,556,drawing the spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly.
100,4,557,"Meanwhile the Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus,"
100,4,558,"whereon Ulysses was moved to pity, and panted for the fray as he"
100,4,559,"beheld them. He doubted whether to pursue the son of Jove, or to"
100,4,560,"make slaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was not decreed,"
100,4,561,"however, that he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, therefore,"
100,4,562,turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He killed
100,4,563,"Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and"
100,4,564,"Prytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great Hector"
100,4,565,"marked him, and sped to the front of the fight clad in his suit"
100,4,566,"of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad when"
100,4,567,"he saw him coming, and besought him, saying, “Son of Priam, let"
100,4,568,"me not be here to fall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me,"
100,4,569,and since I may not return home to gladden the hearts of my wife
100,4,570,"and of my infant son, let me die within the walls of your city.”"
100,4,571,"Hector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon"
100,4,572,the Achaeans and kill many among them. His comrades then bore
100,4,573,Sarpedon away and laid him beneath Jove’s spreading oak tree.
100,4,574,"Pelagon, his friend and comrade, drew the spear out of his thigh,"
100,4,575,but Sarpedon fainted and a mist came over his eyes. Presently he
100,4,576,"came to himself again, for the breath of the north wind as it"
100,4,577,"played upon him gave him new life, and brought him out of the"
100,4,578,deep swoon into which he had fallen.
100,4,579,Meanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by
100,4,580,"Mars and Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew"
100,4,581,"that Mars was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their"
100,4,582,"faces still turned towards the foe. Who, then, was first and who"
100,4,583,"last to be slain by Mars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras,"
100,4,584,"and Orestes the renowned charioteer, Trechus the Aetolian"
100,4,585,"warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of Oenops, and Oresbius of the"
100,4,586,"gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by"
100,4,587,"the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who lived near him,"
100,4,588,owners of a fertile country.
100,4,589,"Now when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said"
100,4,590,"to Minerva, “Alas, daughter of aegis - bearing Jove, unweariable,"
100,4,591,the promise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he
100,4,592,had sacked the city of Ilius will be of no effect if we let Mars
100,4,593,rage thus furiously. Let us go into the fray at once.”
100,4,594,"Minerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter"
100,4,595,"of great Saturn, began to harness her gold - bedizened steeds. Hebe"
100,4,596,with all speed fitted on the eight - spoked wheels of bronze that
100,4,597,were on either side of the iron axle - tree. The felloes of the
100,4,598,"wheels were of gold, imperishable, and over these there was a"
100,4,599,"tire of bronze, wondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were"
100,4,600,"silver, turning round the axle upon either side. The car itself"
100,4,601,"was made with plaited bands of gold and silver, and it had a"
100,4,602,double top - rail running all round it. From the body of the car
100,4,603,"there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which she bound the"
100,4,604,"golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were to go under the"
100,4,605,"necks of the horses. Then Juno put her steeds under the yoke,"
100,4,606,eager for battle and the war - cry.
100,4,607,"Meanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with"
100,4,608,"her own hands, on to her father’s threshold, and donned the shirt"
100,4,609,"of Jove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis"
100,4,610,"about her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe,"
100,4,611,"and on it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs"
100,4,612,"cold; moreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,"
100,4,613,"grim and awful to behold, portent of aegis - bearing Jove. On her"
100,4,614,"head she set her helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to"
100,4,615,a peak both in front and behind — decked with the emblems of a
100,4,616,hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming chariot and
100,4,617,"grasped the spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, with which she"
100,4,618,quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed
100,4,619,"the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open"
100,4,620,"of their own accord — gates over which the Hours preside, in whose"
100,4,621,"hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that"
100,4,622,"hides them, or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove"
100,4,623,"their obedient steeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all"
100,4,624,alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed her
100,4,625,"horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn, lord of all. “Father"
100,4,626,"Jove,” said she, “are you not angry with Mars for these high"
100,4,627,doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has
100,4,628,"destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason,"
100,4,629,while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease
100,4,630,and setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I
100,4,631,"hope, Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard,"
100,4,632,and chase him out of the battle.”
100,4,633,"And Jove answered, “Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him"
100,4,634,more often than any one else does.”
100,4,635,"Juno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew"
100,4,636,forward nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a
100,4,637,"man can see when he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon,"
100,4,638,so far can the loud - neighing horses of the gods spring at a
100,4,639,single bound. When they reached Troy and the place where its two
100,4,640,"flowing streams Simois and Scamander meet, there Juno stayed them"
100,4,641,"and took them from the chariot. She hid them in a thick cloud,"
100,4,642,and Simois made ambrosia spring up for them to eat; the two
100,4,643,"goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves in their"
100,4,644,eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part where
100,4,645,"the bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed,"
100,4,646,fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and
100,4,647,"endurance, there Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of"
100,4,648,"brazen - voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men"
100,4,649,"together. “Argives,” she cried; “shame on cowardly creatures,"
100,4,650,"brave in semblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, if his"
100,4,651,spear was so deadly that the Trojans dared not show themselves
100,4,652,"outside the Dardanian gates, but now they sally far from the city"
100,4,653,and fight even at your ships.”
100,4,654,"With these words she put heart and soul into them all, while"
100,4,655,"Minerva sprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found"
100,4,656,"near his chariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had"
100,4,657,given him. For the sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight
100,4,658,"of his shield irritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain,"
100,4,659,and he was lifting up the strap to wipe away the blood. The
100,4,660,"goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his horses and said, “The"
100,4,661,son of Tydeus is not such another as his father. Tydeus was a
100,4,662,"little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into the fray"
100,4,663,even when I told him not to do so. When he went all unattended as
100,4,664,"envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade him feast"
100,4,665,in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit which
100,4,666,"was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the"
100,4,667,"Cadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so"
100,4,668,"mightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I"
100,4,669,bid you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are
100,4,670,"tired out, or you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I"
100,4,671,say that you are no true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.”
100,4,672,"Diomed answered, “I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis - bearing"
100,4,673,"Jove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of"
100,4,674,"heart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your"
100,4,675,own instructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed
100,4,676,gods; but if Jove’s daughter Venus came into battle I was to
100,4,677,"wound her with my spear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding"
100,4,678,"the other Argives gather in this place, for I know that Mars is"
100,4,679,now lording it in the field.”
100,4,680,"“Diomed, son of Tydeus,” replied Minerva, “man after my own"
100,4,681,"heart, fear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I"
100,4,682,"will befriend you. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in"
100,4,683,"close combat; fear not this raging madman, villain incarnate,"
100,4,684,first on one side and then on the other. But now he was holding
100,4,685,"talk with Juno and myself, saying he would help the Argives and"
100,4,686,"attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has"
100,4,687,forgotten the Argives.”
100,4,688,With this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the
100,4,689,"chariot on to the ground. In a second he was on the ground,"
100,4,690,whereupon the goddess mounted the car and placed herself by the
100,4,691,side of Diomed. The oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of
100,4,692,the awful goddess and the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and
100,4,693,"reins, and drove straight at Mars. He was in the act of stripping"
100,4,694,"huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the Aetolians."
100,4,695,"Bloody Mars was stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned"
100,4,696,"the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her; when, therefore,"
100,4,697,"he saw Diomed, he made straight for him and let Periphas lie"
100,4,698,where he had fallen. As soon as they were at close quarters he
100,4,699,"let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke, thinking"
100,4,700,"to take Diomed’s life, but Minerva caught the spear in her hand"
100,4,701,"and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then threw,"
100,4,702,and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars’s stomach
100,4,703,"where his under - girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him,"
100,4,704,tearing his fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars
100,4,705,roared as loudly as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a
100,4,706,"fight, and the Achaeans and Trojans were struck with panic, so"
100,4,707,terrible was the cry he raised.
100,4,708,"As a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat,"
100,4,709,even so did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad
100,4,710,"heavens. With all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the"
100,4,711,"gods, and in great pain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn."
100,4,712,He showed Jove the immortal blood that was flowing from his
100,4,713,"wound, and spoke piteously, saying, “Father Jove, are you not"
100,4,714,angered by such doings? We gods are continually suffering in the
100,4,715,most cruel manner at one another’s hands while helping mortals;
100,4,716,and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad
100,4,717,"termagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of some"
100,4,718,"kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you"
100,4,719,neither scold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent
100,4,720,creature is your daughter. See how she has been inciting proud
100,4,721,Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went up to
100,4,722,"the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then"
100,4,723,he sprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not run for
100,4,724,it I must either have lain there for long enough in torments
100,4,725,"among the ghastly corpses, or have been eaten alive with spears"
100,4,726,till I had no more strength left in me.”
100,4,727,"Jove looked angrily at him and said, “Do not come whining here,"
100,4,728,Sir Facing - both - ways. I hate you worst of all the gods in
100,4,729,"Olympus, for you are ever fighting and making mischief. You have"
100,4,730,the intolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is
100,4,731,"all I can do to manage her, and it is her doing that you are now"
100,4,732,"in this plight: still, I cannot let you remain longer in such"
100,4,733,"great pain; you are my own offspring, and it was by me that your"
100,4,734,"mother conceived you; if, however, you had been the son of any"
100,4,735,"other god, you are so destructive that by this time you should"
100,4,736,have been lying lower than the Titans.”
100,4,737,"He then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain - killing"
100,4,738,"herbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal"
100,4,739,"mould. As the juice of the fig - tree curdles milk, and thickens it"
100,4,740,"in a moment though it is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon"
100,4,741,"cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly"
100,4,742,"raiment, and he took his seat by his father Jove all glorious to"
100,4,743,behold.
100,4,744,"But Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had"
100,4,745,"put a stop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to"
100,4,746,the house of Jove.
100,5,1,Glaucus and Diomed — The story of Bellerophon — Hector and
100,5,2,Andromache.
100,5,3,The fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it
100,5,4,"would, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the"
100,5,5,plain as they aimed their bronze - shod spears at one another
100,5,6,between the streams of Simois and Xanthus.
100,5,7,"First, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans,"
100,5,8,"broke a phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his"
100,5,9,"comrades by killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among"
100,5,10,"the Thracians, being both brave and of great stature. The spear"
100,5,11,struck the projecting peak of his helmet: its bronze point then
100,5,12,"went through his forehead into the brain, and darkness veiled his"
100,5,13,eyes.
100,5,14,"Then Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived"
100,5,15,"in the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he"
100,5,16,"had a house by the roadside, and entertained every one who"
100,5,17,passed; howbeit not one of his guests stood before him to save
100,5,18,"his life, and Diomed killed both him and his squire Calesius, who"
100,5,19,was then his charioteer — so the pair passed beneath the earth.
100,5,20,"Euryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of"
100,5,21,"Aesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to"
100,5,22,"noble Bucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a"
100,5,23,"bastard. While tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph,"
100,5,24,"and she conceived twin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew,"
100,5,25,and he stripped the armour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then
100,5,26,"killed Astyalus, Ulysses Pidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon."
100,5,27,"Ablerus fell by the spear of Nestor’s son Antilochus, and"
100,5,28,"Agamemnon, king of men, killed Elatus who dwelt in Pedasus by the"
100,5,29,banks of the river Satnioeis. Leitus killed Phylacus as he was
100,5,30,"flying, and Eurypylus slew Melanthus."
100,5,31,"Then Menelaus of the loud war - cry took Adrestus alive, for his"
100,5,32,"horses ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over"
100,5,33,"the plain, and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards"
100,5,34,"the city along with the others in full flight, but Adrestus"
100,5,35,"rolled out, and fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of"
100,5,36,"his chariot; Menelaus came up to him spear in hand, but Adrestus"
100,5,37,"caught him by the knees begging for his life. “Take me alive,” he"
100,5,38,"cried, “son of Atreus, and you shall have a full ransom for me:"
100,5,39,"my father is rich and has much treasure of gold, bronze, and"
100,5,40,wrought iron laid by in his house. From this store he will give
100,5,41,you a large ransom should he hear of my being alive and at the
100,5,42,ships of the Achaeans.”
100,5,43,"Thus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him"
100,5,44,"to a squire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon"
100,5,45,"came running up to him and rebuked him. “My good Menelaus,” said"
100,5,46,"he, “this is no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house"
100,5,47,fared so well at the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a
100,5,48,single one of them — not even the child unborn and in its mother’s
100,5,49,"womb; let not a man of them be left alive, but let all in Ilius"
100,5,50,"perish, unheeded and forgotten.”"
100,5,51,"Thus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his"
100,5,52,"words were just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him,"
100,5,53,"whereon King Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then"
100,5,54,the son of Atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his
100,5,55,spear from the body.
100,5,56,"Meanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, “My friends,"
100,5,57,"Danaan warriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may"
100,5,58,"spoil the dead, and bring back much booty to the ships. Let us"
100,5,59,"kill as many as we can; the bodies will lie upon the plain, and"
100,5,60,you can despoil them later at your leisure.”
100,5,61,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the
100,5,62,"Trojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had"
100,5,63,"not Priam’s son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and"
100,5,64,"Aeneas, “Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the"
100,5,65,"Trojans and Lycians, for you are foremost at all times, alike in"
100,5,66,"fight and counsel; hold your ground here, and go about among the"
100,5,67,"host to rally them in front of the gates, or they will fling"
100,5,68,"themselves into the arms of their wives, to the great joy of our"
100,5,69,"foes. Then, when you have put heart into all our companies, we"
100,5,70,will stand firm here and fight the Danaans however hard they
100,5,71,"press us, for there is nothing else to be done. Meanwhile do you,"
100,5,72,"Hector, go to the city and tell our mother what is happening."
100,5,73,Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the temple of Minerva in
100,5,74,the acropolis; let her then take her key and open the doors of
100,5,75,"the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva, let her"
100,5,76,"lay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house — the one she"
100,5,77,"sets most store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice"
100,5,78,"twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the"
100,5,79,"temple of the goddess, if she will take pity on the town, with"
100,5,80,"the wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of"
100,5,81,Tydeus from falling on the goodly city of Ilius; for he fights
100,5,82,with fury and fills men’s souls with panic. I hold him mightiest
100,5,83,"of them all; we did not fear even their great champion Achilles,"
100,5,84,"son of a goddess though he be, as we do this man: his rage is"
100,5,85,"beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with him in"
100,5,86,prowess.”
100,5,87,"Hector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot,"
100,5,88,"and went about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears,"
100,5,89,"urging the men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle."
100,5,90,"Thereon they rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave"
100,5,91,"ground and ceased their murderous onset, for they deemed that"
100,5,92,some one of the immortals had come down from starry heaven to
100,5,93,"help the Trojans, so strangely had they rallied. And Hector"
100,5,94,"shouted to the Trojans, “Trojans and allies, be men, my friends,"
100,5,95,"and fight with might and main, while I go to Ilius and tell the"
100,5,96,old men of our council and our wives to pray to the gods and vow
100,5,97,hecatombs in their honour.”
100,5,98,"With this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went"
100,5,99,round his shield beat against his neck and his ancles.
100,5,100,"Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into"
100,5,101,the open space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When
100,5,102,they were close up to one another Diomed of the loud war - cry was
100,5,103,"the first to speak. “Who, my good sir,” said he, “who are you"
100,5,104,"among men? I have never seen you in battle until now, but you are"
100,5,105,daring beyond all others if you abide my onset. Woe to those
100,5,106,"fathers whose sons face my might. If, however, you are one of the"
100,5,107,"immortals and have come down from heaven, I will not fight you;"
100,5,108,"for even valiant Lycurgus, son of Dryas, did not live long when"
100,5,109,he took to fighting with the gods. He it was that drove the
100,5,110,nursing women who were in charge of frenzied Bacchus through the
100,5,111,"land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on the ground as"
100,5,112,murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus himself
100,5,113,"plunged terror - stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him to her"
100,5,114,"bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which"
100,5,115,the man reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry
100,5,116,"with Lycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he"
100,5,117,live much longer after he had become hateful to the immortals.
100,5,118,Therefore I will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are
100,5,119,"of them that eat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your"
100,5,120,doom.”
100,5,121,"And the son of Hippolochus answered, “Son of Tydeus, why ask me"
100,5,122,of my lineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the
100,5,123,"trees. Those of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when"
100,5,124,spring returns the forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is
100,5,125,"it with the generations of mankind, the new spring up as the old"
100,5,126,"are passing away. If, then, you would learn my descent, it is one"
100,5,127,that is well known to many. There is a city in the heart of
100,5,128,"Argos, pasture land of horses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus"
100,5,129,"lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind. He was the son of"
100,5,130,"Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus, who was father to"
100,5,131,"Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing"
100,5,132,"comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and being"
100,5,133,"stronger than he, drove him from the land of the Argives, over"
100,5,134,"which Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted"
100,5,135,"after him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; but"
100,5,136,"Bellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told lies"
100,5,137,"about him to Proeteus. ‘Proetus,’ said she, ‘kill Bellerophon or"
100,5,138,"die, for he would have had converse with me against my will.’ The"
100,5,139,"king was angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent"
100,5,140,"him to Lycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a"
100,5,141,"folded tablet, and containing much ill against the bearer. He"
100,5,142,"bade Bellerophon show these letters to his father - in - law, to the"
100,5,143,end that he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to
100,5,144,"Lycia, and the gods convoyed him safely."
100,5,145,"“When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king"
100,5,146,"received him with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed"
100,5,147,"nine heifers in his honour, but when rosy - fingered morning"
100,5,148,"appeared upon the tenth day, he questioned him and desired to see"
100,5,149,the letter from his son - in - law Proetus. When he had received the
100,5,150,wicked letter he first commanded Bellerophon to kill that savage
100,5,151,"monster, the Chimaera, who was not a human being, but a goddess,"
100,5,152,"for she had the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent, while"
100,5,153,"her body was that of a goat, and she breathed forth flames of"
100,5,154,"fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he was guided by signs from"
100,5,155,"heaven. He next fought the far - famed Solymi, and this, he said,"
100,5,156,"was the hardest of all his battles. Thirdly, he killed the"
100,5,157,"Amazons, women who were the peers of men, and as he was returning"
100,5,158,thence the king devised yet another plan for his destruction; he
100,5,159,"picked the bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed them in"
100,5,160,"ambuscade, but not a man ever came back, for Bellerophon killed"
100,5,161,every one of them. Then the king knew that he must be the valiant
100,5,162,"offspring of a god, so he kept him in Lycia, gave him his"
100,5,163,"daughter in marriage, and made him of equal honour in the kingdom"
100,5,164,"with himself; and the Lycians gave him a piece of land, the best"
100,5,165,"in all the country, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to"
100,5,166,have and to hold.
100,5,167,"“The king’s daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander,"
100,5,168,"Hippolochus, and Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay with"
100,5,169,"Laodameia, and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon"
100,5,170,"came to be hated by all the gods, he wandered all desolate and"
100,5,171,"dismayed upon the Alean plain, gnawing at his own heart, and"
100,5,172,"shunning the path of man. Mars, insatiate of battle, killed his"
100,5,173,son Isander while he was fighting the Solymi; his daughter was
100,5,174,"killed by Diana of the golden reins, for she was angered with"
100,5,175,"her; but Hippolochus was father to myself, and when he sent me to"
100,5,176,Troy he urged me again and again to fight ever among the foremost
100,5,177,"and outvie my peers, so as not to shame the blood of my fathers"
100,5,178,"who were the noblest in Ephyra and in all Lycia. This, then, is"
100,5,179,the descent I claim.”
100,5,180,"Thus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted"
100,5,181,"his spear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words."
100,5,182,"“Then,” he said, “you are an old friend of my father’s house."
100,5,183,"Great Oeneus once entertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and"
100,5,184,"the two exchanged presents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple,"
100,5,185,"and Bellerophon a double cup, which I left at home when I set out"
100,5,186,"for Troy. I do not remember Tydeus, for he was taken from us"
100,5,187,"while I was yet a child, when the army of the Achaeans was cut to"
100,5,188,"pieces before Thebes. Henceforth, however, I must be your host in"
100,5,189,"middle Argos, and you mine in Lycia, if I should ever go there;"
100,5,190,let us avoid one another’s spears even during a general
100,5,191,engagement; there are many noble Trojans and allies whom I can
100,5,192,"kill, if I overtake them and heaven delivers them into my hand;"
100,5,193,"so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whose lives you"
100,5,194,"may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour, that all"
100,5,195,present may know of the old ties that subsist between us.”
100,5,196,"With these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one"
100,5,197,"another’s hands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn"
100,5,198,"made Glaucus take leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden"
100,5,199,"armour for bronze, the worth of a hundred head of cattle for the"
100,5,200,worth of nine.
100,5,201,"Now when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the"
100,5,202,wives and daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to
100,5,203,"ask after their sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told"
100,5,204,"them to set about praying to the gods, and many were made"
100,5,205,sorrowful as they heard him.
100,5,206,"Presently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned"
100,5,207,with colonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty
100,5,208,"bedchambers — all of hewn stone — built near one another, where the"
100,5,209,"sons of Priam slept, each with his wedded wife. Opposite these,"
100,5,210,"on the other side the courtyard, there were twelve upper rooms"
100,5,211,"also of hewn stone for Priam’s daughters, built near one another,"
100,5,212,where his sons - in - law slept with their wives. When Hector got
100,5,213,"there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodice the fairest of"
100,5,214,"her daughters. She took his hand within her own and said, “My"
100,5,215,"son, why have you left the battle to come hither? Are the"
100,5,216,"Achaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about the city that"
100,5,217,you have thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jove from
100,5,218,the citadel? Wait till I can bring you wine that you may make
100,5,219,"offering to Jove and to the other immortals, and may then drink"
100,5,220,and be refreshed. Wine gives a man fresh strength when he is
100,5,221,"wearied, as you now are with fighting on behalf of your kinsmen.”"
100,5,222,"And Hector answered, “Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you"
100,5,223,unman me and I forget my strength. I dare not make a
100,5,224,drink - offering to Jove with unwashed hands; one who is
100,5,225,bespattered with blood and filth may not pray to the son of
100,5,226,"Saturn. Get the matrons together, and go with offerings to the"
100,5,227,"temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there, upon the knees of"
100,5,228,"Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in your"
100,5,229,"house — the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to"
100,5,230,sacrifice twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the
100,5,231,"goad, in the temple of the goddess if she will take pity on the"
100,5,232,"town, with the wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the"
100,5,233,"son of Tydeus from off the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights"
100,5,234,"with fury, and fills men’s souls with panic. Go, then, to the"
100,5,235,"temple of Minerva, while I seek Paris and exhort him, if he will"
100,5,236,hear my words. Would that the earth might open her jaws and
100,5,237,"swallow him, for Jove bred him to be the bane of the Trojans, and"
100,5,238,of Priam and Priam’s sons. Could I but see him go down into the
100,5,239,"house of Hades, my heart would forget its heaviness.”"
100,5,240,His mother went into the house and called her waiting - women who
100,5,241,gathered the matrons throughout the city. She then went down into
100,5,242,"her fragrant store - room, where her embroidered robes were kept,"
100,5,243,"the work of Sidonian women, whom Alexandrus had brought over from"
100,5,244,Sidon when he sailed the seas upon that voyage during which he
100,5,245,"carried off Helen. Hecuba took out the largest robe, and the one"
100,5,246,"that was most beautifully enriched with embroidery, as an"
100,5,247,"offering to Minerva: it glittered like a star, and lay at the"
100,5,248,very bottom of the chest. With this she went on her way and many
100,5,249,matrons with her.
100,5,250,"When they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter"
100,5,251,"of Cisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojans"
100,5,252,had made her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their
100,5,253,"hands to the goddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to"
100,5,254,"lay it upon the knees of Minerva, praying the while to the"
100,5,255,"daughter of great Jove. “Holy Minerva,” she cried, “protectress"
100,5,256,"of our city, mighty goddess, break the spear of Diomed and lay"
100,5,257,"him low before the Scaean gates. Do this, and we will sacrifice"
100,5,258,"twelve heifers that have never yet known the goad, in your"
100,5,259,"temple, if you will have pity upon the town, with the wives and"
100,5,260,"little ones of the Trojans.” Thus she prayed, but Pallas Minerva"
100,5,261,granted not her prayer.
100,5,262,"While they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove,"
100,5,263,"Hector went to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built"
100,5,264,for him by the foremost builders in the land. They had built him
100,5,265,"his house, storehouse, and courtyard near those of Priam and"
100,5,266,"Hector on the acropolis. Here Hector entered, with a spear eleven"
100,5,267,cubits long in his hand; the bronze point gleamed in front of
100,5,268,"him, and was fastened to the shaft of the spear by a ring of"
100,5,269,"gold. He found Alexandrus within the house, busied about his"
100,5,270,"armour, his shield and cuirass, and handling his curved bow;"
100,5,271,"there, too, sat Argive Helen with her women, setting them their"
100,5,272,several tasks; and as Hector saw him he rebuked him with words of
100,5,273,"scorn. “Sir,” said he, “you do ill to nurse this rancour; the"
100,5,274,people perish fighting round this our town; you would yourself
100,5,275,"chide one whom you saw shirking his part in the combat. Up then,"
100,5,276,or ere long the city will be in a blaze.”
100,5,277,"And Alexandrus answered, “Hector, your rebuke is just; listen"
100,5,278,"therefore, and believe me when I tell you that I am not here so"
100,5,279,"much through rancour or ill - will towards the Trojans, as from a"
100,5,280,desire to indulge my grief. My wife was even now gently urging me
100,5,281,"to battle, and I hold it better that I should go, for victory is"
100,5,282,"ever fickle. Wait, then, while I put on my armour, or go first"
100,5,283,and I will follow. I shall be sure to overtake you.”
100,5,284,"Hector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. “Brother,”"
100,5,285,"said she, “to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind"
100,5,286,"had caught me up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had"
100,5,287,borne me to some mountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that
100,5,288,"should have swept me away ere this mischief had come about. But,"
100,5,289,"since the gods have devised these evils, would, at any rate, that"
100,5,290,I had been wife to a better man — to one who could smart under
100,5,291,dishonour and men’s evil speeches. This fellow was never yet to
100,5,292,"be depended upon, nor never will be, and he will surely reap what"
100,5,293,"he has sown. Still, brother, come in and rest upon this seat, for"
100,5,294,it is you who bear the brunt of that toil that has been caused by
100,5,295,my hateful self and by the sin of Alexandrus — both of whom Jove
100,5,296,has doomed to be a theme of song among those that shall be born
100,5,297,hereafter.”
100,5,298,"And Hector answered, “Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all the"
100,5,299,goodwill you bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the
100,5,300,"Trojans, who miss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge"
100,5,301,"your husband, and of his own self also let him make haste to"
100,5,302,overtake me before I am out of the city. I must go home to see my
100,5,303,"household, my wife and my little son, for I know not whether I"
100,5,304,"shall ever again return to them, or whether the gods will cause"
100,5,305,me to fall by the hands of the Achaeans.”
100,5,306,"Then Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did"
100,5,307,"not find Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and"
100,5,308,"one of her maids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was"
100,5,309,"not within, he stood on the threshold of the women’s rooms and"
100,5,310,"said, “Women, tell me, and tell me true, where did Andromache go"
100,5,311,"when she left the house? Was it to my sisters, or to my brothers’"
100,5,312,wives? or is she at the temple of Minerva where the other women
100,5,313,are propitiating the awful goddess?”
100,5,314,"His good housekeeper answered, “Hector, since you bid me tell you"
100,5,315,"truly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers’"
100,5,316,"wives, nor yet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women"
100,5,317,"are propitiating the awful goddess, but she is on the high wall"
100,5,318,"of Ilius, for she had heard the Trojans were being hard pressed,"
100,5,319,and that the Achaeans were in great force: she went to the wall
100,5,320,"in frenzied haste, and the nurse went with her carrying the"
100,5,321,child.”
100,5,322,"Hector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and"
100,5,323,went down the streets by the same way that he had come. When he
100,5,324,had gone through the city and had reached the Scaean gates
100,5,325,"through which he would go out on to the plain, his wife came"
100,5,326,"running towards him, Andromache, daughter of great Eetion who"
100,5,327,"ruled in Thebe under the wooded slopes of Mt. Placus, and was"
100,5,328,"king of the Cilicians. His daughter had married Hector, and now"
100,5,329,came to meet him with a nurse who carried his little child in her
100,5,330,"bosom — a mere babe. Hector’s darling son, and lovely as a star."
100,5,331,"Hector had named him Scamandrius, but the people called him"
100,5,332,"Astyanax, for his father stood alone as chief guardian of Ilius."
100,5,333,"Hector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak,"
100,5,334,and Andromache stood by him weeping and taking his hand in her
100,5,335,"own. “Dear husband,” said she, “your valour will bring you to"
100,5,336,"destruction; think on your infant son, and on my hapless self who"
100,5,337,ere long shall be your widow — for the Achaeans will set upon you
100,5,338,"in a body and kill you. It would be better for me, should I lose"
100,5,339,"you, to lie dead and buried, for I shall have nothing left to"
100,5,340,"comfort me when you are gone, save only sorrow. I have neither"
100,5,341,father nor mother now. Achilles slew my father when he sacked
100,5,342,"Thebe the goodly city of the Cilicians. He slew him, but did not"
100,5,343,for very shame despoil him; when he had burned him in his
100,5,344,"wondrous armour, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the"
100,5,345,"mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis - bearing Jove, planted a grove"
100,5,346,of elms about his tomb. I had seven brothers in my father’s
100,5,347,"house, but on the same day they all went within the house of"
100,5,348,Hades. Achilles killed them as they were with their sheep and
100,5,349,cattle. My mother — her who had been queen of all the land under
100,5,350,"Mt. Placus — he brought hither with the spoil, and freed her for a"
100,5,351,"great sum, but the archer - queen Diana took her in the house of"
100,5,352,"your father. Nay — Hector — you who to me are father, mother,"
100,5,353,"brother, and dear husband — have mercy upon me; stay here upon this"
100,5,354,"wall; make not your child fatherless, and your wife a widow; as"
100,5,355,"for the host, place them near the fig - tree, where the city can be"
100,5,356,"best scaled, and the wall is weakest. Thrice have the bravest of"
100,5,357,"them come thither and assailed it, under the two Ajaxes,"
100,5,358,"Idomeneus, the sons of Atreus, and the brave son of Tydeus,"
100,5,359,"either of their own bidding, or because some soothsayer had told"
100,5,360,them.”
100,5,361,"And Hector answered, “Wife, I too have thought upon all this, but"
100,5,362,"with what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if I"
100,5,363,shirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save
100,5,364,to fight bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win
100,5,365,renown alike for my father and myself. Well do I know that the
100,5,366,day will surely come when mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with
100,5,367,"Priam and Priam’s people, but I grieve for none of these — not even"
100,5,368,"for Hecuba, nor King Priam, nor for my brothers many and brave"
100,5,369,who may fall in the dust before their foes — for none of these do I
100,5,370,grieve as for yourself when the day shall come on which some one
100,5,371,"of the Achaeans shall rob you for ever of your freedom, and bear"
100,5,372,you weeping away. It may be that you will have to ply the loom in
100,5,373,"Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or to fetch water from the"
100,5,374,"springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutally by some cruel"
100,5,375,"task - master; then will one say who sees you weeping, ‘She was"
100,5,376,"wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojans during the"
100,5,377,war before Ilius.’ On this your tears will break forth anew for
100,5,378,him who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May I
100,5,379,lie dead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hear
100,5,380,your cry as they carry you into bondage.”
100,5,381,"He stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and"
100,5,382,"nestled in his nurse’s bosom, scared at the sight of his father’s"
100,5,383,"armour, and at the horse - hair plume that nodded fiercely from his"
100,5,384,"helmet. His father and mother laughed to see him, but Hector took"
100,5,385,the helmet from his head and laid it all gleaming upon the
100,5,386,"ground. Then he took his darling child, kissed him, and dandled"
100,5,387,"him in his arms, praying over him the while to Jove and to all"
100,5,388,"the gods. “Jove,” he cried, “grant that this my child may be even"
100,5,389,"as myself, chief among the Trojans; let him be not less excellent"
100,5,390,"in strength, and let him rule Ilius with his might. Then may one"
100,5,391,"say of him as he comes from battle, ‘The son is far better than"
100,5,392,the father.’ May he bring back the blood - stained spoils of him
100,5,393,"whom he has laid low, and let his mother’s heart be glad.”"
100,5,394,"With this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who"
100,5,395,"took him to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As her"
100,5,396,husband watched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed
100,5,397,"her fondly, saying, “My own wife, do not take these things too"
100,5,398,bitterly to heart. No one can hurry me down to Hades before my
100,5,399,"time, but if a man’s hour is come, be he brave or be he coward,"
100,5,400,"there is no escape for him when he has once been born. Go, then,"
100,5,401,"within the house, and busy yourself with your daily duties, your"
100,5,402,"loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for war is"
100,5,403,"man’s matter, and mine above all others of them that have been"
100,5,404,born in Ilius.”
100,5,405,"He took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back"
100,5,406,"again to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back"
100,5,407,towards him. When she reached her home she found her maidens
100,5,408,"within, and bade them all join in her lament; so they mourned"
100,5,409,"Hector in his own house though he was yet alive, for they deemed"
100,5,410,"that they should never see him return safe from battle, and from"
100,5,411,the furious hands of the Achaeans.
100,5,412,Paris did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly
100,5,413,"armour overlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast"
100,5,414,"as his feet could take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks"
100,5,415,loose and gallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he
100,5,416,is wont to bathe in the fair - flowing river — he holds his head
100,5,417,"high, and his mane streams upon his shoulders as he exults in his"
100,5,418,strength and flies like the wind to the haunts and feeding ground
100,5,419,"of the mares — even so went forth Paris from high Pergamus,"
100,5,420,"gleaming like sunlight in his armour, and he laughed aloud as he"
100,5,421,sped swiftly on his way. Forthwith he came upon his brother
100,5,422,"Hector, who was then turning away from the place where he had"
100,5,423,"held converse with his wife, and he was himself the first to"
100,5,424,"speak. “Sir,” said he, “I fear that I have kept you waiting when"
100,5,425,"you are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you bade me.”"
100,5,426,"“My good brother,” answered Hector, “you fight bravely, and no"
100,5,427,man with any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But
100,5,428,you are careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart
100,5,429,"to hear the ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have"
100,5,430,"suffered much on your account. Let us be going, and we will make"
100,5,431,"things right hereafter, should Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup"
100,5,432,of our deliverance before ever - living gods of heaven in our own
100,5,433,"homes, when we have chased the Achaeans from Troy.”"
100,6,1,Hector and Ajax fight — Hector is getting worsted when night comes
100,6,2,"on and parts them — They exchange presents — The burial of the dead,"
100,6,3,and the building of a wall round their ships by the Achaeans — The
100,6,4,Achaeans buy their wine of Agamemnon and Menelaus.
100,6,5,"With these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother"
100,6,6,"Alexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven"
100,6,7,"sends a breeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain,"
100,6,8,"and have laboured at their oars till they are faint with toil,"
100,6,9,even so welcome was the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.
100,6,10,Thereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he
100,6,11,"lived in Arne, and was son of Areithous the Mace - man, and of"
100,6,12,Phylomedusa. Hector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead
100,6,13,with a wound in the neck under the bronze rim of his helmet.
100,6,14,"Glaucus, moreover, son of Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in"
100,6,15,hard hand - to - hand fight smote Iphinous son of Dexius on the
100,6,16,"shoulder, as he was springing on to his chariot behind his fleet"
100,6,17,"mares; so he fell to earth from the car, and there was no life"
100,6,18,left in him.
100,6,19,"When, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the"
100,6,20,"Argives, she darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus,"
100,6,21,"and Apollo, who was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet"
100,6,22,her; for he wanted the Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by
100,6,23,"the oak tree, and King Apollo son of Jove was first to speak."
100,6,24,"“What would you have,” said he, “daughter of great Jove, that"
100,6,25,your proud spirit has sent you hither from Olympus? Have you no
100,6,26,"pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline the scales of"
100,6,27,victory in favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade you — for it will
100,6,28,"be better thus — stay the combat for to - day, but let them renew the"
100,6,29,"fight hereafter till they compass the doom of Ilius, since you"
100,6,30,goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.”
100,6,31,"And Minerva answered, “So be it, Far - Darter; it was in this mind"
100,6,32,that I came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell
100,6,33,"me, then, how do you propose to end this present fighting?”"
100,6,34,"Apollo, son of Jove, replied, “Let us incite great Hector to"
100,6,35,challenge some one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the
100,6,36,Achaeans will be shamed into finding a man who will fight him.”
100,6,37,"Minerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of"
100,6,38,"the gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, “Hector son of"
100,6,39,"Priam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then"
100,6,40,persuade you. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take
100,6,41,"their seats, and challenge the best man among the Achaeans to"
100,6,42,meet you in single combat. I have heard the voice of the
100,6,43,"ever - living gods, and the hour of your doom is not yet come.”"
100,6,44,"Hector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the"
100,6,45,"Trojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and"
100,6,46,they all sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated.
100,6,47,"But Minerva and Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on"
100,6,48,"father Jove’s high oak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks"
100,6,49,"sat close ranged together, bristling with shield and helmet and"
100,6,50,spear. As when the rising west wind furs the face of the sea and
100,6,51,"the waters grow dark beneath it, so sat the companies of Trojans"
100,6,52,and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector spoke thus: —
100,6,53,"“Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am"
100,6,54,minded; Jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and
100,6,55,"covenants to nothing, and foreshadows ill for both of us, till"
100,6,56,"you either take the towers of Troy, or are yourselves vanquished"
100,6,57,at your ships. The princes of the Achaeans are here present in
100,6,58,"the midst of you; let him, then, that will fight me stand forward"
100,6,59,"as your champion against Hector. Thus I say, and may Jove be"
100,6,60,"witness between us. If your champion slay me, let him strip me of"
100,6,61,"my armour and take it to your ships, but let him send my body"
100,6,62,home that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire
100,6,63,"when I am dead. In like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe me glory and"
100,6,64,"I slay your champion, I will strip him of his armour and take it"
100,6,65,"to the city of Ilius, where I will hang it in the temple of"
100,6,66,"Apollo, but I will give up his body, that the Achaeans may bury"
100,6,67,"him at their ships,and then build him a mound by the wide waters"
100,6,68,of the Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sails his
100,6,69,"ship over the sea, ‘This is the monument of one who died long"
100,6,70,since a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.’ Thus will one
100,6,71,"say, and my fame shall not be lost.”"
100,6,72,"Thus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to"
100,6,73,"decline the challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last"
100,6,74,"Menelaus rose and rebuked them, for he was angry. “Alas,” he"
100,6,75,"cried, “vain braggarts, women forsooth not men, double - dyed"
100,6,76,indeed will be the stain upon us if no man of the Danaans will
100,6,77,now face Hector. May you be turned every man of you into earth
100,6,78,and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in your places. I
100,6,79,"will myself go out against this man, but the upshot of the fight"
100,6,80,will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.”
100,6,81,"With these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your"
100,6,82,"life would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector,"
100,6,83,"for he was far better the man, had not the princes of the"
100,6,84,Achaeans sprung upon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught
100,6,85,"him by the right hand and said, “Menelaus, you are mad; a truce"
100,6,86,"to this folly. Be patient in spite of passion, do not think of"
100,6,87,fighting a man so much stronger than yourself as Hector son of
100,6,88,"Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you. Even"
100,6,89,"Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are, shrank from"
100,6,90,"meeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the Achaeans"
100,6,91,will send some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and fond
100,6,92,"of battle though he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under"
100,6,93,him if he comes out alive from the hurly - burly of this fight.”
100,6,94,"With these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,"
100,6,95,whereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his
100,6,96,"shoulders. Then Nestor rose and spoke, “Of a truth,” said he,"
100,6,97,“the Achaean land is fallen upon evil times. The old knight
100,6,98,"Peleus, counsellor and orator among the Myrmidons, loved when I"
100,6,99,was in his house to question me concerning the race and lineage
100,6,100,of all the Argives. How would it not grieve him could he hear of
100,6,101,them as now quailing before Hector? Many a time would he lift his
100,6,102,hands in prayer that his soul might leave his body and go down
100,6,103,"within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and"
100,6,104,"Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the Pylians"
100,6,105,and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon
100,6,106,"under the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river"
100,6,107,Iardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their
100,6,108,"champion, with the armour of King Areithous upon his"
100,6,109,shoulders — Areithous whom men and women had surnamed ‘the
100,6,110,"Mace - man,’ because he fought neither with bow nor spear, but"
100,6,111,broke the battalions of the foe with his iron mace. Lycurgus
100,6,112,"killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow"
100,6,113,way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was too
100,6,114,"quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell to"
100,6,115,earth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which
100,6,116,"Mars had given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when"
100,6,117,"he grew old and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire"
100,6,118,"Ereuthalion, who in this same armour challenged the foremost men"
100,6,119,"among us. The others quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade"
100,6,120,me fight him though none other would venture; I was the youngest
100,6,121,man of them all; but when I fought him Minerva vouchsafed me
100,6,122,"victory. He was the biggest and strongest man that ever I killed,"
100,6,123,and covered much ground as he lay sprawling upon the earth. Would
100,6,124,"that I were still young and strong as I then was, for the son of"
100,6,125,"Priam would then soon find one who would face him. But you,"
100,6,126,"foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of you any"
100,6,127,stomach for fighting Hector.”
100,6,128,"Thus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started"
100,6,129,"to their feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after"
100,6,130,"him brave Diomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men"
100,6,131,"clothed in valour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and"
100,6,132,Meriones his brother in arms. After these Eurypylus son of
100,6,133,"Euaemon, Thoas the son of Andraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then"
100,6,134,"Nestor knight of Gerene again spoke, saying: “Cast lots among you"
100,6,135,to see who shall be chosen. If he come alive out of this fight he
100,6,136,will have done good service alike to his own soul and to the
100,6,137,Achaeans.”
100,6,138,"Thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had"
100,6,139,"thrown it into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people"
100,6,140,"lifted their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as"
100,6,141,"he looked into the vault of heaven, “Father Jove, grant that the"
100,6,142,"lot fall on Ajax, or on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of"
100,6,143,rich Mycene himself.”
100,6,144,"As they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet,"
100,6,145,and from it there fell the very lot which they wanted — the lot of
100,6,146,Ajax. The herald bore it about and showed it to all the
100,6,147,"chieftains of the Achaeans, going from left to right; but they"
100,6,148,"none of them owned it. When, however, in due course he reached"
100,6,149,"the man who had written upon it and had put it into the helmet,"
100,6,150,"brave Ajax held out his hand, and the herald gave him the lot."
100,6,151,When Ajax saw his mark he knew it and was glad; he threw it to
100,6,152,"the ground and said, “My friends, the lot is mine, and I rejoice,"
100,6,153,"for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my armour; meanwhile,"
100,6,154,pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves that the Trojans
100,6,155,"may not hear you — or aloud if you will, for we fear no man. None"
100,6,156,"shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I was born"
100,6,157,"and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.”"
100,6,158,"With this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and"
100,6,159,"thus would one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven,"
100,6,160,"“Father Jove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power,"
100,6,161,"vouchsafe victory to Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if"
100,6,162,"you wish well to Hector also and would protect him, grant to each"
100,6,163,of them equal fame and prowess.”
100,6,164,"Thus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming"
100,6,165,bronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous
100,6,166,Mars when he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with
100,6,167,"one another — even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans,"
100,6,168,spring forward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his
100,6,169,long spear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they
100,6,170,"beheld him, but the Trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart"
100,6,171,"even of Hector beat quickly, but he could not now retreat and"
100,6,172,"withdraw into the ranks behind him, for he had been the"
100,6,173,challenger. Ajax came up bearing his shield in front of him like
100,6,174,a wall — a shield of bronze with seven folds of oxhide — the work of
100,6,175,"Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the best worker in"
100,6,176,"leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full - fed bulls,"
100,6,177,and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding this
100,6,178,"shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector,"
100,6,179,"and menaced him saying, “Hector, you shall now learn, man to man,"
100,6,180,what kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides
100,6,181,lion - hearted Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides
100,6,182,"at the ships in anger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but"
100,6,183,there are many of us who are well able to face you; therefore
100,6,184,begin the fight.”
100,6,185,"And Hector answered, “Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the"
100,6,186,"host, treat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that"
100,6,187,cannot fight. I have been long used to the blood and butcheries
100,6,188,of battle. I am quick to turn my leathern shield either to right
100,6,189,"or left, for this I deem the main thing in battle. I can charge"
100,6,190,"among the chariots and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can"
100,6,191,delight the heart of Mars; howbeit I would not take such a man as
100,6,192,you are off his guard — but I will smite you openly if I can.”
100,6,193,"He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It"
100,6,194,"struck the sevenfold shield in its outermost layer — the eighth,"
100,6,195,which was of bronze — and went through six of the layers but in the
100,6,196,"seventh hide it stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck"
100,6,197,the round shield of the son of Priam. The terrible spear went
100,6,198,"through his gleaming shield, and pressed onward through his"
100,6,199,cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced the shirt against his
100,6,200,"side, but he swerved and thus saved his life. They then each of"
100,6,201,"them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on one another"
100,6,202,like savage lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance:
100,6,203,"the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax’s shield, but the"
100,6,204,"bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned. Ajax"
100,6,205,then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear
100,6,206,went through it and staggered him as he was springing forward to
100,6,207,attack; it gashed his neck and the blood came pouring from the
100,6,208,"wound, but even so Hector did not cease fighting; he gave ground,"
100,6,209,"and with his brawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that"
100,6,210,was lying upon the plain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax
100,6,211,"on the boss that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang"
100,6,212,"again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone, swung it"
100,6,213,"aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of a"
100,6,214,rock broke Hector’s shield inwards and threw him down on his back
100,6,215,"with the shield crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at"
100,6,216,once. Thereon they would have hacked at one another in close
100,6,217,"combat with their swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and"
100,6,218,"men, come forward, one from the Trojans and the other from the"
100,6,219,Achaeans — Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable men; these
100,6,220,"parted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said,"
100,6,221,"“My sons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both"
100,6,222,"are dear to Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the"
100,6,223,behests of night may not be well gainsaid.”
100,6,224,"Ajax son of Telamon answered, “Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it"
100,6,225,was he that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I
100,6,226,will accept his saying.”
100,6,227,"Then Hector said, “Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and"
100,6,228,"strength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all"
100,6,229,others of the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting;
100,6,230,"hereafter we will fight anew till heaven decide between us, and"
100,6,231,"give victory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and"
100,6,232,"the behests of night may not be well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the"
100,6,233,"hearts of the Achaeans at your ships, and more especially those"
100,6,234,"of your own followers and clansmen, while I, in the great city of"
100,6,235,"King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their women, who vie"
100,6,236,"with one another in their prayers on my behalf. Let us, moreover,"
100,6,237,exchange presents that it may be said among the Achaeans and
100,6,238,"Trojans, ‘They fought with might and main, but were reconciled"
100,6,239,and parted in friendship.’”
100,6,240,On this he gave Ajax a silver - studded sword with its sheath and
100,6,241,"leathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with"
100,6,242,"purple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the"
100,6,243,"Achaeans, and the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when"
100,6,244,they saw their hero come to them safe and unharmed from the
100,6,245,"strong hands of mighty Ajax. They led him, therefore, to the city"
100,6,246,as one that had been saved beyond their hopes. On the other side
100,6,247,the Achaeans brought Ajax elated with victory to Agamemnon.
100,6,248,"When they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon"
100,6,249,sacrificed for them a five - year - old bull in honour of Jove the
100,6,250,"son of Saturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and"
100,6,251,divided it into joints; these they cut carefully up into smaller
100,6,252,"pieces, putting them on the spits, roasting them sufficiently,"
100,6,253,and then drawing them off. When they had done all this and had
100,6,254,"prepared the feast, they ate it, and every man had his full and"
100,6,255,"equal share, so that all were satisfied, and King Agamemnon gave"
100,6,256,"Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin, as a mark of"
100,6,257,"special honour. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,"
100,6,258,old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak; with all
100,6,259,"sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus: —"
100,6,260,"“Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the"
100,6,261,"Achaeans are now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of"
100,6,262,"the Scamander, and their souls have gone down to the house of"
100,6,263,"Hades, it will be well when morning comes that we should cease"
100,6,264,fighting; we will then wheel our dead together with oxen and
100,6,265,"mules and burn them not far from the ships, that when we sail"
100,6,266,hence we may take the bones of our comrades home to their
100,6,267,children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow that
100,6,268,shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let
100,6,269,"us set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our"
100,6,270,"ships, and let it have well - made gates that there may be a way"
100,6,271,through them for our chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep
100,6,272,"trench all round it to keep off both horse and foot, that the"
100,6,273,Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us.”
100,6,274,"Thus he spoke, and the princes shouted in applause. Meanwhile"
100,6,275,"the Trojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the"
100,6,276,acropolis by the gates of King Priam’s palace; and wise Antenor
100,6,277,"spoke. “Hear me,” he said, “Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that"
100,6,278,I may speak even as I am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and
100,6,279,"her wealth to the sons of Atreus, for we are now fighting in"
100,6,280,"violation of our solemn covenants, and shall not prosper till we"
100,6,281,have done as I say.”
100,6,282,He then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to
100,6,283,"speak. “Antenor,” said he, “your words are not to my liking; you"
100,6,284,"can find a better saying than this if you will; if, however, you"
100,6,285,"have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of"
100,6,286,"your reason. I will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the"
100,6,287,Trojans that I will not give up the woman; but the wealth that I
100,6,288,"brought home with her from Argos I will restore, and will add yet"
100,6,289,further of my own.”
100,6,290,"On this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the"
100,6,291,"race of Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all"
100,6,292,"sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: “Hear me, Trojans,"
100,6,293,"Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get"
100,6,294,"your suppers now as hitherto throughout the city, but keep your"
100,6,295,"watches and be wakeful. At daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships,"
100,6,296,and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus sons of Atreus the saying of
100,6,297,Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about; and let him
100,6,298,also be instant with them that they now cease fighting till we
100,6,299,"burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide"
100,6,300,between us and give victory to one or to the other.”
100,6,301,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took"
100,6,302,supper in their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his way to
100,6,303,"the ships. He found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at"
100,6,304,"the stern of Agamemnon’s ship, and took his place in the midst of"
100,6,305,"them. “Son of Atreus,” he said, “and princes of the Achaean host,"
100,6,306,Priam and the other noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the
100,6,307,"saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about, if"
100,6,308,so be that you may find it acceptable. All the treasure he took
100,6,309,with him in his ships to Troy — would that he had sooner
100,6,310,"perished — he will restore, and will add yet further of his own,"
100,6,311,"but he will not give up the wedded wife of Menelaus, though the"
100,6,312,Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me inquire further if
100,6,313,you will cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will
100,6,314,"fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one"
100,6,315,or to the other.”
100,6,316,"They all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud"
100,6,317,"war - cry spoke, saying, “Let there be no taking, neither treasure,"
100,6,318,"nor yet Helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the"
100,6,319,Trojans is at hand.”
100,6,320,The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that
100,6,321,"Diomed had spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus,"
100,6,322,"“Idaeus, you have heard the answer the Achaeans make you - and I"
100,6,323,"with them. But as concerning the dead, I give you leave to burn"
100,6,324,"them, for when men are once dead there should be no grudging them"
100,6,325,the rites of fire. Let Jove the mighty husband of Juno be witness
100,6,326,to this covenant.”
100,6,327,"As he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods,"
100,6,328,and Idaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and
100,6,329,Dardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he
100,6,330,"came, he stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon"
100,6,331,"as they heard it they set about their twofold labour, some to"
100,6,332,"gather the corpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on"
100,6,333,"their part also hastened from their ships, some to gather the"
100,6,334,"corpses, and others to bring in wood."
100,6,335,"The sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into"
100,6,336,"the vault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus,"
100,6,337,"when the two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead,"
100,6,338,"but they washed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over"
100,6,339,"them, and lifted them upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the"
100,6,340,"Trojans to wail aloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and"
100,6,341,"silently upon the pyre, and having burned them went back to the"
100,6,342,city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner heaped their dead
100,6,343,"sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned them went back"
100,6,344,to their ships.
100,6,345,"Now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the"
100,6,346,Achaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that
100,6,347,"was raised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high"
100,6,348,wall to shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong
100,6,349,"gates that there might be a way through them for their chariots,"
100,6,350,"and close outside it they dug a trench deep and wide, and they"
100,6,351,planted it within with stakes.
100,6,352,"Thus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of"
100,6,353,"Jove the lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but"
100,6,354,"Neptune, lord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, “Father Jove,"
100,6,355,what mortal in the whole world will again take the gods into his
100,6,356,counsel? See you not how the Achaeans have built a wall about
100,6,357,"their ships and driven a trench all round it, without offering"
100,6,358,hecatombs to the gods? The fame of this wall will reach as far as
100,6,359,"dawn itself, and men will no longer think anything of the one"
100,6,360,which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much labour for
100,6,361,Laomedon.”
100,6,362,"Jove was displeased and answered, “What, O shaker of the earth,"
100,6,363,are you talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be
100,6,364,"alarmed at what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as"
100,6,365,dawn itself. Surely when the Achaeans have gone home with their
100,6,366,"ships, you can shatter their wall and fling it into the sea; you"
100,6,367,"can cover the beach with sand again, and the great wall of the"
100,6,368,Achaeans will then be utterly effaced.”
100,6,369,"Thus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans"
100,6,370,was completed; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got
100,6,371,"their supper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by"
100,6,372,"Euneus the son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of"
100,6,373,"Jason freighted them with ten thousand measures of wine, which he"
100,6,374,"sent specially to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus."
100,6,375,"From this supply the Achaeans bought their wine, some with"
100,6,376,"bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some with whole heifers,"
100,6,377,and some again with captives. They spread a goodly banquet and
100,6,378,"feasted the whole night through, as also did the Trojans and"
100,6,379,their allies in the city. But all the time Jove boded them ill
100,6,380,and roared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold upon
100,6,381,"them, and they spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground,"
100,6,382,nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to the most
100,6,383,mighty son of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down to rest and
100,6,384,enjoyed the boon of sleep.
100,7,1,Jove forbids the gods to interfere further — There is an even fight
100,7,2,"till midday, but then Jove inclines the scales of victory in"
100,7,3,"favour of the Trojans, who eventually chase the Achaeans within"
100,7,4,their wall — Juno and Minerva set out to help the Trojans: Jove
100,7,5,"sends Iris to turn them back, but later on he promises Juno that"
100,7,6,she shall have her way in the end — Hector’s triumph is stayed by
100,7,7,nightfall — The Trojans bivouac on the plain.
100,7,8,"Now when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to"
100,7,9,"suffuse light over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on"
100,7,10,the topmost crest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the
100,7,11,"other gods gave ear. “Hear me,” said he, “gods and goddesses,"
100,7,12,that I may speak even as I am minded. Let none of you neither
100,7,13,"goddess nor god try to cross me, but obey me every one of you"
100,7,14,that I may bring this matter to an end. If I see anyone acting
100,7,15,"apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans, he shall be beaten"
100,7,16,inordinately ere he come back again to Olympus; or I will hurl
100,7,17,him down into dark Tartarus far into the deepest pit under the
100,7,18,"earth, where the gates are iron and the floor bronze, as far"
100,7,19,"beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may"
100,7,20,learn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find out
100,7,21,"for yourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold"
100,7,22,"of it all of you, gods and goddesses together — tug as you will,"
100,7,23,you will not drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to
100,7,24,earth; but were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with
100,7,25,"earth and sea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about"
100,7,26,some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid
100,7,27,firmament. So far am I above all others either of gods or men.”
100,7,28,"They were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he"
100,7,29,"had spoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, “Father,"
100,7,30,"son of Saturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not"
100,7,31,"to be gainsaid, but we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors,"
100,7,32,"who are perishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however,"
100,7,33,"since you so bid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will"
100,7,34,make serviceable suggestions to the Argives that they may not all
100,7,35,of them perish in your displeasure.”
100,7,36,"Jove smiled at her and answered, “Take heart, my child,"
100,7,37,"Trito - born; I am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to"
100,7,38,you.”
100,7,39,"With this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and"
100,7,40,manes of glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about
100,7,41,"the body, seized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot."
100,7,42,Thereon he lashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth
100,7,43,midway twixt earth and starry heaven. After a while he reached
100,7,44,"many - fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where"
100,7,45,are his grove and fragrant altar. There the father of gods and
100,7,46,"men stayed his horses, took them from the chariot, and hid them"
100,7,47,in a thick cloud; then he took his seat all glorious upon the
100,7,48,"topmost crests, looking down upon the city of Troy and the ships"
100,7,49,of the Achaeans.
100,7,50,"The Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and"
100,7,51,afterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand
100,7,52,"likewise armed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers"
100,7,53,but nevertheless eager perforce to do battle for their wives and
100,7,54,"children. All the gates were flung wide open, and horse and foot"
100,7,55,sallied forth with the tramp as of a great multitude.
100,7,56,"When they were got together in one place, shield clashed with"
100,7,57,"shield, and spear with spear, in the conflict of mail - clad men."
100,7,58,Mighty was the din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one
100,7,59,"another — death — cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and"
100,7,60,the earth ran red with blood.
100,7,61,Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their
100,7,62,"weapons beat against one another, and the people fell, but when"
100,7,63,"the sun had reached mid - heaven, the sire of all balanced his"
100,7,64,"golden scales, and put two fates of death within them, one for"
100,7,65,the Trojans and the other for the Achaeans. He took the balance
100,7,66,"by the middle, and when he lifted it up the day of the Achaeans"
100,7,67,sank; the death - fraught scale of the Achaeans settled down upon
100,7,68,"the ground, while that of the Trojans rose heavenwards. Then he"
100,7,69,"thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the glare of his lightning"
100,7,70,"upon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear fell upon them"
100,7,71,and they were sore afraid.
100,7,72,"Idomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two"
100,7,73,"Ajaxes, servants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of"
100,7,74,"Gerene alone stood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own"
100,7,75,"will, but one of his horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of"
100,7,76,lovely Helen had hit it with an arrow just on the top of its head
100,7,77,"where the mane begins to grow away from the skull, a very deadly"
100,7,78,place. The horse bounded in his anguish as the arrow pierced his
100,7,79,"brain, and his struggles threw others into confusion. The old man"
100,7,80,"instantly began cutting the traces with his sword, but Hector’s"
100,7,81,fleet horses bore down upon him through the rout with their bold
100,7,82,"charioteer, even Hector himself, and the old man would have"
100,7,83,"perished there and then had not Diomed been quick to mark, and"
100,7,84,with a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.
100,7,85,"“Ulysses,” he cried, “noble son of Laertes where are you flying"
100,7,86,"to, with your back turned like a coward? See that you are not"
100,7,87,struck with a spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me
100,7,88,to defend Nestor from this man’s furious onset.”
100,7,89,"Ulysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the"
100,7,90,"Achaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the"
100,7,91,thick of the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of
100,7,92,"Neleus. “Sir,” said he, “these young warriors are pressing you"
100,7,93,"hard, your force is spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire"
100,7,94,"is naught, and your horses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and"
100,7,95,see what the horses of Tros can do — how cleverly they can scud
100,7,96,hither and thither over the plain either in flight or in pursuit.
100,7,97,I took them from the hero Aeneas. Let our squires attend to your
100,7,98,"own steeds, but let us drive mine straight at the Trojans, that"
100,7,99,Hector may learn how furiously I too can wield my spear.”
100,7,100,Nestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the
100,7,101,"doughty squires, Sthenelus and kind - hearted Eurymedon, saw to"
100,7,102,"Nestor’s horses, while the two both mounted Diomed’s chariot."
100,7,103,Nestor took the reins in his hands and lashed the horses on; they
100,7,104,"were soon close up with Hector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a"
100,7,105,spear at him as he was charging full speed towards them. He
100,7,106,"missed him, but struck his charioteer and squire Eniopeus son of"
100,7,107,noble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple while the reins were
100,7,108,"in his hands, so that he died there and then, and the horses"
100,7,109,swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. Hector was greatly
100,7,110,"grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie for all"
100,7,111,"his sorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his"
100,7,112,"steeds have to go long without one, for he presently found brave"
100,7,113,"Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind the"
100,7,114,"horses, giving the reins into his hand."
100,7,115,"All had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have"
100,7,116,"been penned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and"
100,7,117,"men been quick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt"
100,7,118,which fell just in front of Diomed’s horses with a flare of
100,7,119,burning brimstone. The horses were frightened and tried to back
100,7,120,"beneath the car, while the reins dropped from Nestor’s hands."
100,7,121,"Then he was afraid and said to Diomed, “Son of Tydeus, turn your"
100,7,122,horses in flight; see you not that the hand of Jove is against
100,7,123,"you? To - day he vouchsafes victory to Hector; to - morrow, if it so"
100,7,124,"please him, he will again grant it to ourselves; no man, however"
100,7,125,"brave, may thwart the purpose of Jove, for he is far stronger"
100,7,126,than any.”
100,7,127,"Diomed answered, “All that you have said is true; there is a"
100,7,128,"grief however which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will"
100,7,129,"talk among the Trojans and say, ‘The son of Tydeus fled before me"
100,7,130,"to the ships.’ This is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then"
100,7,131,swallow me.”
100,7,132,"“Son of Tydeus,” replied Nestor, “what mean you? Though Hector"
100,7,133,say that you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not
100,7,134,"believe him, nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you"
100,7,135,have laid low.”
100,7,136,So saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the
100,7,137,"battle, and with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector"
100,7,138,"rained their darts after them. Hector shouted to him and said,"
100,7,139,"“Son of Tydeus, the Danaans have done you honour hitherto as"
100,7,140,"regards your place at table, the meals they give you, and the"
100,7,141,"filling of your cup with wine. Henceforth they will despise you,"
100,7,142,"for you are become no better than a woman. Be off, girl and"
100,7,143,"coward that you are, you shall not scale our walls through any"
100,7,144,flinching upon my part; neither shall you carry off our wives in
100,7,145,"your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand.”"
100,7,146,The son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his
100,7,147,"horses round again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice"
100,7,148,did Jove thunder from the heights of Ida in token to the Trojans
100,7,149,that he would turn the battle in their favour. Hector then
100,7,150,"shouted to them and said, “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians,"
100,7,151,"lovers of close fighting, be men, my friends, and fight with"
100,7,152,might and with main; I see that Jove is minded to vouchsafe
100,7,153,"victory and great glory to myself, while he will deal destruction"
100,7,154,"upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building this weak"
100,7,155,and worthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses will
100,7,156,"spring lightly over their trench, and when I am at their ships"
100,7,157,"forget not to bring me fire that I may burn them, while I"
100,7,158,slaughter the Argives who will be all dazed and bewildered by the
100,7,159,smoke.”
100,7,160,"Then he cried to his horses, “Xanthus and Podargus, and you"
100,7,161,"Aethon and goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all"
100,7,162,the honey - sweet corn with which Andromache daughter of great
100,7,163,"Eetion has fed you, and for she has mixed wine and water for you"
100,7,164,"to drink whenever you would, before doing so even for me who am"
100,7,165,"her own husband. Haste in pursuit, that we may take the shield of"
100,7,166,"Nestor, the fame of which ascends to heaven, for it is of solid"
100,7,167,"gold, arm - rods and all, and that we may strip from the shoulders"
100,7,168,of Diomed the cuirass which Vulcan made him. Could we take these
100,7,169,"two things, the Achaeans would set sail in their ships this"
100,7,170,self - same night.”
100,7,171,"Thus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she"
100,7,172,shook with rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god
100,7,173,"of Neptune, “What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can"
100,7,174,"you find no compassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who"
100,7,175,bring you many a welcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish
100,7,176,them well then. If all of us who are with the Danaans were to
100,7,177,"drive the Trojans back and keep Jove from helping them, he would"
100,7,178,have to sit there sulking alone on Ida.”
100,7,179,"King Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, “Juno, rash of"
100,7,180,"tongue, what are you talking about? We other gods must not set"
100,7,181,"ourselves against Jove, for he is far stronger than we are.”"
100,7,182,Thus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the
100,7,183,"ditch, from the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses"
100,7,184,"and warriors, who were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now"
100,7,185,that the hand of Jove was with him. He would even have set fire
100,7,186,"to the ships and burned them, had not Queen Juno put it into the"
100,7,187,"mind of Agamemnon, to bestir himself and to encourage the"
100,7,188,Achaeans. To this end he went round the ships and tents carrying
100,7,189,"a great purple cloak, and took his stand by the huge black hull"
100,7,190,"of Ulysses’ ship, which was middlemost of all; it was from this"
100,7,191,"place that his voice would carry farthest, on the one hand"
100,7,192,"towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other"
100,7,193,"towards those of Achilles — for these two heroes, well assured of"
100,7,194,"their own strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the"
100,7,195,"two ends of the line. From this spot then, with a voice that"
100,7,196,"could be heard afar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying, “Argives,"
100,7,197,"shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only; where"
100,7,198,are now our vaunts that we should prove victorious — the vaunts we
100,7,199,"made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate the flesh of horned"
100,7,200,cattle and filled our mixing - bowls to the brim? You vowed that
100,7,201,"you would each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred men,"
100,7,202,"and now you prove no match even for one — for Hector, who will be"
100,7,203,"ere long setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever"
100,7,204,so ruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness?
100,7,205,"Yet, when to my sorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship"
100,7,206,pass your altars without offering the fat and thigh - bones of
100,7,207,"heifers upon every one of them, so eager was I to sack the city"
100,7,208,of Troy. Vouchsafe me then this prayer — suffer us to escape at any
100,7,209,"rate with our lives, and let not the Achaeans be so utterly"
100,7,210,vanquished by the Trojans.”
100,7,211,"Thus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed"
100,7,212,"him that his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them"
100,7,213,"an eagle, most unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young"
100,7,214,fawn in its talons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on
100,7,215,"which the Achaeans sacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; when,"
100,7,216,"therefore, the people saw that the bird had come from Jove, they"
100,7,217,sprang more fiercely upon the Trojans and fought more boldly.
100,7,218,There was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast
100,7,219,that he had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to
100,7,220,fight sooner than the son of Tydeus; long before any one else
100,7,221,"could do so he slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the"
100,7,222,"son of Phradmon. He had turned his horses in flight, but the"
100,7,223,spear struck him in the back midway between his shoulders and
100,7,224,"went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round"
100,7,225,him as he fell forward from his chariot.
100,7,226,"After him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two"
100,7,227,"Ajaxes clothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his"
100,7,228,"companion in arms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus"
100,7,229,"the brave son of Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and"
100,7,230,took his place under cover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon.
100,7,231,"When Ajax lifted his shield Teucer would peer round, and when he"
100,7,232,"had hit any one in the throng, the man would fall dead; then"
100,7,233,"Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child to its mother, and again"
100,7,234,duck down under his shield.
100,7,235,"Which of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and"
100,7,236,"then Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike"
100,7,237,"Lycophontes, Amopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. All these"
100,7,238,"in turn did he lay low upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was"
100,7,239,glad when he saw him making havoc of the Trojans with his mighty
100,7,240,"bow. He went up to him and said, “Teucer, man after my own heart,"
100,7,241,"son of Telamon, captain among the host, shoot on, and be at once"
100,7,242,"the saving of the Danaans and the glory of your father Telamon,"
100,7,243,who brought you up and took care of you in his own house when you
100,7,244,"were a child, bastard though you were. Cover him with glory"
100,7,245,though he is far off; I will promise and I will assuredly
100,7,246,perform; if aegis - bearing Jove and Minerva grant me to sack the
100,7,247,"city of Ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after"
100,7,248,"my own — a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who"
100,7,249,shall go up into your bed.”
100,7,250,"And Teucer answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge"
100,7,251,"me; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have"
100,7,252,never ceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can
100,7,253,"shoot and kill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them"
100,7,254,"have been buried in the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog"
100,7,255,I cannot hit.”
100,7,256,"As he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was"
100,7,257,"bent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow"
100,7,258,"hit Priam’s brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair"
100,7,259,"Castianeira, lovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme,"
100,7,260,and now he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it
100,7,261,is weighed down by showers in spring — even thus heavy bowed his
100,7,262,head beneath the weight of his helmet.
100,7,263,"Again he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and"
100,7,264,"again his arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit"
100,7,265,"Hector’s brave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the"
100,7,266,"nipple, as he was driving furiously into the fight. The horses"
100,7,267,"swerved aside as he fell headlong from the chariot, and there was"
100,7,268,no life left in him. Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of
100,7,269,"his charioteer, but for all his sorrow he let him lie where he"
100,7,270,"fell, and bade his brother Cebriones, who was hard by, take the"
100,7,271,reins. Cebriones did as he had said. Hector thereon with a loud
100,7,272,"cry sprang from his chariot to the ground, and seizing a great"
100,7,273,stone made straight for Teucer with intent to kill him. Teucer
100,7,274,had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid it upon the
100,7,275,"bow - string, but Hector struck him with the jagged stone as he was"
100,7,276,taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit him
100,7,277,"just where the collar - bone divides the neck from the chest, a"
100,7,278,"very deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his"
100,7,279,"wrist was less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell"
100,7,280,"forward on his knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and"
100,7,281,running towards him bestrode him and sheltered him with his
100,7,282,"shield. Meanwhile his two trusty squires, Mecisteus son of"
100,7,283,"Echius, and Alastor, came up and bore him to the ships groaning"
100,7,284,in his great pain.
100,7,285,"Jove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the"
100,7,286,Achaeans to their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at
100,7,287,their head. As a hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or
100,7,288,"buttock when he gives him chase, and watches warily for his"
100,7,289,"wheeling, even so did Hector follow close upon the Achaeans, ever"
100,7,290,killing the hindmost as they rushed panic - stricken onwards. When
100,7,291,they had fled through the set stakes and trench and many Achaeans
100,7,292,"had been laid low at the hands of the Trojans, they halted at"
100,7,293,"their ships, calling upon one another and praying every man"
100,7,294,instantly as they lifted up their hands to the gods; but Hector
100,7,295,"wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring like those"
100,7,296,of Gorgo or murderous Mars.
100,7,297,"Juno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to"
100,7,298,"Minerva, “Alas, child of aegis - bearing Jove, shall you and I take"
100,7,299,"no more thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time"
100,7,300,we ever do so? See how they perish and come to a bad end before
100,7,301,the onset of but a single man. Hector the son of Priam rages with
100,7,302,"intolerable fury, and has already done great mischief.”"
100,7,303,"Minerva answered, “Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his"
100,7,304,"own land, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father"
100,7,305,"Jove is mad with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and"
100,7,306,unjust. He forgets how often I saved his son when he was worn out
100,7,307,by the labours Eurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his
100,7,308,"cry came up to heaven, and then Jove would send me down to help"
100,7,309,"him; if I had had the sense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus"
100,7,310,"sent him to the house of Hades, to fetch the hell - hound from"
100,7,311,"Erebus, he would never have come back alive out of the deep"
100,7,312,"waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates me, while he lets"
100,7,313,Thetis have her way because she kissed his knees and took hold of
100,7,314,"his beard, when she was begging him to do honour to Achilles. I"
100,7,315,shall know what to do next time he begins calling me his
100,7,316,"grey - eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go within the"
100,7,317,house of aegis - bearing Jove and put on my armour; we shall then
100,7,318,find out whether Priam’s son Hector will be glad to meet us in
100,7,319,"the highways of battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds"
100,7,320,and vultures with the fat of their flesh as they be dead by the
100,7,321,ships of the Achaeans.”
100,7,322,"Thus did she speak and white - armed Juno, daughter of great"
100,7,323,"Saturn, obeyed her words; she set about harnessing her"
100,7,324,"gold - bedizened steeds, while Minerva daughter of aegis - bearing"
100,7,325,"Jove flung her richly vesture, made with her own hands, on to the"
100,7,326,"threshold of her father, and donned the shirt of Jove, arming"
100,7,327,"herself for battle. Then she stepped into her flaming chariot,"
100,7,328,and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and strong with which
100,7,329,she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno
100,7,330,"lashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew"
100,7,331,"open of their own accord — gates over which the Hours preside, in"
100,7,332,"whose hands are heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense"
100,7,333,cloud that hides them or to close it. Through these the goddesses
100,7,334,drove their obedient steeds.
100,7,335,"But father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and"
100,7,336,"sent winged Iris with a message to them. “Go,” said he, “fleet"
100,7,337,"Iris, turn them back, and see that they do not come near me, for"
100,7,338,if we come to fighting there will be mischief. This is what I
100,7,339,"say, and this is what I mean to do. I will lame their horses for"
100,7,340,"them; I will hurl them from their chariot, and will break it in"
100,7,341,pieces. It will take them all ten years to heal the wounds my
100,7,342,lightning shall inflict upon them; my grey - eyed daughter will
100,7,343,then learn what quarrelling with her father means. I am less
100,7,344,"surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say she always"
100,7,345,contradicts me.”
100,7,346,"With this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights"
100,7,347,of Ida to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at
100,7,348,the outer gates of its many valleys and gave them her message.
100,7,349,"“What,” said she, “are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn"
100,7,350,"forbids going. This is what he says, and this is what he means to"
100,7,351,"do, he will lame your horses for you, he will hurl you from your"
100,7,352,"chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take you all ten"
100,7,353,"years to heal the wounds his lightning will inflict upon you,"
100,7,354,"that you may learn, grey - eyed goddess, what quarrelling with your"
100,7,355,"father means. He is less hurt and angry with Juno, for whatever"
100,7,356,"he says she always contradicts him but you, bold hussy, will you"
100,7,357,really dare to raise your huge spear in defiance of Jove?”
100,7,358,"With this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, “Of a truth,"
100,7,359,"child of aegis - bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men’s battles"
100,7,360,further in defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will
100,7,361,"have it, and let Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans"
100,7,362,and Danaans according to his own pleasure.”
100,7,363,"She turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made"
100,7,364,"them fast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot"
100,7,365,against the end wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat
100,7,366,"down upon their golden thrones, amid the company of the other"
100,7,367,gods; but they were very angry.
100,7,368,"Presently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered"
100,7,369,the assembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked
100,7,370,"his horses for him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth"
100,7,371,over it. Jove then sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus
100,7,372,"reeled beneath him. Minerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove,"
100,7,373,"and neither spoke nor asked him questions, but Jove knew what"
100,7,374,"they meant, and said, “Minerva and Juno, why are you so angry?"
100,7,375,Are you fatigued with killing so many of your dear friends the
100,7,376,"Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might of my hands that"
100,7,377,all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were both of you
100,7,378,trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its terrible
100,7,379,doings. I tell you therefore - and it would have surely been — I
100,7,380,"should have struck you with lightning, and your chariots would"
100,7,381,never have brought you back again to Olympus.”
100,7,382,Minerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and
100,7,383,brooded mischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a
100,7,384,"word, for she was in a furious passion and bitterly incensed"
100,7,385,"against her father; but Juno could not contain herself and said,"
100,7,386,"“What, dread son of Saturn, are you talking about? We know how"
100,7,387,"great your power is, nevertheless we have compassion upon the"
100,7,388,Danaan warriors who are perishing and coming to a bad end. We
100,7,389,"will, however, since you so bid us, refrain from actual fighting,"
100,7,390,"but we will make serviceable suggestions to the Argives, that"
100,7,391,they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.”
100,7,392,"And Jove answered, “To - morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do"
100,7,393,"so, you will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of"
100,7,394,"the Argives, for fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he"
100,7,395,has roused the son of Peleus when they are fighting in dire
100,7,396,straits at their ships’ sterns about the body of Patroclus. Like
100,7,397,"it or no, this is how it is decreed; for aught I care, you may go"
100,7,398,"to the lowest depths beneath earth and sea, where Iapetus and"
100,7,399,Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus with neither ray of light nor
100,7,400,breath of wind to cheer them. You may go on and on till you get
100,7,401,"there, and I shall not care one whit for your displeasure; you"
100,7,402,are the greatest vixen living.”
100,7,403,Juno made him no answer. The sun’s glorious orb now sank into
100,7,404,Oceanus and drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the
100,7,405,"Trojans when light failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for"
100,7,406,did darkness fall upon the Achaeans.
100,7,407,"Then Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a"
100,7,408,"council on the open space near the river, where there was a spot"
100,7,409,clear of corpses. They left their chariots and sat down on the
100,7,410,ground to hear the speech he made them. He grasped a spear eleven
100,7,411,"cubits long, the bronze point of which gleamed in front of it,"
100,7,412,while the ring round the spear - head was of gold. Spear in hand he
100,7,413,"spoke. “Hear me,” said he, “Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. I"
100,7,414,deemed but now that I should destroy the ships and all the
100,7,415,"Achaeans with them ere I went back to Ilius, but darkness came on"
100,7,416,too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their ships upon
100,7,417,"the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey the behests of night,"
100,7,418,and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots
100,7,419,and give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep
100,7,420,and cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your
100,7,421,"horses and gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn"
100,7,422,watchfires whose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may
100,7,423,"try to fly beyond the sea by night, and they must not embark"
100,7,424,scatheless and unmolested; many a man among them must take a dart
100,7,425,"with him to nurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is"
100,7,426,"leaping on board his ship, that others may fear to bring war and"
100,7,427,weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about
100,7,428,the city that the growing youths and grey - bearded men are to camp
100,7,429,upon its heaven - built walls. Let the women each of them light a
100,7,430,"great fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the"
100,7,431,"town be entered by surprise while the host is outside. See to it,"
100,7,432,"brave Trojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the"
100,7,433,moment; at daybreak I will instruct you further. I pray in hope
100,7,434,to Jove and to the gods that we may then drive those fate - sped
100,7,435,"hounds from our land, for ’tis the fates that have borne them and"
100,7,436,"their ships hither. This night, therefore, let us keep watch, but"
100,7,437,with early morning let us put on our armour and rouse fierce war
100,7,438,at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall then know whether brave
100,7,439,Diomed the son of Tydeus will drive me back from the ships to the
100,7,440,"wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carry off his"
100,7,441,"bloodstained spoils. To - morrow let him show his mettle, abide my"
100,7,442,"spear if he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be among"
100,7,443,the first to fall and many another of his comrades round him.
100,7,444,Would that I were as sure of being immortal and never growing
100,7,445,"old, and of being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo, as I am"
100,7,446,that this day will bring evil to the Argives.”
100,7,447,Thus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took
100,7,448,"their sweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast"
100,7,449,each by his own chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and
100,7,450,"cattle from the city, they brought wine also and corn from their"
100,7,451,houses and gathered much wood. They then offered unblemished
100,7,452,"hecatombs to the immortals, and the wind carried the sweet savour"
100,7,453,"of sacrifice to heaven — but the blessed gods partook not thereof,"
100,7,454,for they bitterly hated Ilius with Priam and Priam’s people. Thus
100,7,455,high in hope they sat through the livelong night by the highways
100,7,456,"of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle. As when the stars"
100,7,457,"shine clear, and the moon is bright — there is not a breath of air,"
100,7,458,not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it stands out in
100,7,459,the ineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of heaven; the
100,7,460,stars can all of them be told and the heart of the shepherd is
100,7,461,glad — even thus shone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilius
100,7,462,midway between the ships and the river Xanthus. A thousand
100,7,463,"camp - fires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each there"
100,7,464,"sat fifty men, while the horses, champing oats and corn beside"
100,7,465,"their chariots, waited till dawn should come."
100,8,1,The Embassy to Achilles.
100,8,2,"Thus did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood - stained"
100,8,3,"Rout, had taken fast hold of the Achaeans, and their princes were"
100,8,4,all of them in despair. As when the two winds that blow from
100,8,5,Thrace — the north and the northwest — spring up of a sudden and
100,8,6,rouse the fury of the main — in a moment the dark waves uprear
100,8,7,their heads and scatter their sea - wrack in all directions — even
100,8,8,thus troubled were the hearts of the Achaeans.
100,8,9,The son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a
100,8,10,"council man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made"
100,8,11,"haste also himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in"
100,8,12,their assembly. Agamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream
100,8,13,"or cataract on the side of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many"
100,8,14,"a heavy sigh he spoke to the Achaeans. “My friends,” said he,"
100,8,15,"“princes and councillors of the Argives, the hand of heaven has"
100,8,16,been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise
100,8,17,"that I should sack the city of Troy before returning, but he has"
100,8,18,"played me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to"
100,8,19,"Argos with the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who"
100,8,20,"has laid many a proud city in the dust as he will yet lay others,"
100,8,21,"for his power is above all. Now, therefore, let us all do as I"
100,8,22,"say and sail back to our own country, for we shall not take"
100,8,23,Troy.”
100,8,24,"Thus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat"
100,8,25,"sorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last"
100,8,26,"Diomed of the loud battle - cry made answer saying, “Son of Atreus,"
100,8,27,"I will chide your folly, as is my right in council. Be not then"
100,8,28,aggrieved that I should do so. In the first place you attacked me
100,8,29,before all the Danaans and said that I was a coward and no
100,8,30,soldier. The Argives young and old know that you did so. But the
100,8,31,son of scheming Saturn endowed you by halves only. He gave you
100,8,32,"honour as the chief ruler over us, but valour, which is the"
100,8,33,"highest both right and might he did not give you. Sir, think you"
100,8,34,that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and
100,8,35,cowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon going
100,8,36,home — go — the way is open to you; the many ships that followed you
100,8,37,from Mycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us
100,8,38,stay here till we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should
100,8,39,"turn homeward with their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still"
100,8,40,"fight on till we reach the goal of Ilius, for heaven was with us"
100,8,41,when we came.”
100,8,42,"The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed,"
100,8,43,"and presently Nestor rose to speak. “Son of Tydeus,” said he, “in"
100,8,44,"war your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all"
100,8,45,who are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light
100,8,46,"of what you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the"
100,8,47,end of the whole matter. You are still young — you might be the
100,8,48,youngest of my own children — still you have spoken wisely and have
100,8,49,counselled the chief of the Achaeans not without discretion;
100,8,50,nevertheless I am older than you and I will tell you everything;
100,8,51,"therefore let no man, not even King Agamemnon, disregard my"
100,8,52,"saying, for he that foments civil discord is a clanless,"
100,8,53,hearthless outlaw.
100,8,54,"“Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our"
100,8,55,"suppers, but let the sentinels every man of them camp by the"
100,8,56,trench that is without the wall. I am giving these instructions
100,8,57,"to the young men; when they have been attended to, do you, son of"
100,8,58,"Atreus, give your orders, for you are the most royal among us"
100,8,59,all. Prepare a feast for your councillors; it is right and
100,8,60,reasonable that you should do so; there is abundance of wine in
100,8,61,"your tents, which the ships of the Achaeans bring from Thrace"
100,8,62,daily. You have everything at your disposal wherewith to
100,8,63,"entertain guests, and you have many subjects. When many are got"
100,8,64,"together, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest — and"
100,8,65,"sorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit"
100,8,66,his watchfires hard by our ships. Who can be other than dismayed?
100,8,67,"This night will either be the ruin of our host, or save it.”"
100,8,68,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The"
100,8,69,sentinels went out in their armour under command of Nestor’s son
100,8,70,"Thrasymedes, a captain of the host, and of the bold warriors"
100,8,71,"Ascalaphus and Ialmenus: there were also Meriones, Aphareus and"
100,8,72,"Deipyrus, and the son of Creion, noble Lycomedes. There were"
100,8,73,"seven captains of the sentinels, and with each there went a"
100,8,74,hundred youths armed with long spears: they took their places
100,8,75,"midway between the trench and the wall, and when they had done so"
100,8,76,they lit their fires and got every man his supper.
100,8,77,The son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to
100,8,78,his quarters and prepared a great feast in their honour. They
100,8,79,"laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as"
100,8,80,"soon as they had enough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose"
100,8,81,"counsel was ever truest, was the first to lay his mind before"
100,8,82,"them. He, therefore, with all sincerity and goodwill addressed"
100,8,83,them thus.
100,8,84,"“With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,"
100,8,85,"will I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over"
100,8,86,"much people. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the"
100,8,87,"sceptre and to uphold righteousness, that you may take thought"
100,8,88,for your people under you; therefore it behooves you above all
100,8,89,"others both to speak and to give ear, and to out the counsel of"
100,8,90,another who shall have been minded to speak wisely. All turns on
100,8,91,"you and on your commands, therefore I will say what I think will"
100,8,92,be best. No man will be of a truer mind than that which has been
100,8,93,"mine from the hour when you, sir, angered Achilles by taking the"
100,8,94,girl Briseis from his tent against my judgment. I urged you not
100,8,95,"to do so, but you yielded to your own pride, and dishonoured a"
100,8,96,hero whom heaven itself had honoured — for you still hold the prize
100,8,97,"that had been awarded to him. Now, however, let us think how we"
100,8,98,"may appease him, both with presents and fair speeches that may"
100,8,99,conciliate him.”
100,8,100,"And King Agamemnon answered, “Sir, you have reproved my folly"
100,8,101,justly. I was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in
100,8,102,"himself a host, and Jove has shown that he befriends this man by"
100,8,103,destroying much people of the Achaeans. I was blinded with
100,8,104,passion and yielded to my worser mind; therefore I will make
100,8,105,"amends, and will give him great gifts by way of atonement. I will"
100,8,106,tell them in the presence of you all. I will give him seven
100,8,107,"tripods that have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of"
100,8,108,gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons and twelve strong
100,8,109,"horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich, indeed,"
100,8,110,both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as my horses
100,8,111,"have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians,"
100,8,112,whom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos — all of surpassing
100,8,113,"beauty. I will give him these, and with them her whom I erewhile"
100,8,114,"took from him, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a great oath"
100,8,115,"that I never went up into her couch, nor have been with her after"
100,8,116,the manner of men and women.
100,8,117,"“All these things will I give him now, and if hereafter the gods"
100,8,118,"vouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when we"
100,8,119,"Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and"
100,8,120,bronze to his liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan
100,8,121,"women, the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach"
100,8,122,"Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all lands, he shall be my son - in - law"
100,8,123,"and I will show him like honour with my own dear son Orestes, who"
100,8,124,"is being nurtured in all abundance. I have three daughters,"
100,8,125,"Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa, let him take the one of"
100,8,126,"his choice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of"
100,8,127,Peleus; I will add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his
100,8,128,"daughter, and will give him seven well established cities,"
100,8,129,"Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where there is grass; holy Pherae and"
100,8,130,"the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine - clad slopes"
100,8,131,"of Pedasus, all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos."
100,8,132,The men that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will
100,8,133,"honour him with gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to"
100,8,134,his comfortable ordinances. All this will I do if he will now
100,8,135,forgo his anger. Let him then yield; it is only Hades who is
100,8,136,utterly ruthless and unyielding — and hence he is of all gods the
100,8,137,one most hateful to mankind. Moreover I am older and more royal
100,8,138,"than himself. Therefore, let him now obey me.”"
100,8,139,"Then Nestor answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,"
100,8,140,"Agamemnon. The gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then"
100,8,141,"send chosen messengers, who may go to the tent of Achilles son of"
100,8,142,Peleus without delay. Let those go whom I shall name. Let
100,8,143,"Phoenix, dear to Jove, lead the way; let Ajax and Ulysses follow,"
100,8,144,and let the heralds Odius and Eurybates go with them. Now bring
100,8,145,"water for our hands, and bid all keep silence while we pray to"
100,8,146,"Jove the son of Saturn, if so be that he may have mercy upon us.”"
100,8,147,"Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men - servants"
100,8,148,"poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the"
100,8,149,"mixing - bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after"
100,8,150,"giving every man his drink - offering; then, when they had made"
100,8,151,"their offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the"
100,8,152,envoys set out from the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and
100,8,153,"Nestor, looking first to one and then to another, but most"
100,8,154,"especially at Ulysses, was instant with them that they should"
100,8,155,prevail with the noble son of Peleus.
100,8,156,"They went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed"
100,8,157,earnestly to earth - encircling Neptune that the high spirit of the
100,8,158,son of Aeacus might incline favourably towards them. When they
100,8,159,"reached the ships and tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles"
100,8,160,"playing on a lyre, fair, of cunning workmanship, and its"
100,8,161,cross - bar was of silver. It was part of the spoils which he had
100,8,162,"taken when he sacked the city of Eetion, and he was now diverting"
100,8,163,himself with it and singing the feats of heroes. He was alone
100,8,164,"with Patroclus, who sat opposite to him and said nothing, waiting"
100,8,165,till he should cease singing. Ulysses and Ajax now came
100,8,166,in — Ulysses leading the way — and stood before him. Achilles sprang
100,8,167,"from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and Patroclus,"
100,8,168,"when he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greeted them"
100,8,169,"saying, “All hail and welcome — you must come upon some great"
100,8,170,"matter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of the"
100,8,171,Achaeans.”
100,8,172,"With this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered"
100,8,173,"with purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him,"
100,8,174,"“Son of Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less"
100,8,175,"water with the wine, and give every man his cup, for these are"
100,8,176,"very dear friends, who are now under my roof.”"
100,8,177,Patroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping - block
100,8,178,"in front of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the"
100,8,179,"loin also of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held"
100,8,180,the meat while Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and
100,8,181,put them on spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn
100,8,182,"high. When the flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid"
100,8,183,"the spits on top of them, lifting them up and setting them upon"
100,8,184,the spit - racks; and he sprinkled them with salt. When the meat
100,8,185,"was roasted, he set it on platters, and handed bread round the"
100,8,186,"table in fair baskets, while Achilles dealt them their portions."
100,8,187,Then Achilles took his seat facing Ulysses against the opposite
100,8,188,"wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus offer sacrifice to the gods;"
100,8,189,"so he cast the offerings into the fire, and they laid their hands"
100,8,190,upon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had
100,8,191,"had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made a sign to Phoenix, and"
100,8,192,"when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup with wine and pledged"
100,8,193,Achilles.
100,8,194,"“Hail,” said he, “Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer,"
100,8,195,"neither in the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been"
100,8,196,"plenty to eat and drink, but our thought turns upon no such"
100,8,197,"matter. Sir, we are in the face of great disaster, and without"
100,8,198,your help know not whether we shall save our fleet or lose it.
100,8,199,The Trojans and their allies have camped hard by our ships and by
100,8,200,the wall; they have lit watchfires throughout their host and deem
100,8,201,that nothing can now prevent them from falling on our fleet.
100,8,202,"Jove, moreover, has sent his lightnings on their right; Hector,"
100,8,203,"in all his glory, rages like a maniac; confident that Jove is"
100,8,204,"with him he fears neither god nor man, but is gone raving mad,"
100,8,205,and prays for the approach of day. He vows that he will hew the
100,8,206,"high sterns of our ships in pieces, set fire to their hulls, and"
100,8,207,make havoc of the Achaeans while they are dazed and smothered in
100,8,208,"smoke; I much fear that heaven will make good his boasting, and"
100,8,209,it will prove our lot to perish at Troy far from our home in
100,8,210,"Argos. Up, then, and late though it be, save the sons of the"
100,8,211,Achaeans who faint before the fury of the Trojans. You will
100,8,212,"repent bitterly hereafter if you do not, for when the harm is"
100,8,213,"done there will be no curing it; consider ere it be too late, and"
100,8,214,save the Danaans from destruction.
100,8,215,"“My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to"
100,8,216,"Agamemnon, did he not charge you saying, ‘Son, Minerva and Juno"
100,8,217,"will make you strong if they choose, but check your high temper,"
100,8,218,"for the better part is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and"
100,8,219,the Achaeans old and young will respect you more for doing so.’
100,8,220,"These were his words, but you have forgotten them. Even now,"
100,8,221,"however, be appeased, and put away your anger from you. Agamemnon"
100,8,222,"will make you great amends if you will forgive him; listen, and I"
100,8,223,will tell you what he has said in his tent that he will give you.
100,8,224,He will give you seven tripods that have never yet been on the
100,8,225,"fire, and ten talents of gold; twenty iron cauldrons, and twelve"
100,8,226,strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich
100,8,227,indeed both in land and gold is he who has as many prizes as
100,8,228,these horses have won for Agamemnon. Moreover he will give you
100,8,229,"seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he chose for himself,"
100,8,230,when you took Lesbos — all of surpassing beauty. He will give you
100,8,231,"these, and with them her whom he erewhile took from you, the"
100,8,232,"daughter of Briseus, and he will swear a great oath, he has never"
100,8,233,gone up into her couch nor been with her after the manner of men
100,8,234,"and women. All these things will he give you now down, and if"
100,8,235,"hereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you"
100,8,236,"can come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load your"
100,8,237,ship with gold and bronze to your liking. You can take twenty
100,8,238,"Trojan women, the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we"
100,8,239,"reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his"
100,8,240,"son - in - law, and he will show you like honour with his own dear"
100,8,241,"son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance. Agamemnon"
100,8,242,"has three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa; you"
100,8,243,"may take the one of your choice, freely and without gifts of"
100,8,244,"wooing, to the house of Peleus; he will add such dower to boot as"
100,8,245,"no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will give you seven"
100,8,246,"well - established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire where there"
100,8,247,"is grass; holy Pherae and the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also,"
100,8,248,"and the vine - clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, and on the"
100,8,249,borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in
100,8,250,cattle and sheep; they will honour you with gifts as though were
100,8,251,"a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. All this"
100,8,252,"will he do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though you"
100,8,253,"hate both him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the"
100,8,254,rest of the Achaeans who are being harassed in all their host;
100,8,255,"they will honour you as a god, and you will earn great glory at"
100,8,256,their hands. You might even kill Hector; he will come within your
100,8,257,"reach, for he is infatuated, and declares that not a Danaan whom"
100,8,258,the ships have brought can hold his own against him.”
100,8,259,"Achilles answered, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give"
100,8,260,you formal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there
100,8,261,"be no more of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come."
100,8,262,Him do I hate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while
100,8,263,he hides another in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean.
100,8,264,I will be appeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any
100,8,265,"other of the Danaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my"
100,8,266,fighting. He that fights fares no better than he that does not;
100,8,267,"coward and hero are held in equal honour, and death deals like"
100,8,268,measure to him who works and him who is idle. I have taken
100,8,269,nothing by all my hardships — with my life ever in my hand; as a
100,8,270,"bird when she has found a morsel takes it to her nestlings, and"
100,8,271,"herself fares hardly, even so many a long night have I been"
100,8,272,"wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by day against"
100,8,273,those who were fighting for their women. With my ships I have
100,8,274,"taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed"
100,8,275,with my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one
100,8,276,"of them, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed"
100,8,277,"where he was by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave"
100,8,278,"little, and kept much himself."
100,8,279,“Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the
100,8,280,"chieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone of"
100,8,281,the Achaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted — let him
100,8,282,"keep her and sleep with her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs"
100,8,283,fight the Trojans? What made the son of Atreus gather the host
100,8,284,and bring them? Was it not for the sake of Helen? Are the sons of
100,8,285,Atreus the only men in the world who love their wives? Any man of
100,8,286,"common right feeling will love and cherish her who is his own, as"
100,8,287,"I this woman, with my whole heart, though she was but a fruitling"
100,8,288,of my spear. Agamemnon has taken her from me; he has played me
100,8,289,"false; I know him; let him tempt me no further, for he shall not"
100,8,290,"move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses, and to the other princes"
100,8,291,to save his ships from burning. He has done much without me
100,8,292,already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep and wide
100,8,293,"all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but even"
100,8,294,so he stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as I
100,8,295,fought the Achaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from
100,8,296,the city walls; he would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak
100,8,297,"tree, but no further. Once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he"
100,8,298,"escape my onset: now, however, since I am in no mood to fight"
100,8,299,"him, I will to - morrow offer sacrifice to Jove and to all the"
100,8,300,gods; I will draw my ships into the water and then victual them
100,8,301,"duly; to - morrow morning, if you care to look, you will see my"
100,8,302,"ships on the Hellespont, and my men rowing out to sea with might"
100,8,303,"and main. If great Neptune vouchsafes me a fair passage, in three"
100,8,304,days I shall be in Phthia. I have much there that I left behind
100,8,305,"me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shall bring back still"
100,8,306,"further store of gold, of red copper, of fair women, and of iron,"
100,8,307,"my share of the spoils that we have taken; but one prize, he who"
100,8,308,"gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I now bid you,"
100,8,309,and tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him and beware
100,8,310,of him should he think that he can yet dupe others for his
100,8,311,effrontery never fails him.
100,8,312,"“As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I"
100,8,313,"will take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in"
100,8,314,"common with him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he"
100,8,315,"shall not cozen me further; let him go his own way, for Jove has"
100,8,316,"robbed him of his reason. I loathe his presents, and for himself"
100,8,317,care not one straw. He may offer me ten or even twenty times what
100,8,318,"he has now done, nay — not though it be all that he has in the"
100,8,319,"world, both now or ever shall have; he may promise me the wealth"
100,8,320,"of Orchomenus or of Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in"
100,8,321,"the whole world, for it has a hundred gates through each of which"
100,8,322,two hundred men may drive at once with their chariots and horses;
100,8,323,he may offer me gifts as the sands of the sea or the dust of the
100,8,324,"plain in multitude, but even so he shall not move me till I have"
100,8,325,been revenged in full for the bitter wrong he has done me. I will
100,8,326,"not marry his daughter; she may be fair as Venus, and skilful as"
100,8,327,"Minerva, but I will have none of her: let another take her, who"
100,8,328,may be a good match for her and who rules a larger kingdom. If
100,8,329,"the gods spare me to return home, Peleus will find me a wife;"
100,8,330,"there are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia, daughters of kings"
100,8,331,that have cities under them; of these I can take whom I will and
100,8,332,marry her. Many a time was I minded when at home in Phthia to woo
100,8,333,"and wed a woman who would make me a suitable wife, and to enjoy"
100,8,334,the riches of my old father Peleus. My life is more to me than
100,8,335,all the wealth of Ilius while it was yet at peace before the
100,8,336,"Achaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies on the"
100,8,337,stone floor of Apollo’s temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho.
100,8,338,"Cattle and sheep are to be had for harrying, and a man buy both"
100,8,339,"tripods and horses if he wants them, but when his life has once"
100,8,340,left him it can neither be bought nor harried back again.
100,8,341,“My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may
100,8,342,"meet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive"
100,8,343,but my name will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will
100,8,344,"die, but it will be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of"
100,8,345,"you, then, I say, ‘Go home, for you will not take Ilius.’ Jove"
100,8,346,"has held his hand over her to protect her, and her people have"
100,8,347,"taken heart. Go, therefore, as in duty bound, and tell the"
100,8,348,princes of the Achaeans the message that I have sent them; tell
100,8,349,them to find some other plan for the saving of their ships and
100,8,350,"people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the one that they"
100,8,351,"have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him sleep here"
100,8,352,that he may sail with me in the morning if he so will. But I will
100,8,353,not take him by force.”
100,8,354,"They all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which"
100,8,355,"he had denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his"
100,8,356,"great fear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and"
100,8,357,"said, “Noble Achilles, if you are now minded to return, and in"
100,8,358,the fierceness of your anger will do nothing to save the ships
100,8,359,"from burning, how, my son, can I remain here without you? Your"
100,8,360,father Peleus bade me go with you when he sent you as a mere lad
100,8,361,from Phthia to Agamemnon. You knew nothing neither of war nor of
100,8,362,"the arts whereby men make their mark in council, and he sent me"
100,8,363,with you to train you in all excellence of speech and action.
100,8,364,"Therefore, my son, I will not stay here without you — no, not"
100,8,365,"though heaven itself vouchsafe to strip my years from off me, and"
100,8,366,make me young as I was when I first left Hellas the land of fair
100,8,367,"women. I was then flying the anger of father Amyntor, son of"
100,8,368,"Ormenus, who was furious with me in the matter of his concubine,"
100,8,369,of whom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother.
100,8,370,"My mother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the"
100,8,371,"woman myself, that so she hate my father, and in the course of"
100,8,372,"time I yielded. But my father soon came to know, and cursed me"
100,8,373,"bitterly, calling the dread Erinyes to witness. He prayed that no"
100,8,374,"son of mine might ever sit upon knees — and the gods, Jove of the"
100,8,375,"world below and awful Proserpine, fulfilled his curse. I took"
100,8,376,"counsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me"
100,8,377,think on men’s evil tongues and how I should be branded as the
100,8,378,murderer of my father; nevertheless I could not bear to stay in
100,8,379,my father’s house with him so bitter against me. My cousins and
100,8,380,"clansmen came about me, and pressed me sorely to remain; many a"
100,8,381,"sheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog did"
100,8,382,"they set down to roast before the fire; many a jar, too, did they"
100,8,383,broach of my father’s wine. Nine whole nights did they set a
100,8,384,"guard over me taking it in turns to watch, and they kept a fire"
100,8,385,"always burning, both in the cloister of the outer court and in"
100,8,386,the inner court at the doors of the room wherein I lay; but when
100,8,387,"the darkness of the tenth night came, I broke through the closed"
100,8,388,"doors of my room, and climbed the wall of the outer court after"
100,8,389,passing quickly and unperceived through the men on guard and the
100,8,390,women servants. I then fled through Hellas till I came to fertile
100,8,391,"Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King Peleus, who made me welcome"
100,8,392,and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heir to
100,8,393,"all his wealth. He made me rich and set me over much people,"
100,8,394,establishing me on the borders of Phthia where I was chief ruler
100,8,395,over the Dolopians.
100,8,396,"“It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with"
100,8,397,all my heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had
100,8,398,"gone out elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut"
100,8,399,"up the dainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine - cup"
100,8,400,to your lips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby
100,8,401,"helplessness over my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but"
100,8,402,"I knew that heaven had vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and"
100,8,403,"I made a son of you, Achilles, that in my hour of need you might"
100,8,404,"protect me. Now, therefore, I say battle with your pride and beat"
100,8,405,it; cherish not your anger for ever; the might and majesty of
100,8,406,"heaven are more than ours, but even heaven may be appeased; and"
100,8,407,"if a man has sinned he prays the gods, and reconciles them to"
100,8,408,"himself by his piteous cries and by frankincense, with"
100,8,409,drink - offerings and the savour of burnt sacrifice. For prayers
100,8,410,"are as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes"
100,8,411,"askance, they follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being fierce"
100,8,412,"and fleet of foot, leaves them far behind him, and ever baneful"
100,8,413,to mankind outstrips them even to the ends of the world; but
100,8,414,nevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healing after. If a
100,8,415,man has pity upon these daughters of Jove when they draw near
100,8,416,"him, they will bless him and hear him too when he is praying; but"
100,8,417,"if he deny them and will not listen to them, they go to Jove the"
100,8,418,son of Saturn and pray that he may presently fall into sin — to his
100,8,419,"ruing bitterly hereafter. Therefore, Achilles, give these"
100,8,420,"daughters of Jove due reverence, and bow before them as all good"
100,8,421,men will bow. Were not the son of Atreus offering you gifts and
100,8,422,promising others later — if he were still furious and implacable — I
100,8,423,am not he that would bid you throw off your anger and help the
100,8,424,"Achaeans, no matter how great their need; but he is giving much"
100,8,425,"now, and more hereafter; he has sent his captains to urge his"
100,8,426,"suit, and has chosen those who of all the Argives are most"
100,8,427,acceptable to you; make not then their words and their coming to
100,8,428,be of none effect. Your anger has been righteous so far. We have
100,8,429,heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when they were
100,8,430,"roused to fury, but still they could be won by gifts, and fair"
100,8,431,words could soothe them.
100,8,432,“I have an old story in my mind — a very old one — but you are all
100,8,433,friends and I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians were
100,8,434,fighting and killing one another round Calydon — the Aetolians
100,8,435,defending the city and the Curetes trying to destroy it. For
100,8,436,Diana of the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because
100,8,437,Oeneus had not offered her his harvest first - fruits. The other
100,8,438,"gods had all been feasted with hecatombs, but to the daughter of"
100,8,439,"great Jove alone he had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten her,"
100,8,440,"or somehow or other it had escaped him, and this was a grievous"
100,8,441,sin. Thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure sent a
100,8,442,prodigious creature against him — a savage wild boar with great
100,8,443,"white tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands, uprooting"
100,8,444,apple - trees in full bloom and throwing them to the ground. But
100,8,445,Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities
100,8,446,"and killed it — for it was so monstrous that not a few were needed,"
100,8,447,and many a man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this the
100,8,448,goddess set the Curetes and the Aetolians fighting furiously
100,8,449,about the head and skin of the boar.
100,8,450,“So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the
100,8,451,"Curetes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their"
100,8,452,ground under the city walls; but in the course of time Meleager
100,8,453,was angered as even a wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed
100,8,454,"with his mother Althaea, and therefore stayed at home with his"
100,8,455,"wedded wife fair Cleopatra, who was daughter of Marpessa daughter"
100,8,456,"of Euenus, and of Ides the man then living. He it was who took"
100,8,457,his bow and faced King Apollo himself for fair Marpessa’s sake;
100,8,458,"her father and mother then named her Alcyone, because her mother"
100,8,459,had mourned with the plaintive strains of the halcyon - bird when
100,8,460,"Phoebus Apollo had carried her off. Meleager, then, stayed at"
100,8,461,"home with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt by reason of"
100,8,462,"his mother’s curses. His mother, grieving for the death of her"
100,8,463,"brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with her hands,"
100,8,464,calling upon Hades and on awful Proserpine; she went down upon
100,8,465,her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed that
100,8,466,they would kill her son — and Erinys that walks in darkness and
100,8,467,knows no ruth heard her from Erebus.
100,8,468,"“Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and"
100,8,469,the dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon the
100,8,470,elders of the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest
100,8,471,"of their priests, and begged him to come out and help them,"
100,8,472,promising him a great reward. They bade him choose fifty
100,8,473,"plough - gates, the most fertile in the plain of Calydon, the"
100,8,474,one - half vineyard and the other open plough - land. The old warrior
100,8,475,"Oeneus implored him, standing at the threshold of his room and"
100,8,476,beating the doors in supplication. His sisters and his mother
100,8,477,"herself besought him sore, but he the more refused them; those of"
100,8,478,"his comrades who were nearest and dearest to him also prayed him,"
100,8,479,but they could not move him till the foe was battering at the
100,8,480,"very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaled the walls"
100,8,481,and were setting fire to the city. Then at last his sorrowing
100,8,482,wife detailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken;
100,8,483,"she reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given"
100,8,484,"over to the flames, while the women and children are carried into"
100,8,485,"captivity; when he heard all this, his heart was touched, and he"
100,8,486,donned his armour to go forth. Thus of his own inward motion he
100,8,487,saved the city of the Aetolians; but they now gave him nothing of
100,8,488,"those rich rewards that they had offered earlier, and though he"
100,8,489,"saved the city he took nothing by it. Be not then, my son, thus"
100,8,490,minded; let not heaven lure you into any such course. When the
100,8,491,ships are burning it will be a harder matter to save them. Take
100,8,492,"the gifts, and go, for the Achaeans will then honour you as a"
100,8,493,"god; whereas if you fight without taking them, you may beat the"
100,8,494,"battle back, but you will not be held in like honour.”"
100,8,495,"And Achilles answered, “Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no"
100,8,496,"need of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will"
100,8,497,"abide with me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my"
100,8,498,limbs are strong. I say further — and lay my saying to your
100,8,499,"heart — vex me no more with this weeping and lamentation, all in"
100,8,500,"the cause of the son of Atreus. Love him so well, and you may"
100,8,501,lose the love I bear you. You ought to help me rather in
100,8,502,"troubling those that trouble me; be king as much as I am, and"
100,8,503,share like honour with myself; the others shall take my answer;
100,8,504,stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed; at daybreak
100,8,505,we will consider whether to remain or go.”
100,8,506,On this he nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to
100,8,507,"prepare a bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take their"
100,8,508,"leave. Ajax son of Telamon then said, “Ulysses, noble son of"
100,8,509,"Laertes, let us be gone, for I see that our journey is vain. We"
100,8,510,"must now take our answer, unwelcome though it be, to the Danaans"
100,8,511,who are waiting to receive it. Achilles is savage and
100,8,512,"remorseless; he is cruel, and cares nothing for the love his"
100,8,513,comrades lavished upon him more than on all the others. He is
100,8,514,implacable — and yet if a man’s brother or son has been slain he
100,8,515,"will accept a fine by way of amends from him that killed him, and"
100,8,516,the wrong - doer having paid in full remains in peace among his own
100,8,517,"people; but as for you, Achilles, the gods have put a wicked"
100,8,518,"unforgiving spirit in your heart, and this, all about one single"
100,8,519,"girl, whereas we now offer you the seven best we have, and much"
100,8,520,"else into the bargain. Be then of a more gracious mind, respect"
100,8,521,the hospitality of your own roof. We are with you as messengers
100,8,522,"from the host of the Danaans, and would fain be held nearest and"
100,8,523,dearest to yourself of all the Achaeans.”
100,8,524,"“Ajax,” replied Achilles, “noble son of Telamon, you have spoken"
100,8,525,"much to my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over,"
100,8,526,and remember how the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as
100,8,527,"though I were some vile tramp, and that too in the presence of"
100,8,528,"the Argives. Go, then, and deliver your message; say that I will"
100,8,529,"have no concern with fighting till Hector, son of noble Priam,"
100,8,530,"reaches the tents of the Myrmidons in his murderous course, and"
100,8,531,"flings fire upon their ships. For all his lust of battle, I take"
100,8,532,it he will be held in check when he is at my own tent and ship.”
100,8,533,"On this they took every man his double cup, made their"
100,8,534,"drink - offerings, and went back to the ships, Ulysses leading the"
100,8,535,way. But Patroclus told his men and the maid - servants to make
100,8,536,ready a comfortable bed for Phoenix; they therefore did so with
100,8,537,"sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet of fine linen. The old man then"
100,8,538,laid himself down and waited till morning came. But Achilles
100,8,539,"slept in an inner room, and beside him the daughter of Phorbas"
100,8,540,"lovely Diomede, whom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroclus"
100,8,541,"lay on the other side of the room, and with him fair Iphis whom"
100,8,542,Achilles had given him when he took Scyros the city of Enyeus.
100,8,543,"When the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the"
100,8,544,"Achaeans rose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to"
100,8,545,"question them. King Agamemnon was the first to do so. “Tell me,"
100,8,546,"Ulysses,” said he, “will he save the ships from burning, or did"
100,8,547,"he refuse, and is he still furious?”"
100,8,548,"Ulysses answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,"
100,8,549,"Agamemnon, Achilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely"
100,8,550,"angry than ever, and spurns both you and your gifts. He bids you"
100,8,551,take counsel with the Achaeans to save the ships and host as you
100,8,552,"best may; as for himself, he said that at daybreak he should draw"
100,8,553,his ships into the water. He said further that he should advise
100,8,554,"every one to sail home likewise, for that you will not reach the"
100,8,555,"goal of Ilius. ‘Jove,’ he said, ‘has laid his hand over the city"
100,8,556,"to protect it, and the people have taken heart.’ This is what he"
100,8,557,"said, and the others who were with me can tell you the same"
100,8,558,"story — Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, who may be"
100,8,559,"trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep, for so"
100,8,560,"Achilles would have it, that he might go home with him in the"
100,8,561,morning if he so would; but he will not take him by force.”
100,8,562,"They all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and"
100,8,563,"dejected, by reason of the sternness with which Achilles had"
100,8,564,"refused them, till presently Diomed said, “Most noble son of"
100,8,565,"Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, you ought not to have sued the"
100,8,566,"son of Peleus nor offered him gifts. He is proud enough as it is,"
100,8,567,and you have encouraged him in his pride still further. Let him
100,8,568,stay or go as he will. He will fight later when he is in the
100,8,569,"humour, and heaven puts it in his mind to do so. Now, therefore,"
100,8,570,"let us all do as I say; we have eaten and drunk our fill, let us"
100,8,571,"then take our rest, for in rest there is both strength and stay."
100,8,572,"But when fair rosy - fingered morn appears, forthwith bring out"
100,8,573,"your host and your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them"
100,8,574,"on, and yourself fighting among the foremost.”"
100,8,575,"Thus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They"
100,8,576,then made their drink - offerings and went every man to his own
100,8,577,"tent, where they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep."
100,9,1,"Ulysses and Diomed go out as spies, and meet Dolon, who gives"
100,9,2,"them information: they then kill him, and profiting by what he"
100,9,3,"had told them, kill Rhesus king of the Thracians and take his"
100,9,4,horses.
100,9,5,Now the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole
100,9,6,"night through, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that"
100,9,7,he could get no rest. As when fair Juno’s lord flashes his
100,9,8,lightning in token of great rain or hail or snow when the
100,9,9,"snow - flakes whiten the ground, or again as a sign that he will"
100,9,10,"open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so did Agamemnon heave"
100,9,11,"many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within him. When he"
100,9,12,looked upon the plain of Troy he marvelled at the many watchfires
100,9,13,"burning in front of Ilius, and at the sound of pipes and flutes"
100,9,14,"and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards the"
100,9,15,"ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls"
100,9,16,"before Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness"
100,9,17,of his soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at once to Nestor
100,9,18,"son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find any way of"
100,9,19,"the Achaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his"
100,9,20,"shirt, bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of"
100,9,21,a huge tawny lion over his shoulders — a skin that reached his
100,9,22,feet — and took his spear in his hand.
100,9,23,"Neither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the"
100,9,24,Argives who for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to
100,9,25,fight the Trojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a
100,9,26,"spotted panther, put a casque of bronze upon his head, and took"
100,9,27,"his spear in his brawny hand. Then he went to rouse his brother,"
100,9,28,"who was by far the most powerful of the Achaeans, and was"
100,9,29,honoured by the people as though he were a god. He found him by
100,9,30,the stern of his ship already putting his goodly array about his
100,9,31,"shoulders, and right glad was he that his brother had come."
100,9,32,"Menelaus spoke first. “Why,” said he, “my dear brother, are you"
100,9,33,thus arming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit
100,9,34,"the Trojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service,"
100,9,35,and spy upon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a
100,9,36,deed of great daring.”
100,9,37,"And King Agamemnon answered, “Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd"
100,9,38,"counsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed"
100,9,39,"his mind, and inclines towards Hector’s sacrifices rather than"
100,9,40,ours. I never saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought
100,9,41,such ruin in one day as Hector has now wrought against the sons
100,9,42,"of the Achaeans — and that too of his own unaided self, for he is"
100,9,43,son neither to god nor goddess. The Argives will rue it long and
100,9,44,"deeply. Run, therefore, with all speed by the line of the ships,"
100,9,45,"and call Ajax and Idomeneus. Meanwhile I will go to Nestor, and"
100,9,46,bid him rise and go about among the companies of our sentinels to
100,9,47,give them their instructions; they will listen to him sooner than
100,9,48,"to any man, for his own son, and Meriones brother in arms to"
100,9,49,"Idomeneus, are captains over them. It was to them more"
100,9,50,particularly that we gave this charge.”
100,9,51,"Menelaus replied, “How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with"
100,9,52,"them and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I"
100,9,53,"have given your orders?” “Wait,” answered King Agamemnon, “for"
100,9,54,there are so many paths about the camp that we might miss one
100,9,55,"another. Call every man on your way, and bid him be stirring;"
100,9,56,"name him by his lineage and by his father’s name, give each all"
100,9,57,"titular observance, and stand not too much upon your own dignity;"
100,9,58,"we must take our full share of toil, for at our birth Jove laid"
100,9,59,this heavy burden upon us.”
100,9,60,"With these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went"
100,9,61,on to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his
100,9,62,tent hard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him — his
100,9,63,"shield, his two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the"
100,9,64,gleaming girdle with which the old man girded himself when he
100,9,65,armed to lead his people into battle — for his age stayed him not.
100,9,66,He raised himself on his elbow and looked up at Agamemnon. “Who
100,9,67,"is it,” said he, “that goes thus about the host and the ships"
100,9,68,"alone and in the dead of night, when men are sleeping? Are you"
100,9,69,looking for one of your mules or for some comrade? Do not stand
100,9,70,"there and say nothing, but speak. What is your business?”"
100,9,71,"And Agamemnon answered, “Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the"
100,9,72,"Achaean name, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has"
100,9,73,laid labour and sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and
100,9,74,my limbs carry me. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon
100,9,75,"my eyelids, but my heart is big with war and with the jeopardy of"
100,9,76,"the Achaeans. I am in great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea,"
100,9,77,and without sure counsel; my heart beats as though it would leap
100,9,78,"out of my body, and my limbs fail me. If then you can do"
100,9,79,anything — for you too cannot sleep — let us go the round of the
100,9,80,"watch, and see whether they are drowsy with toil and sleeping to"
100,9,81,the neglect of their duty. The enemy is encamped hard and we know
100,9,82,not but he may attack us by night.”
100,9,83,"Nestor replied, “Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,"
100,9,84,"Agamemnon, Jove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he"
100,9,85,will; he will have troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay
100,9,86,"aside his anger. I will go with you, and we will rouse others,"
100,9,87,"either the son of Tydeus, or Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the"
100,9,88,valiant son of Phyleus. Some one had also better go and call Ajax
100,9,89,"and King Idomeneus, for their ships are not near at hand but the"
100,9,90,"farthest of all. I cannot however refrain from blaming Menelaus,"
100,9,91,"much as I love him and respect him — and I will say so plainly,"
100,9,92,even at the risk of offending you — for sleeping and leaving all
100,9,93,this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about imploring
100,9,94,"aid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme"
100,9,95,danger.”
100,9,96,"And Agamemnon answered, “Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly,"
100,9,97,for he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself — not indeed
100,9,98,"from sloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and"
100,9,99,"expects me to take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was"
100,9,100,"awake before I was, and came to me of his own accord. I have"
100,9,101,already sent him to call the very men whom you have named. And
100,9,102,now let us be going. We shall find them with the watch outside
100,9,103,"the gates, for it was there I said that we would meet them.”"
100,9,104,"“In that case,” answered Nestor, “the Argives will not blame him"
100,9,105,nor disobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them
100,9,106,instructions.”
100,9,107,"With this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his"
100,9,108,"comely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses,"
100,9,109,"large, and of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable"
100,9,110,"bronze - shod spear, and wended his way along the line of the"
100,9,111,Achaean ships. First he called loudly to Ulysses peer of gods in
100,9,112,"counsel and woke him, for he was soon roused by the sound of the"
100,9,113,"battle - cry. He came outside his tent and said, “Why do you go"
100,9,114,"thus alone about the host, and along the line of the ships in the"
100,9,115,stillness of the night? What is it that you find so urgent?” And
100,9,116,"Nestor knight of Gerene answered, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,"
100,9,117,"take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits. Come"
100,9,118,"with me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us"
100,9,119,whether we shall fight or fly.”
100,9,120,"On this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about"
100,9,121,his shoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed
100,9,122,"son of Tydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour"
100,9,123,with his comrades sleeping round him and using their shields as
100,9,124,"pillows; as for their spears, they stood upright on the spikes of"
100,9,125,"their butts that were driven into the ground, and the burnished"
100,9,126,bronze flashed afar like the lightning of father Jove. The hero
100,9,127,"was sleeping upon the skin of an ox, with a piece of fine carpet"
100,9,128,under his head; Nestor went up to him and stirred him with his
100,9,129,"heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him to bestir"
100,9,130,"himself. “Wake up,” he exclaimed, “son of Tydeus. How can you"
100,9,131,sleep on in this way? Can you not see that the Trojans are
100,9,132,"encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships, with but a"
100,9,133,little space between us and them?”
100,9,134,"On these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, “Old man,"
100,9,135,your heart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours.
100,9,136,Are there no younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to
100,9,137,rouse the princes? There is no tiring you.”
100,9,138,"And Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, “My son, all that you"
100,9,139,"have said is true. I have good sons, and also much people who"
100,9,140,"might call the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest"
100,9,141,danger; life and death are balanced as it were on the edge of a
100,9,142,"razor. Go then, for you are younger than I, and of your courtesy"
100,9,143,rouse Ajax and the fleet son of Phyleus.”
100,9,144,Diomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders — a
100,9,145,skin that reached his feet — and grasped his spear. When he had
100,9,146,"roused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went"
100,9,147,"the round of those who were on guard, and found the captains not"
100,9,148,sleeping at their posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms
100,9,149,about them. As sheep dogs that watch their flocks when they are
100,9,150,"yarded, and hear a wild beast coming through the mountain forest"
100,9,151,"towards them — forthwith there is a hue and cry of dogs and men,"
100,9,152,and slumber is broken — even so was sleep chased from the eyes of
100,9,153,"the Achaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for"
100,9,154,they turned constantly towards the plain whenever they heard any
100,9,155,stir among the Trojans. The old man was glad and bade them be of
100,9,156,"good cheer. “Watch on, my children,” said he, “and let not sleep"
100,9,157,"get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us.”"
100,9,158,"With this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of"
100,9,159,the Achaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the
100,9,160,"brave son of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When"
100,9,161,they were beyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held
100,9,162,their meeting on the open ground where there was a space clear of
100,9,163,"corpses, for it was here that when night fell Hector had turned"
100,9,164,"back from his onslaught on the Argives. They sat down, therefore,"
100,9,165,and held debate with one another.
100,9,166,"Nestor spoke first. “My friends,” said he, “is there any man bold"
100,9,167,"enough to venture among the Trojans, and cut off some straggler,"
100,9,168,or bring us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will
100,9,169,"stay here by the ships away from the city, or whether, now that"
100,9,170,"they have worsted the Achaeans, they will retire within their"
100,9,171,"walls. If he could learn all this and come back safely here, his"
100,9,172,"fame would be high as heaven in the mouths of all men, and he"
100,9,173,would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs from all our ships would
100,9,174,each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb — which is a
100,9,175,present of surpassing value — and he would be asked as a guest to
100,9,176,all feasts and clan - gatherings.”
100,9,177,"They all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war - cry spoke"
100,9,178,"saying, “Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over"
100,9,179,"against us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in"
100,9,180,"greater confidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of"
100,9,181,them may see some opportunity which the other has not caught
100,9,182,"sight of; if a man is alone he is less full of resource, and his"
100,9,183,wit is weaker.”
100,9,184,"On this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes,"
100,9,185,"servants of Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to"
100,9,186,"go, so did Menelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go"
100,9,187,"among the host of the Trojans, for he was ever full of daring,"
100,9,188,"and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke thus: “Diomed,” said he,"
100,9,189,"“son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, choose your comrade for"
100,9,190,"yourself — take the best man of those that have offered, for many"
100,9,191,would now go with you. Do not through delicacy reject the better
100,9,192,"man, and take the worst out of respect for his lineage, because"
100,9,193,he is of more royal blood.”
100,9,194,"He said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, “If"
100,9,195,"you bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I"
100,9,196,"fail to think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to"
100,9,197,face all kinds of danger — and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he
100,9,198,"were to go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for"
100,9,199,he is quick to see and understand.”
100,9,200,"“Son of Tydeus,” replied Ulysses, “say neither good nor ill about"
100,9,201,"me, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going,"
100,9,202,for the night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone
100,9,203,"forward, two - thirds of the night are already spent, and the third"
100,9,204,is alone left us.”
100,9,205,They then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son
100,9,206,of Tydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at
100,9,207,his ship) and on his head he set a helmet of bull’s hide without
100,9,208,either peak or crest; it is called a skull - cap and is a common
100,9,209,"headgear. Meriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his"
100,9,210,head he set a leathern helmet that was lined with a strong
100,9,211,"plaiting of leathern thongs, while on the outside it was thickly"
100,9,212,"studded with boar’s teeth, well and skilfully set into it; next"
100,9,213,the head there was an inner lining of felt. This helmet had been
100,9,214,stolen by Autolycus out of Eleon when he broke into the house of
100,9,215,Amyntor son of Ormenus. He gave it to Amphidamas of Cythera to
100,9,216,"take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest - gift to Molus,"
100,9,217,who gave it to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon the head
100,9,218,of Ulysses.
100,9,219,"When the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other"
100,9,220,chieftains behind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the
100,9,221,wayside upon their right hands; they could not see it for the
100,9,222,"darkness, but they heard its cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard"
100,9,223,"it and prayed to Minerva: “Hear me,” he cried, “daughter of"
100,9,224,"aegis - bearing Jove, you who spy out all my ways and who are with"
100,9,225,"me in all my hardships; befriend me in this mine hour, and grant"
100,9,226,that we may return to the ships covered with glory after having
100,9,227,achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring sorrow to the
100,9,228,Trojans.”
100,9,229,"Then Diomed of the loud war - cry also prayed: “Hear me too,” said"
100,9,230,"he, “daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were"
100,9,231,with my noble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent
100,9,232,by the Achaeans. He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river
100,9,233,"Aesopus, and went to the city bearing a message of peace to the"
100,9,234,"Cadmeians; on his return thence, with your help, goddess, he did"
100,9,235,"great deeds of daring, for you were his ready helper. Even so"
100,9,236,"guide me and guard me now, and in return I will offer you in"
100,9,237,"sacrifice a broad - browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and"
100,9,238,never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns
100,9,239,and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.”
100,9,240,"Thus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When"
100,9,241,"they had done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went"
100,9,242,their way like two lions prowling by night amid the armour and
100,9,243,blood - stained bodies of them that had fallen.
100,9,244,Neither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called
100,9,245,the princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his
100,9,246,"counsel before them. “Is there one,” said he, “who for a great"
100,9,247,reward will do me the service of which I will tell you? He shall
100,9,248,be well paid if he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple
100,9,249,"of horses, the fleetest that can be found at the ships of the"
100,9,250,"Achaeans, if he will dare this thing; and he will win infinite"
100,9,251,honour to boot; he must go to the ships and find out whether they
100,9,252,"are still guarded as heretofore, or whether now that we have"
100,9,253,"beaten them the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer"
100,9,254,exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.”
100,9,255,They all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a
100,9,256,"certain man named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald — a man"
100,9,257,"rich in gold and bronze. He was ill - favoured, but a good runner,"
100,9,258,and was an only son among five sisters. He it was that now
100,9,259,"addressed the Trojans. “I, Hector,” said he, “Will to the ships"
100,9,260,and will exploit them. But first hold up your sceptre and swear
100,9,261,"that you will give me the chariot, bedight with bronze, and the"
100,9,262,horses that now carry the noble son of Peleus. I will make you a
100,9,263,"good scout, and will not fail you. I will go through the host"
100,9,264,"from one end to the other till I come to the ship of Agamemnon,"
100,9,265,where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are now consulting
100,9,266,whether they shall fight or fly.”
100,9,267,"When he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore"
100,9,268,"him his oath saying, “May Jove the thundering husband of Juno"
100,9,269,bear witness that no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those
100,9,270,"steeds, and that you shall have your will with them for ever.”"
100,9,271,"The oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on"
100,9,272,"going. He hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he"
100,9,273,"wore the skin of a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of"
100,9,274,"ferret skin. Then he took a pointed javelin, and left the camp"
100,9,275,"for the ships, but he was not to return with any news for Hector."
100,9,276,"When he had left the horses and the troops behind him, he made"
100,9,277,"all speed on his way, but Ulysses perceived his coming and said"
100,9,278,"to Diomed, “Diomed, here is some one from the camp; I am not sure"
100,9,279,"whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief who would"
100,9,280,"plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, we"
100,9,281,"can then spring upon him and take him. If, however, he is too"
100,9,282,"quick for us, go after him with your spear and hem him in towards"
100,9,283,"the ships away from the Trojan camp, to prevent his getting back"
100,9,284,to the town.”
100,9,285,With this they turned out of their way and lay down among the
100,9,286,"corpses. Dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when"
100,9,287,he had got about as far as the distance by which a mule - plowed
100,9,288,furrow exceeds one that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can
100,9,289,"plow fallow land quicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when"
100,9,290,"he heard their footsteps he stood still, for he made sure they"
100,9,291,were friends from the Trojan camp come by Hector’s orders to bid
100,9,292,"him return; when, however, they were only a spear’s cast, or"
100,9,293,"less, away from him, he saw that they were enemies and ran as"
100,9,294,"fast as his legs could take him. The others gave chase at once,"
100,9,295,and as a couple of well - trained hounds press forward after a doe
100,9,296,"or hare that runs screaming in front of them, even so did the son"
100,9,297,of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cut him off from his own
100,9,298,people. But when he had fled so far towards the ships that he
100,9,299,"would soon have fallen in with the outposts, Minerva infused"
100,9,300,fresh strength into the son of Tydeus for fear some other of the
100,9,301,"Achaeans might have the glory of being first to hit him, and he"
100,9,302,might himself be only second; he therefore sprang forward with
100,9,303,"his spear and said, “Stand, or I shall throw my spear, and in"
100,9,304,that case I shall soon make an end of you.”
100,9,305,"He threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart"
100,9,306,"flew over the man’s right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground."
100,9,307,"He stood stock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth"
100,9,308,"chattered, and he turned pale with fear. The two came breathless"
100,9,309,"up to him and seized his hands, whereon he began to weep and"
100,9,310,"said, “Take me alive; I will ransom myself; we have great store"
100,9,311,"of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this my father will"
100,9,312,"satisfy you with a very large ransom, should he hear of my being"
100,9,313,alive at the ships of the Achaeans.”
100,9,314,"“Fear not,” replied Ulysses, “let no thought of death be in your"
100,9,315,"mind; but tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about"
100,9,316,alone in the dead of night away from your camp and towards the
100,9,317,"ships, while other men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies"
100,9,318,"of the slain, or did Hector send you to spy out what was going on"
100,9,319,at the ships? Or did you come here of your own mere notion?”
100,9,320,"Dolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: “Hector, with"
100,9,321,"his vain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement."
100,9,322,He said he would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus
100,9,323,and his bronze - bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the
100,9,324,"darkness of the flying night, get close to the enemy, and find"
100,9,325,"out whether the ships are still guarded as heretofore, or"
100,9,326,"whether, now that we have beaten them, the Achaeans design to"
100,9,327,"fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their"
100,9,328,watches.”
100,9,329,"Ulysses smiled at him and answered, “You had indeed set your"
100,9,330,"heart upon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of"
100,9,331,Aeacus are hardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other
100,9,332,"mortal man than Achilles himself, whose mother was an immortal."
100,9,333,"But tell me, and tell me true, where did you leave Hector when"
100,9,334,"you started? Where lies his armour and his horses? How, too, are"
100,9,335,the watches and sleeping - ground of the Trojans ordered? What are
100,9,336,their plans? Will they stay here by the ships and away from the
100,9,337,"city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans, will they"
100,9,338,retire within their walls?”
100,9,339,"And Dolon answered, “I will tell you truly all. Hector and the"
100,9,340,other councillors are now holding conference by the monument of
100,9,341,"great Ilus, away from the general tumult; as for the guards about"
100,9,342,"which you ask me, there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the"
100,9,343,"host. The Trojans have their watchfires, for they are bound to"
100,9,344,"have them; they, therefore, are awake and keep each other to"
100,9,345,their duty as sentinels; but the allies who have come from other
100,9,346,"places are asleep and leave it to the Trojans to keep guard, for"
100,9,347,their wives and children are not here.”
100,9,348,"Ulysses then said, “Now tell me; are they sleeping among the"
100,9,349,"Trojan troops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may"
100,9,350,understand it.”
100,9,351,"“I will tell you truly all,” replied Dolon. “To the seaward lie"
100,9,352,"the Carians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians,"
100,9,353,"and the noble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the"
100,9,354,"Phrygians and Meonians, have their place on the side towards"
100,9,355,Thymbra; but why ask about all this? If you want to find your way
100,9,356,"into the host of the Trojans, there are the Thracians, who have"
100,9,357,lately come here and lie apart from the others at the far end of
100,9,358,the camp; and they have Rhesus son of Eioneus for their king. His
100,9,359,"horses are the finest and strongest that I have ever seen, they"
100,9,360,are whiter than snow and fleeter than any wind that blows. His
100,9,361,"chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and he has brought his"
100,9,362,"marvellous golden armour, of the rarest workmanship — too splendid"
100,9,363,"for any mortal man to carry, and meet only for the gods. Now,"
100,9,364,"therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely here, until"
100,9,365,you come back and have proved my words whether they be false or
100,9,366,true.”
100,9,367,"Diomed looked sternly at him and answered, “Think not, Dolon, for"
100,9,368,"all the good information you have given us, that you shall escape"
100,9,369,"now you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you"
100,9,370,will come some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as
100,9,371,"a spy or as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you,"
100,9,372,you will give no more trouble.”
100,9,373,On this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him
100,9,374,"further, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his"
100,9,375,sword and cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling
100,9,376,in the dust while he was yet speaking. They took the ferret - skin
100,9,377,"cap from his head, and also the wolf - skin, the bow, and his long"
100,9,378,spear. Ulysses hung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the
100,9,379,"goddess of plunder, and prayed saying, “Accept these, goddess,"
100,9,380,for we give them to you in preference to all the gods in Olympus:
100,9,381,therefore speed us still further towards the horses and
100,9,382,sleeping - ground of the Thracians.”
100,9,383,With these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk
100,9,384,"tree, and they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering"
100,9,385,boughs of tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back
100,9,386,through the flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards
100,9,387,"amid the fallen armour and the blood, and came presently to the"
100,9,388,"company of Thracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with"
100,9,389,their day’s toil; their goodly armour was lying on the ground
100,9,390,"beside them all orderly in three rows, and each man had his yoke"
100,9,391,"of horses beside him. Rhesus was sleeping in the middle, and hard"
100,9,392,by him his horses were made fast to the topmost rim of his
100,9,393,"chariot. Ulysses from some way off saw him and said, “This,"
100,9,394,"Diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about which Dolon"
100,9,395,whom we killed told us. Do your very utmost; dally not about your
100,9,396,"armour, but loose the horses at once — or else kill the men"
100,9,397,"yourself, while I see to the horses.”"
100,9,398,"Thereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he"
100,9,399,smote them right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they
100,9,400,"were being hacked about, and the earth was red with their blood."
100,9,401,As a lion springs furiously upon a flock of sheep or goats when
100,9,402,"he finds them without their shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus"
100,9,403,set upon the Thracian soldiers till he had killed twelve. As he
100,9,404,killed them Ulysses came and drew them aside by their feet one by
100,9,405,"one, that the horses might go forward freely without being"
100,9,406,"frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they were not"
100,9,407,"yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to the king, he"
100,9,408,"killed him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing hard,"
100,9,409,"for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the seed of Oeneus,"
100,9,410,hovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses untied the
100,9,411,"horses, made them fast one to another and drove them off,"
100,9,412,"striking them with his bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip"
100,9,413,from the chariot. Then he whistled as a sign to Diomed.
100,9,414,"But Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed"
100,9,415,he might accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot
100,9,416,"in which the king’s armour was lying, and draw it out by the"
100,9,417,"pole, or to lift the armour out and carry it off; or whether"
100,9,418,"again, he should not kill some more Thracians. While he was thus"
100,9,419,"hesitating Minerva came up to him and said, “Get back, Diomed, to"
100,9,420,"the ships or you may be driven thither, should some other god"
100,9,421,rouse the Trojans.”
100,9,422,"Diomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the"
100,9,423,horses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to
100,9,424,the ships of the Achaeans.
100,9,425,But Apollo kept no blind look - out when he saw Minerva with the
100,9,426,"son of Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of"
100,9,427,"the Trojans he roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians"
100,9,428,and a noble kinsman of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and
100,9,429,"saw that the horses were no longer in their place, and that the"
100,9,430,"men were gasping in their death - agony; on this he groaned aloud,"
100,9,431,and called upon his friend by name. Then the whole Trojan camp
100,9,432,"was in an uproar as the people kept hurrying together, and they"
100,9,433,marvelled at the deeds of the heroes who had now got away towards
100,9,434,the ships.
100,9,435,"When they reached the place where they had killed Hector’s scout,"
100,9,436,"Ulysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the"
100,9,437,"ground, placed the blood - stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses"
100,9,438,"and remounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew"
100,9,439,forward nothing loth towards the ships as though of their own
100,9,440,free will. Nestor was first to hear the tramp of their feet. “My
100,9,441,"friends,” said he, “princes and counsellors of the Argives, shall"
100,9,442,I guess right or wrong? — but I must say what I think: there is a
100,9,443,sound in my ears as of the tramp of horses. I hope it may be
100,9,444,"Diomed and Ulysses driving in horses from the Trojans, but I much"
100,9,445,fear that the bravest of the Argives may have come to some harm
100,9,446,at their hands.”
100,9,447,He had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and
100,9,448,"dismounted, whereon the others shook hands right gladly with them"
100,9,449,and congratulated them. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to
100,9,450,"question them. “Tell me,” said he, “renowned Ulysses, how did you"
100,9,451,two come by these horses? Did you steal in among the Trojan
100,9,452,"forces, or did some god meet you and give them to you? They are"
100,9,453,"like sunbeams. I am well conversant with the Trojans, for old"
100,9,454,"warrior though I am I never hold back by the ships, but I never"
100,9,455,yet saw or heard of such horses as these are. Surely some god
100,9,456,"must have met you and given them to you, for you are both of you"
100,9,457,"dear to Jove, and to Jove’s daughter Minerva.”"
100,9,458,"And Ulysses answered, “Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the"
100,9,459,"Achaean name, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better"
100,9,460,"horses than these, for the gods are far mightier than we are."
100,9,461,"These horses, however, about which you ask me, are freshly come"
100,9,462,from Thrace. Diomed killed their king with the twelve bravest of
100,9,463,his companions. Hard by the ships we took a thirteenth man — a
100,9,464,scout whom Hector and the other Trojans had sent as a spy upon
100,9,465,our ships.”
100,9,466,"He laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while"
100,9,467,the other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the
100,9,468,"strongly built quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the"
100,9,469,"horses with thongs of leather to the manger, where the steeds of"
100,9,470,"Diomed stood eating their sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the"
100,9,471,"blood - stained spoils of Dolon at the stern of his ship, that they"
100,9,472,"might prepare a sacred offering to Minerva. As for themselves,"
100,9,473,"they went into the sea and washed the sweat from their bodies,"
100,9,474,and from their necks and thighs. When the sea - water had taken all
100,9,475,"the sweat from off them, and had refreshed them, they went into"
100,9,476,the baths and washed themselves. After they had so done and had
100,9,477,"anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table, and drawing"
100,9,478,"from a full mixing - bowl, made a drink - offering of wine to"
100,9,479,Minerva.
100,10,1,"In the forenoon the fight is equal, but Agamemnon turns the"
100,10,2,fortune of the day towards the Achaeans until he gets wounded and
100,10,3,leaves the field — Hector then drives everything before him till he
100,10,4,"is wounded by Diomed — Paris wounds Diomed — Ulysses, Nestor, and"
100,10,5,Idomeneus perform prodigies of valour — Machaon is wounded — Nestor
100,10,6,drives him off in his chariot — Achilles sees the pair driving
100,10,7,towards the camp and sends Patroclus to ask who it is that is
100,10,8,wounded — This is the beginning of evil for Patroclus — Nestor makes
100,10,9,a long speech.
100,10,10,"And now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of"
100,10,11,"light alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord"
100,10,12,with the ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans.
100,10,13,She took her stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses’ ship which
100,10,14,"was middlemost of all, so that her voice might carry farthest on"
100,10,15,"either side, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of"
100,10,16,"Telamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles — for these two"
100,10,17,"heroes, well - assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn"
100,10,18,up their ships at the two ends of the line. There she took her
100,10,19,"stand, and raised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the"
100,10,20,"Achaeans with courage, giving them heart to fight resolutely and"
100,10,21,"with all their might, so that they had rather stay there and do"
100,10,22,battle than go home in their ships.
100,10,23,The son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird
100,10,24,themselves for battle while he put on his armour. First he girded
100,10,25,"his goodly greaves about his legs, making them fast with"
100,10,26,ankle - clasps of silver; and about his chest he set the
100,10,27,breastplate which Cinyras had once given him as a guest - gift. It
100,10,28,had been noised abroad as far as Cyprus that the Achaeans were
100,10,29,"about to sail for Troy, and therefore he gave it to the king. It"
100,10,30,"had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of gold, and ten of tin."
100,10,31,There were serpents of cyanus that reared themselves up towards
100,10,32,"the neck, three upon either side, like the rainbows which the son"
100,10,33,of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal men. About his
100,10,34,"shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and"
100,10,35,the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang
100,10,36,it. He took moreover the richly - dight shield that covered his
100,10,37,"body when he was in battle — fair to see, with ten circles of"
100,10,38,bronze running all round it. On the body of the shield there were
100,10,39,"twenty bosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the"
100,10,40,"middle: this last was made to show a Gorgon’s head, fierce and"
100,10,41,"grim, with Rout and Panic on either side. The band for the arm to"
100,10,42,"go through was of silver, on which there was a writhing snake of"
100,10,43,"cyanus with three heads that sprang from a single neck, and went"
100,10,44,"in and out among one another. On his head Agamemnon set a helmet,"
100,10,45,"with a peak before and behind, and four plumes of horse - hair that"
100,10,46,nodded menacingly above it; then he grasped two redoubtable
100,10,47,"bronze - shod spears, and the gleam of his armour shot from him as"
100,10,48,"a flame into the firmament, while Juno and Minerva thundered in"
100,10,49,honour of the king of rich Mycene.
100,10,50,Every man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold
100,10,51,"them in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on"
100,10,52,"foot clad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into"
100,10,53,the dawning. The chiefs were armed and at the trench before the
100,10,54,"horses got there, but these came up presently. The son of Saturn"
100,10,55,"sent a portent of evil sound about their host, and the dew fell"
100,10,56,"red with blood, for he was about to send many a brave man"
100,10,57,hurrying down to Hades.
100,10,58,"The Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the"
100,10,59,"plain, were gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas"
100,10,60,"who was honoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three"
100,10,61,"sons of Antenor, Polybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a"
100,10,62,"god. Hector’s round shield showed in the front rank, and as some"
100,10,63,baneful star that shines for a moment through a rent in the
100,10,64,clouds and is again hidden beneath them; even so was Hector now
100,10,65,"seen in the front ranks and now again in the hindermost, and his"
100,10,66,bronze armour gleamed like the lightning of aegis - bearing Jove.
100,10,67,And now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon
100,10,68,"a rich man’s land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even"
100,10,69,so did the Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were
100,10,70,"in no mood for yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side"
100,10,71,"got the better of the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them,"
100,10,72,for she was the only god that went among them; the others were
100,10,73,"not there, but stayed quietly each in his own home among the"
100,10,74,dells and valleys of Olympus. All of them blamed the son of
100,10,75,"Saturn for wanting to give victory to the Trojans, but father"
100,10,76,"Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all, and sat apart in"
100,10,77,"his all - glorious majesty, looking down upon the city of the"
100,10,78,"Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and"
100,10,79,alike upon the slayers and on the slain.
100,10,80,"Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their"
100,10,81,"darts rained thick on one another and the people perished, but as"
100,10,82,the hour drew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest
100,10,83,will get his midday meal — for he has felled till his hands are
100,10,84,"weary; he is tired out, and must now have food — then the Danaans"
100,10,85,"with a cry that rang through all their ranks, broke the"
100,10,86,"battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon led them on, and slew first"
100,10,87,"Bienor, a leader of his people, and afterwards his comrade and"
100,10,88,"charioteer Oileus, who sprang from his chariot and was coming"
100,10,89,full towards him; but Agamemnon struck him on the forehead with
100,10,90,"his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail against the weapon,"
100,10,91,"which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were"
100,10,92,battered in and he was killed in full fight.
100,10,93,Agamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with
100,10,94,their breasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went
100,10,95,"on to kill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a"
100,10,96,"bastard, the other born in wedlock; they were in the same"
100,10,97,"chariot — the bastard driving, while noble Antiphus fought beside"
100,10,98,him. Achilles had once taken both of them prisoners in the glades
100,10,99,"of Ida, and had bound them with fresh withes as they were"
100,10,100,"shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now, however,"
100,10,101,Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in the chest above the nipple
100,10,102,"with his spear, while he struck Antiphus hard by the ear and"
100,10,103,threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he stripped their goodly
100,10,104,"armour from off them and recognized them, for he had already seen"
100,10,105,them at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida. As a lion
100,10,106,fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great
100,10,107,"jaws, robbing them of their tender life while he on his way back"
100,10,108,to his lair — the hind can do nothing for them even though she be
100,10,109,"close by, for she is in an agony of fear, and flies through the"
100,10,110,"thick forest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before the mighty"
100,10,111,"monster — so, no man of the Trojans could help Isus and Antiphus,"
100,10,112,for they were themselves flying in panic before the Argives.
100,10,113,"Then King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and"
100,10,114,brave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in
100,10,115,"preventing Helen’s being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely"
100,10,116,"bribed by Alexandrus; and now Agamemnon took his two sons, both"
100,10,117,"in the same chariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand — for"
100,10,118,they had lost hold of the reins and the horses were mad with
100,10,119,"fear. The son of Atreus sprang upon them like a lion, and the"
100,10,120,"pair besought him from their chariot. “Take us alive,” they"
100,10,121,"cried, “son of Atreus, and you shall receive a great ransom for"
100,10,122,"us. Our father Antimachus has great store of gold, bronze, and"
100,10,123,"wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy you with a very large"
100,10,124,ransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships of the
100,10,125,Achaeans.”
100,10,126,"With such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but"
100,10,127,"they heard no pitiful answer in return. “If,” said Agamemnon,"
100,10,128,"“you are sons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans"
100,10,129,"proposed that Menelaus and Ulysses, who had come to you as"
100,10,130,"envoys, should be killed and not suffered to return, you shall"
100,10,131,now pay for the foul iniquity of your father.”
100,10,132,"As he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth,"
100,10,133,"smiting him on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face"
100,10,134,"uppermost upon the ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did"
100,10,135,Agamemnon smite; he cut off his hands and his head — which he sent
100,10,136,rolling in among the crowd as though it were a ball. There he let
100,10,137,"them both lie, and wherever the ranks were thickest thither he"
100,10,138,"flew, while the other Achaeans followed. Foot soldiers drove the"
100,10,139,"foot soldiers of the foe in rout before them, and slew them;"
100,10,140,"horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thundering tramp of"
100,10,141,the horses raised a cloud of dust from off the plain. King
100,10,142,"Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and cheering on the"
100,10,143,Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze — the eddying
100,10,144,gusts whirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and
100,10,145,are consumed before the blast of the flame — even so fell the heads
100,10,146,"of the flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and many a"
100,10,147,noble pair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways of
100,10,148,"war, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful"
100,10,149,now to vultures than to their wives.
100,10,150,"Jove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage"
100,10,151,"and din of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling"
100,10,152,"out lustily to the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus,"
100,10,153,"son of Dardanus, in the middle of the plain, and past the place"
100,10,154,of the wild fig - tree making always for the city — the son of Atreus
100,10,155,"still shouting, and with hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when"
100,10,156,"they had reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, there they"
100,10,157,halted and waited for the others to come up. Meanwhile the
100,10,158,Trojans kept on flying over the middle of the plain like a herd
100,10,159,of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them in the
100,10,160,"dead of night — he springs on one of them, seizes her neck in the"
100,10,161,grip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges
100,10,162,himself upon her entrails — even so did King Agamemnon son of
100,10,163,"Atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they"
100,10,164,fled pell - mell before him. Many a man was flung headlong from his
100,10,165,"chariot by the hand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded his"
100,10,166,spear with fury.
100,10,167,"But when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city,"
100,10,168,the father of gods and men came down from heaven and took his
100,10,169,"seat, thunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many - fountained Ida."
100,10,170,He then told Iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him.
100,10,171,"“Go,” said he, “fleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector — say that so"
100,10,172,long as he sees Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the
100,10,173,"Trojan ranks, he is to keep aloof and bid the others bear the"
100,10,174,"brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either by"
100,10,175,"spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will I vouchsafe"
100,10,176,him strength to slay till he reach the ships and night falls at
100,10,177,the going down of the sun.”
100,10,178,Iris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the
100,10,179,"crests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his"
100,10,180,"chariot and horses. Then she said, “Hector son of Priam, peer of"
100,10,181,"gods in counsel, father Jove has sent me to bear you this"
100,10,182,message — so long as you see Agamemnon heading his men and making
100,10,183,"havoc of the Trojan ranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the"
100,10,184,"others bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is"
100,10,185,"wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then"
100,10,186,will Jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till you reach the
100,10,187,"ships, and till night falls at the going down of the sun.”"
100,10,188,"When she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full"
100,10,189,"armed from his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he"
100,10,190,"went about everywhere among the host, cheering his men on to"
100,10,191,"fight, and stirring the dread strife of battle. The Trojans then"
100,10,192,"wheeled round, and again met the Achaeans, while the Argives on"
100,10,193,their part strengthened their battalions. The battle was now in
100,10,194,"array and they stood face to face with one another, Agamemnon"
100,10,195,ever pressing forward in his eagerness to be ahead of all others.
100,10,196,"Tell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who,"
100,10,197,"whether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face"
100,10,198,"Agamemnon? It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and"
100,10,199,"of great stature, who was brought up in fertile Thrace, the"
100,10,200,"mother of sheep. Cisses, his mother’s father, brought him up in"
100,10,201,"his own house when he was a child — Cisses, father to fair Theano."
100,10,202,"When he reached manhood, Cisses would have kept him there, and"
100,10,203,"was for giving him his daughter in marriage, but as soon as he"
100,10,204,had married he set out to fight the Achaeans with twelve ships
100,10,205,that followed him: these he had left at Percote and had come on
100,10,206,by land to Ilius. He it was that now met Agamemnon son of Atreus.
100,10,207,"When they were close up with one another, the son of Atreus"
100,10,208,"missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on the girdle below the"
100,10,209,"cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strength"
100,10,210,"of arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for"
100,10,211,the point of the spear struck against the silver and was turned
100,10,212,aside as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from
100,10,213,"his hand, and drew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he"
100,10,214,"then drew his sword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the"
100,10,215,"neck. So there the poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were"
100,10,216,"of bronze, killed in the defence of his fellow - citizens, far from"
100,10,217,"his wedded wife, of whom he had had no joy though he had given"
100,10,218,"much for her: he had given a hundred - head of cattle down, and had"
100,10,219,"promised later on to give a thousand sheep and goats mixed, from"
100,10,220,the countless flocks of which he was possessed. Agamemnon son of
100,10,221,"Atreus then despoiled him, and carried off his armour into the"
100,10,222,host of the Achaeans.
100,10,223,"When noble Coon, Antenor’s eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were"
100,10,224,his eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon
100,10,225,"he got beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle"
100,10,226,"of his arm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right"
100,10,227,"through the arm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not"
100,10,228,"even for this did he leave off struggling and fighting, but"
100,10,229,"grasped his spear that flew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon"
100,10,230,Coon who was trying to drag off the body of his brother — his
100,10,231,"father’s son — by the foot, and was crying for help to all the"
100,10,232,bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon struck him with a
100,10,233,bronze - shod spear and killed him as he was dragging the dead body
100,10,234,through the press of men under cover of his shield: he then cut
100,10,235,"off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas. Thus did the"
100,10,236,sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son of
100,10,237,"Atreus, and go down into the house of Hades."
100,10,238,As long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon
100,10,239,went about attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword
100,10,240,"and with great handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased"
100,10,241,"to flow and the wound grew dry, the pain became great. As the"
100,10,242,"sharp pangs which the Eilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth,"
100,10,243,"daughters of Juno and dispensers of cruel pain, send upon a woman"
100,10,244,when she is in labour — even so sharp were the pangs of the son of
100,10,245,"Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot, and bade his charioteer"
100,10,246,"drive to the ships, for he was in great agony. With a loud clear"
100,10,247,"voice he shouted to the Danaans, “My friends, princes and"
100,10,248,"counsellors of the Argives, defend the ships yourselves, for Jove"
100,10,249,has not suffered me to fight the whole day through against the
100,10,250,Trojans.”
100,10,251,"With this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and"
100,10,252,they flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam
100,10,253,"and their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of"
100,10,254,the battle.
100,10,255,"When Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the"
100,10,256,"Trojans and Lycians saying, “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian"
100,10,257,"warriors, be men, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle"
100,10,258,"bravely; their best man has left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me"
100,10,259,a great triumph; charge the foe with your chariots that you may
100,10,260,win still greater glory.”
100,10,261,"With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a"
100,10,262,"huntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so"
100,10,263,"did Hector, peer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the"
100,10,264,"Achaeans. Full of hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell"
100,10,265,on the fight like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the
100,10,266,"sea, and lashes its deep blue waters into fury."
100,10,267,"What, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam"
100,10,268,killed in the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him?
100,10,269,"First Asaeus, Autonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius,"
100,10,270,"Opheltius and Agelaus; Aesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in"
100,10,271,"battle; these chieftains of the Achaeans did Hector slay, and"
100,10,272,then he fell upon the rank and file. As when the west wind
100,10,273,hustles the clouds of the white south and beats them down with
100,10,274,"the fierceness of its fury — the waves of the sea roll high, and"
100,10,275,the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the wandering wind — even
100,10,276,so thick were the heads of them that fell by the hand of Hector.
100,10,277,"All had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would"
100,10,278,"have fled pell - mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to"
100,10,279,"Diomed, “Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus"
100,10,280,"forget our prowess? Come, my good fellow, stand by my side and"
100,10,281,"help me, we shall be shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships.”"
100,10,282,"And Diomed answered, “Come what may, I will stand firm; but we"
100,10,283,"shall have scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to"
100,10,284,the Trojans rather than to us.”
100,10,285,With these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the
100,10,286,"ground, smiting him in the left breast with his spear, while"
100,10,287,"Ulysses killed Molion who was his squire. These they let lie, now"
100,10,288,that they had stopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on
100,10,289,"playing havoc with the foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury"
100,10,290,and rend the hounds that hunt them. Thus did they turn upon the
100,10,291,"Trojans and slay them, and the Achaeans were thankful to have"
100,10,292,breathing time in their flight from Hector.
100,10,293,"They then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of"
100,10,294,"Merops of Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of"
100,10,295,"divination. He had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they"
100,10,296,"would not obey him, for fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son"
100,10,297,"of Tydeus slew them both and stripped them of their armour, while"
100,10,298,Ulysses killed Hippodamus and Hypeirochus.
100,10,299,And now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained
100,10,300,"that neither side should have the advantage, and they kept on"
100,10,301,killing one another. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of
100,10,302,Paeon in the hip - joint with his spear. His chariot was not at
100,10,303,"hand for him to fly with, so blindly confident had he been. His"
100,10,304,squire was in charge of it at some distance and he was fighting
100,10,305,on foot among the foremost until he lost his life. Hector soon
100,10,306,"marked the havoc Diomed and Ulysses were making, and bore down"
100,10,307,"upon them with a loud cry, followed by the Trojan ranks; brave"
100,10,308,"Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and said to Ulysses who was"
100,10,309,"beside him, “Great Hector is bearing down upon us and we shall be"
100,10,310,undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.”
100,10,311,"He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss"
100,10,312,his mark. He had aimed at Hector’s head near the top of his
100,10,313,"helmet, but bronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was"
100,10,314,"untouched, for the spear was stayed by the visored helm made with"
100,10,315,"three plates of metal, which Phoebus Apollo had given him. Hector"
100,10,316,sprang back with a great bound under cover of the ranks; he fell
100,10,317,on his knees and propped himself with his brawny hand leaning on
100,10,318,"the ground, for darkness had fallen on his eyes. The son of"
100,10,319,Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among the foremost
100,10,320,"fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the ground;"
100,10,321,meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing back into his
100,10,322,"chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life."
100,10,323,"But Diomed made at him with his spear and said, “Dog, you have"
100,10,324,again got away though death was close on your heels. Phoebus
100,10,325,"Apollo, to whom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, has again"
100,10,326,"saved you, nevertheless I will meet you and make an end of you"
100,10,327,"hereafter, if there is any god who will stand by me too and be my"
100,10,328,helper. For the present I must pursue those I can lay hands on.”
100,10,329,"As he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon,"
100,10,330,"but Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him,"
100,10,331,leaning against a pillar of the monument which men had raised to
100,10,332,"Ilus son of Dardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken"
100,10,333,"the cuirass from off the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet"
100,10,334,"also, and the shield from off his shoulders, when Paris drew his"
100,10,335,"bow and let fly an arrow that sped not from his hand in vain, but"
100,10,336,"pierced the flat of Diomed’s right foot, going right through it"
100,10,337,and fixing itself in the ground. Thereon Paris with a hearty
100,10,338,"laugh sprang forward from his hiding - place, and taunted him"
100,10,339,"saying, “You are wounded — my arrow has not been shot in vain;"
100,10,340,"would that it had hit you in the belly and killed you, for thus"
100,10,341,"the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion, would have had a"
100,10,342,truce from evil.”
100,10,343,"Diomed all undaunted answered, “Archer, you who without your bow"
100,10,344,"are nothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in"
100,10,345,"single combat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows"
100,10,346,would serve you in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you
100,10,347,have scratched the sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl
100,10,348,or some silly boy had hit me. A worthless coward can inflict but
100,10,349,a light wound; when I wound a man though I but graze his skin it
100,10,350,"is another matter, for my weapon will lay him low. His wife will"
100,10,351,tear her cheeks for grief and his children will be fatherless:
100,10,352,"there will he rot, reddening the earth with his blood, and"
100,10,353,"vultures, not women, will gather round him.”"
100,10,354,"Thus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this"
100,10,355,"cover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was"
100,10,356,the pain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his
100,10,357,"chariot and bade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he"
100,10,358,was sick at heart.
100,10,359,"Ulysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for"
100,10,360,"they were all panic - stricken. “Alas,” said he to himself in his"
100,10,361,"dismay, “what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly"
100,10,362,"before these odds, but it will be worse if I am left alone and"
100,10,363,"taken prisoner, for the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the"
100,10,364,Danaans with panic. But why talk to myself in this way? Well do I
100,10,365,"know that though cowards quit the field, a hero, whether he wound"
100,10,366,"or be wounded, must stand firm and hold his own.”"
100,10,367,"While he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced"
100,10,368,"and hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to rue it. As"
100,10,369,hounds and lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from
100,10,370,his lair whetting his white tusks — they attack him from every side
100,10,371,"and can hear the gnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness"
100,10,372,they still hold their ground — even so furiously did the Trojans
100,10,373,attack Ulysses. First he sprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and
100,10,374,wounded him on the shoulder with a downward blow; then he killed
100,10,375,Thoon and Ennomus. After these he struck Chersidamas in the loins
100,10,376,under his shield as he had just sprung down from his chariot; so
100,10,377,he fell in the dust and clutched the earth in the hollow of his
100,10,378,"hand. These he let lie, and went on to wound Charops son of"
100,10,379,"Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus, hero that he was,"
100,10,380,"made all speed to help him, and when he was close to Ulysses he"
100,10,381,"said, “Far - famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil, this day"
100,10,382,you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of Hippasus
100,10,383,"and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before my"
100,10,384,spear.”
100,10,385,With these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went
100,10,386,through the shield and passed on through his richly wrought
100,10,387,"cuirass, tearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did"
100,10,388,not suffer it to pierce the entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew
100,10,389,"that his hour was not yet come, but he gave ground and said to"
100,10,390,"Socus, “Wretch, you shall now surely die. You have stayed me from"
100,10,391,"fighting further with the Trojans, but you shall now fall by my"
100,10,392,"spear, yielding glory to myself, and your soul to Hades of the"
100,10,393,noble steeds.”
100,10,394,"Socus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck"
100,10,395,"him in the back midway between the shoulders, and went right"
100,10,396,through his chest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses
100,10,397,"vaunted over him saying, “O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of"
100,10,398,"horses, death has been too quick for you and you have not escaped"
100,10,399,"him: poor wretch, not even in death shall your father and mother"
100,10,400,"close your eyes, but the ravening vultures shall enshroud you"
100,10,401,with the flapping of their dark wings and devour you. Whereas
100,10,402,even though I fall the Achaeans will give me my due rites of
100,10,403,burial.”
100,10,404,So saying he drew Socus’s heavy spear out of his flesh and from
100,10,405,"his shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was"
100,10,406,withdrawn so that he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that
100,10,407,Ulysses was bleeding they raised a great shout and came on in a
100,10,408,"body towards him; he therefore gave ground, and called his"
100,10,409,comrades to come and help him. Thrice did he cry as loudly as man
100,10,410,"can cry, and thrice did brave Menelaus hear him; he turned,"
100,10,411,"therefore, to Ajax who was close beside him and said, “Ajax,"
100,10,412,"noble son of Telamon, captain of your people, the cry of Ulysses"
100,10,413,"rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off and were"
100,10,414,worsting him while he is single - handed. Let us make our way
100,10,415,through the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I fear he
100,10,416,may come to harm for all his valour if he be left without
100,10,417,"support, and the Danaans would miss him sorely.”"
100,10,418,He led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had
100,10,419,gathered round Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the
100,10,420,carcase of some horned stag that has been hit with an arrow — the
100,10,421,stag has fled at full speed so long as his blood was warm and his
100,10,422,"strength has lasted, but when the arrow has overcome him, the"
100,10,423,savage jackals devour him in the shady glades of the forest. Then
100,10,424,"heaven sends a fierce lion thither, whereon the jackals fly in"
100,10,425,terror and the lion robs them of their prey — even so did Trojans
100,10,426,"many and brave gather round crafty Ulysses, but the hero stood at"
100,10,427,bay and kept them off with his spear. Ajax then came up with his
100,10,428,"shield before him like a wall, and stood hard by, whereon the"
100,10,429,Trojans fled in all directions. Menelaus took Ulysses by the
100,10,430,"hand, and led him out of the press while his squire brought up"
100,10,431,"his chariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans and killed"
100,10,432,"Doryclus, a bastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandocus,"
100,10,433,"Lysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes"
100,10,434,"rushing in full flood from the mountains on to the plain, big"
100,10,435,with the rain of heaven — many a dry oak and many a pine does it
100,10,436,"engulf, and much mud does it bring down and cast into the"
100,10,437,sea — even so did brave Ajax chase the foe furiously over the
100,10,438,"plain, slaying both men and horses."
100,10,439,"Hector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting"
100,10,440,on the extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river
100,10,441,"Scamander, where the carnage was thickest and the war - cry loudest"
100,10,442,round Nestor and brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making
100,10,443,"great slaughter with his spear and furious driving, and was"
100,10,444,destroying the ranks that were opposed to him; still the Achaeans
100,10,445,"would have given no ground, had not Alexandrus husband of lovely"
100,10,446,"Helen stayed the prowess of Machaon, shepherd of his people, by"
100,10,447,wounding him in the right shoulder with a triple - barbed arrow.
100,10,448,The Achaeans were in great fear that as the fight had turned
100,10,449,"against them the Trojans might take him prisoner, and Idomeneus"
100,10,450,"said to Nestor, “Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean"
100,10,451,"name, mount your chariot at once; take Machaon with you and drive"
100,10,452,your horses to the ships as fast as you can. A physician is worth
100,10,453,"more than several other men put together, for he can cut out"
100,10,454,arrows and spread healing herbs.”
100,10,455,Nestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at
100,10,456,"once mounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician"
100,10,457,"Aesculapius, went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew"
100,10,458,"onward nothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own"
100,10,459,free will.
100,10,460,Then Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector
100,10,461,"from his place beside him, “Hector, here are we two fighting on"
100,10,462,"the extreme wing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in"
100,10,463,"pell - mell rout, they and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is"
100,10,464,driving them before him; I know him by the breadth of his shield:
100,10,465,"let us turn our chariot and horses thither, where horse and foot"
100,10,466,"are fighting most desperately, and where the cry of battle is"
100,10,467,loudest.”
100,10,468,"With this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the"
100,10,469,whip they drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and
100,10,470,"Trojans, over the bodies and shields of those that had fallen:"
100,10,471,"the axle was bespattered with blood, and the rail round the car"
100,10,472,was covered with splashes both from the horses’ hoofs and from
100,10,473,the tyres of the wheels. Hector tore his way through and flung
100,10,474,"himself into the thick of the fight, and his presence threw the"
100,10,475,"Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not long idle;"
100,10,476,"nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword and spear,"
100,10,477,"and throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax son of Telamon, for"
100,10,478,Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought a better man
100,10,479,than himself.
100,10,480,Then father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart
100,10,481,"of Ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind"
100,10,482,him — looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were
100,10,483,"some wild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching"
100,10,484,slowly backwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from
100,10,485,"their stockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off"
100,10,486,"the pick of their herd — he makes his greedy spring, but in vain,"
100,10,487,"for the darts from many a strong hand fall thick around him, with"
100,10,488,"burning brands that scare him for all his fury, and when morning"
100,10,489,"comes he slinks foiled and angry away — even so did Ajax, sorely"
100,10,490,"against his will, retreat angrily before the Trojans, fearing for"
100,10,491,the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some lazy ass that has had many
100,10,492,"a cudgel broken about his back, when he into a field begins"
100,10,493,"eating the corn — boys beat him but he is too many for them, and"
100,10,494,though they lay about with their sticks they cannot hurt him;
100,10,495,still when he has had his fill they at last drive him from the
100,10,496,"field — even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue great Ajax,"
100,10,497,ever smiting the middle of his shield with their darts. Now and
100,10,498,"again he would turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions"
100,10,499,"of the Trojans, and then he would again retreat; but he prevented"
100,10,500,any of them from making his way to the ships. Single - handed he
100,10,501,stood midway between the Trojans and Achaeans: the spears that
100,10,502,"sped from their hands stuck some of them in his mighty shield,"
100,10,503,"while many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the ground"
100,10,504,ere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair flesh.
100,10,505,Now when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was
100,10,506,"being overpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and"
100,10,507,hurled his spear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver
100,10,508,"below the midriff, and laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him,"
100,10,509,and stripped the armour from his shoulders; but when Alexandrus
100,10,510,"saw him, he aimed an arrow at him which struck him in the right"
100,10,511,"thigh; the arrow broke, but the point that was left in the wound"
100,10,512,"dragged on the thigh; he drew back, therefore, under cover of his"
100,10,513,"comrades to save his life, shouting as he did so to the Danaans,"
100,10,514,"“My friends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, rally to the"
100,10,515,"defence of Ajax who is being overpowered, and I doubt whether he"
100,10,516,"will come out of the fight alive. Hither, then, to the rescue of"
100,10,517,great Ajax son of Telamon.”
100,10,518,Even so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came
100,10,519,"near, and gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from"
100,10,520,their shoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards
100,10,521,"them, and turned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached"
100,10,522,his men.
100,10,523,Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the
100,10,524,"mares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor"
100,10,525,"out of the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people."
100,10,526,"Achilles saw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of"
100,10,527,his ship watching the hard stress and struggle of the fight. He
100,10,528,"called from the ship to his comrade Patroclus, who heard him in"
100,10,529,the tent and came out looking like Mars himself — here indeed was
100,10,530,"the beginning of the ill that presently befell him. “Why,” said"
100,10,531,"he, “Achilles, do you call me? What do you want with me?” And"
100,10,532,"Achilles answered, “Noble son of Menoetius, man after my own"
100,10,533,"heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans praying at my"
100,10,534,"knees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroclus, and ask"
100,10,535,Nestor who it is that he is bearing away wounded from the field;
100,10,536,"from his back I should say it was Machaon son of Aesculapius, but"
100,10,537,I could not see his face for the horses went by me at full
100,10,538,speed.”
100,10,539,"Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off"
100,10,540,running by the ships and tents of the Achaeans.
100,10,541,When Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of
100,10,542,"Neleus, they dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the"
100,10,543,horses from the chariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the
100,10,544,"seaside to dry the sweat from their shirts, and when they had so"
100,10,545,"done they came inside and took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom"
100,10,546,"Nestor had had awarded to him from Tenedos when Achilles took it,"
100,10,547,"mixed them a mess; she was daughter of wise Arsinous, and the"
100,10,548,Achaeans had given her to Nestor because he excelled all of them
100,10,549,in counsel. First she set for them a fair and well - made table
100,10,550,that had feet of cyanus; on it there was a vessel of bronze and
100,10,551,"an onion to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakes of"
100,10,552,barley - meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship which the
100,10,553,"old man had brought with him from home, studded with bosses of"
100,10,554,"gold; it had four handles, on each of which there were two golden"
100,10,555,"doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. Any one else"
100,10,556,would hardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was
100,10,557,"full, but Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the woman, as"
100,10,558,"fair as a goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; she"
100,10,559,"grated goat’s milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in"
100,10,560,"a handful of white barley - meal, and having thus prepared the mess"
100,10,561,she bade them drink it. When they had done so and had thus
100,10,562,"quenched their thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at"
100,10,563,this moment Patroclus appeared at the door.
100,10,564,"When the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his"
100,10,565,"hand, led him into the tent, and bade him take his place among"
100,10,566,"them; but Patroclus stood where he was and said, “Noble sir, I"
100,10,567,"may not stay, you cannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me"
100,10,568,"is not one to be trifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded"
100,10,569,man was whom you were bearing away from the field. I can now see
100,10,570,"for myself that he is Machaon, shepherd of his people. I must go"
100,10,571,"back and tell Achilles. You, sir, know what a terrible man he is,"
100,10,572,and how ready to blame even where no blame should lie.”
100,10,573,"And Nestor answered, “Why should Achilles care to know how many"
100,10,574,of the Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that
100,10,575,"reigns in our host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled,"
100,10,576,"brave Diomed, son of Tydeus, is wounded; so are Ulysses and"
100,10,577,"Agamemnon; Eurypylus has been hit with an arrow in the thigh, and"
100,10,578,I have just been bringing this man from the field — he too wounded
100,10,579,"with an arrow. Nevertheless, Achilles, so valiant though he be,"
100,10,580,"cares not and knows no ruth. Will he wait till the ships, do what"
100,10,581,"we may, are in a blaze, and we perish one upon the other? As for"
100,10,582,"me, I have no strength nor stay in me any longer; would that I"
100,10,583,were still young and strong as in the days when there was a fight
100,10,584,between us and the men of Elis about some cattle - raiding. I then
100,10,585,"killed Itymoneus, the valiant son of Hypeirochus, a dweller in"
100,10,586,"Elis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown"
100,10,587,by my hand while fighting in the front rank in defence of his
100,10,588,"cows, so he fell and the country people around him were in great"
100,10,589,"fear. We drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty"
100,10,590,herds of cattle and as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of
100,10,591,"pigs, and as many wide - spreading flocks of goats. Of horses,"
100,10,592,"moreover, we seized a hundred and fifty, all of them mares, and"
100,10,593,many had foals running with them. All these did we drive by night
100,10,594,"to Pylus, the city of Neleus, taking them within the city; and"
100,10,595,"the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had taken so much, though"
100,10,596,it was the first time I had ever been in the field. At daybreak
100,10,597,the heralds went round crying that all in Elis to whom there was
100,10,598,a debt owing should come; and the leading Pylians assembled to
100,10,599,divide the spoils. There were many to whom the Epeans owed
100,10,600,"chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and had been oppressed"
100,10,601,"with wrong; in former years Hercules had come, and had laid his"
100,10,602,"hand heavy upon us, so that all our best men had perished. Neleus"
100,10,603,"had had twelve sons, but I alone was left; the others had all"
100,10,604,been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all this had looked down
100,10,605,upon us and had done us much evil. My father chose a herd of
100,10,606,cattle and a great flock of sheep — three hundred in all — and he
100,10,607,"took their shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to"
100,10,608,"him in Elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and"
100,10,609,their chariots with them had gone to the games and were to run
100,10,610,"for a tripod, but King Augeas took them, and sent back their"
100,10,611,driver grieving for the loss of his horses. Neleus was angered by
100,10,612,"what he had both said and done, and took great value in return,"
100,10,613,"but he divided the rest, that no man might have less than his"
100,10,614,full share.
100,10,615,"“Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods"
100,10,616,throughout the city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in
100,10,617,"a body, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array,"
100,10,618,"and with them the two Moliones in their armour, though they were"
100,10,619,"still lads and unused to fighting. Now there is a certain town,"
100,10,620,"Thryoessa, perched upon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border"
100,10,621,"city of Pylus. This they would destroy, and pitched their camp"
100,10,622,"about it, but when they had crossed their whole plain, Minerva"
100,10,623,darted down by night from Olympus and bade us set ourselves in
100,10,624,"array; and she found willing soldiers in Pylos, for the men meant"
100,10,625,"fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, and hid my horses, for he"
100,10,626,said that as yet I could know nothing about war; nevertheless
100,10,627,"Minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I was, I fought"
100,10,628,among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them.
100,10,629,"There is a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene, and"
100,10,630,there they that were mounted (and I with them) waited till
100,10,631,"morning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in"
100,10,632,force. Thence in full panoply and equipment we came towards noon
100,10,633,"to the sacred waters of the Alpheus, and there we offered victims"
100,10,634,"to almighty Jove, with a bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and"
100,10,635,a herd - heifer to Minerva. After this we took supper in our
100,10,636,"companies, and laid us down to rest each in his armour by the"
100,10,637,river.
100,10,638,“The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to
100,10,639,"take it, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in"
100,10,640,store for them. When the sun’s rays began to fall upon the earth
100,10,641,"we joined battle, praying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the"
100,10,642,"fight had begun, I was the first to kill my man and take his"
100,10,643,"horses — to wit the warrior Mulius. He was son - in - law to Augeas,"
100,10,644,"having married his eldest daughter, golden - haired Agamede, who"
100,10,645,knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the face of the
100,10,646,"earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me, and when he"
100,10,647,"fell headlong in the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and took my"
100,10,648,place in the front ranks. The Epeans fled in all directions when
100,10,649,they saw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had)
100,10,650,"laid low, and I swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fifty"
100,10,651,"chariots — and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my"
100,10,652,"spear. I should have even killed the two Moliones, sons of Actor,"
100,10,653,"unless their real father, Neptune lord of the earthquake, had"
100,10,654,hidden them in a thick mist and borne them out of the fight.
100,10,655,"Thereon Jove vouchsafed the Pylians a great victory, for we"
100,10,656,"chased them far over the plain, killing the men and bringing in"
100,10,657,"their armour, till we had brought our horses to Buprasium, rich"
100,10,658,"in wheat, and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that is called"
100,10,659,"Alision, at which point Minerva turned the people back. There I"
100,10,660,slew the last man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their
100,10,661,horses back from Buprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among
100,10,662,"the gods, and among mortal men to Nestor."
100,10,663,"“Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles"
100,10,664,is for keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue
100,10,665,it hereafter when the host is being cut to pieces. My good
100,10,666,"friend, did not Menoetius charge you thus, on the day when he"
100,10,667,sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon? Ulysses and I were in the
100,10,668,"house, inside, and heard all that he said to you; for we came to"
100,10,669,the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits throughout all
100,10,670,"Achaea, and when we got there we found Menoetius and yourself,"
100,10,671,and Achilles with you. The old knight Peleus was in the outer
100,10,672,"court, roasting the fat thigh - bones of a heifer to Jove the lord"
100,10,673,of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which he
100,10,674,poured drink - offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. You
100,10,675,"two were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood"
100,10,676,"at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the"
100,10,677,"hand into the house, placed us at table, and set before us such"
100,10,678,hospitable entertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfied
100,10,679,"ourselves with meat and drink, I said my say and urged both of"
100,10,680,"you to join us. You were ready enough to do so, and the two old"
100,10,681,men charged you much and straitly. Old Peleus bade his son
100,10,682,"Achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie his peers,"
100,10,683,"while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus to you: ‘My son,’"
100,10,684,"said he, ‘Achilles is of nobler birth than you are, but you are"
100,10,685,"older than he, though he is far the better man of the two."
100,10,686,"Counsel him wisely, guide him in the right way, and he will"
100,10,687,"follow you to his own profit.’ Thus did your father charge you,"
100,10,688,"but you have forgotten; nevertheless, even now, say all this to"
100,10,689,Achilles if he will listen to you. Who knows but with heaven’s
100,10,690,"help you may talk him over, for it is good to take a friend’s"
100,10,691,"advice. If, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his"
100,10,692,"mother has told him something from Jove, then let him send you,"
100,10,693,"and let the rest of the Myrmidons follow with you, if perchance"
100,10,694,you may bring light and saving to the Danaans. And let him send
100,10,695,"you into battle clad in his own armour, that the Trojans may"
100,10,696,mistake you for him and leave off fighting; the sons of the
100,10,697,"Achaeans may thus have time to get their breath, for they are"
100,10,698,"hard pressed and there is little breathing time in battle. You,"
100,10,699,"who are fresh, might easily drive a tired enemy back to his walls"
100,10,700,and away from the tents and ships.”
100,10,701,"With these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off"
100,10,702,"running by the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of"
100,10,703,"Aeacus. When he had got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was"
100,10,704,"their place of assembly and court of justice, with their altars"
100,10,705,"dedicated to the gods, Eurypylus son of Euaemon, met him, wounded"
100,10,706,"in the thigh with an arrow, and limping out of the fight. Sweat"
100,10,707,"rained from his head and shoulders, and black blood welled from"
100,10,708,"his cruel wound, but his mind did not wander. The son of"
100,10,709,Menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon him and spoke
100,10,710,"piteously saying, “O unhappy princes and counsellors of the"
100,10,711,"Danaans, are you then doomed to feed the hounds of Troy with your"
100,10,712,"fat, far from your friends and your native land? Say, noble"
100,10,713,"Eurypylus, will the Achaeans be able to hold great Hector in"
100,10,714,"check, or will they fall now before his spear?”"
100,10,715,"Wounded Eurypylus made answer, “Noble Patroclus, there is no hope"
100,10,716,left for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All
100,10,717,they that were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded
100,10,718,"at the hands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and"
100,10,719,stronger. But save me and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow
100,10,720,"from my thigh; wash the black blood from off it with warm water,"
100,10,721,"and lay upon it those gracious herbs which, so they say, have"
100,10,722,"been shown you by Achilles, who was himself shown them by Chiron,"
100,10,723,most righteous of all the centaurs. For of the physicians
100,10,724,"Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that the one is lying wounded in"
100,10,725,"his tent and is himself in need of healing, while the other is"
100,10,726,fighting the Trojans upon the plain.”
100,10,727,"“Hero Eurypylus,” replied the brave son of Menoetius, “how may"
100,10,728,these things be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message
100,10,729,"to noble Achilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans,"
100,10,730,but even so I will not be unmindful of your distress.”
100,10,731,With this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the
100,10,732,"tent, and a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock - skins on the"
100,10,733,ground for him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out
100,10,734,the sharp arrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from
100,10,735,"the wound with warm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing"
100,10,736,"it between his hands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a"
100,10,737,virtuous herb which killed all pain; so the wound presently dried
100,10,738,and the blood left off flowing.
100,11,1,"The Trojans and their allies break the wall, led on by Hector."
100,11,2,So the son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus
100,11,3,"within the tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought"
100,11,4,"desperately, nor were the trench and the high wall above it, to"
100,11,5,keep the Trojans in check longer. They had built it to protect
100,11,6,"their ships, and had dug the trench all round it that it might"
100,11,7,safeguard both the ships and the rich spoils which they had
100,11,8,"taken, but they had not offered hecatombs to the gods. It had"
100,11,9,"been built without the consent of the immortals, and therefore it"
100,11,10,did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achilles nursed his
100,11,11,"anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken, the"
100,11,12,great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of
100,11,13,"the Trojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though"
100,11,14,"some were yet left alive — when, moreover, the city was sacked in"
100,11,15,"the tenth year, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to"
100,11,16,their own country — then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy
100,11,17,"the wall, and they turned on to it the streams of all the rivers"
100,11,18,"from Mount Ida into the sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus,"
100,11,19,"Rhodius, Grenicus, Aesopus, and goodly Scamander, with Simois,"
100,11,20,"where many a shield and helm had fallen, and many a hero of the"
100,11,21,race of demigods had bitten the dust. Phoebus Apollo turned the
100,11,22,mouths of all these rivers together and made them flow for nine
100,11,23,"days against the wall, while Jove rained the whole time that he"
100,11,24,"might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune himself, trident in"
100,11,25,"hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea all the"
100,11,26,foundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid with
100,11,27,so much toil; he made all level by the mighty stream of the
100,11,28,"Hellespont, and then when he had swept the wall away he spread a"
100,11,29,great beach of sand over the place where it had been. This done
100,11,30,he turned the rivers back into their old courses.
100,11,31,This was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but as
100,11,32,yet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its
100,11,33,"timbers rang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives,"
100,11,34,"cowed by the scourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in"
100,11,35,"fear of Hector the mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore"
100,11,36,fought with the force and fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild
100,11,37,"boar turns fiercely on the dogs and men that attack him, while"
100,11,38,these form a solid wall and shower their javelins as they face
100,11,39,"him — his courage is all undaunted, but his high spirit will be the"
100,11,40,death of him; many a time does he charge at his pursuers to
100,11,41,"scatter them, and they fall back as often as he does so — even so"
100,11,42,"did Hector go about among the host exhorting his men, and"
100,11,43,cheering them on to cross the trench.
100,11,44,"But the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its"
100,11,45,"brink, for the width frightened them. They could neither jump it"
100,11,46,"nor cross it, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either"
100,11,47,"side, above which there were the sharp stakes that the sons of"
100,11,48,the Achaeans had planted so close and strong as a defence against
100,11,49,"all who would assail it; a horse, therefore, could not get into"
100,11,50,"it and draw his chariot after him, but those who were on foot"
100,11,51,kept trying their very utmost. Then Polydamas went up to Hector
100,11,52,"and said, “Hector, and you other captains of the Trojans and"
100,11,53,"allies, it is madness for us to try and drive our horses across"
100,11,54,"the trench; it will be very hard to cross, for it is full of"
100,11,55,"sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall. Our horses"
100,11,56,"therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no use if they"
100,11,57,did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to harm.
100,11,58,"If, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in his"
100,11,59,"anger will utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly"
100,11,60,see them perish now and here far from Argos; but if they should
100,11,61,rally and we are driven back from the ships pell - mell into the
100,11,62,trench there will be not so much as a man get back to the city to
100,11,63,"tell the tale. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let our"
100,11,64,"squires hold our horses by the trench, but let us follow Hector"
100,11,65,"in a body on foot, clad in full armour, and if the day of their"
100,11,66,doom is at hand the Achaeans will not be able to withstand us.”
100,11,67,"Thus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang in"
100,11,68,"full armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they"
100,11,69,"saw him do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his"
100,11,70,horses over to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for
100,11,71,"him at the trench. Then they formed themselves into companies,"
100,11,72,"made themselves ready, and in five bodies followed their leaders."
100,11,73,Those that went with Hector and Polydamas were the bravest and
100,11,74,"most in number, and the most determined to break through the wall"
100,11,75,and fight at the ships. Cebriones was also joined with them as
100,11,76,"third in command, for Hector had left his chariot in charge of a"
100,11,77,"less valiant soldier. The next company was led by Paris,"
100,11,78,"Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus and Deiphobus, two"
100,11,79,"sons of Priam, and with them was the hero Asius — Asius, the son of"
100,11,80,"Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breed that comes from"
100,11,81,"the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas, the"
100,11,82,"valiant son of Anchises, led the fourth; he and the two sons of"
100,11,83,"Antenor, Archelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts"
100,11,84,"of war. Sarpedon was captain over the allies, and took with him"
100,11,85,Glaucus and Asteropaeus whom he deemed most valiant after
100,11,86,himself — for he was far the best man of them all. These helped to
100,11,87,"array one another in their ox - hide shields, and then charged"
100,11,88,"straight at the Danaans, for they felt sure that they would not"
100,11,89,hold out longer and that they should themselves now fall upon the
100,11,90,ships.
100,11,91,The rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel
100,11,92,"of Polydamas but Asius, son of Hyrtacus, would not leave his"
100,11,93,horses and his esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took
100,11,94,"them on with him towards the ships, nor did he fail to come by"
100,11,95,his end in consequence. Nevermore was he to return to wind - beaten
100,11,96,"Ilius, exulting in his chariot and his horses; ere he could do"
100,11,97,"so, death of ill - omened name had overshadowed him and he had"
100,11,98,fallen by the spear of Idomeneus the noble son of Deucalion. He
100,11,99,"had driven towards the left wing of the ships, by which way the"
100,11,100,Achaeans used to return with their chariots and horses from the
100,11,101,plain. Hither he drove and found the gates with their doors
100,11,102,"opened wide, and the great bar down — for the gatemen kept them"
100,11,103,open so as to let those of their comrades enter who might be
100,11,104,flying towards the ships. Hither of set purpose did he direct his
100,11,105,"horses, and his men followed him with a loud cry, for they felt"
100,11,106,"sure that the Achaeans would not hold out longer, and that they"
100,11,107,should now fall upon the ships. Little did they know that at the
100,11,108,"gates they should find two of the bravest chieftains, proud sons"
100,11,109,"of the fighting Lapithae — the one, Polypoetes, mighty son of"
100,11,110,"Pirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous Mars. These"
100,11,111,stood before the gates like two high oak trees upon the
100,11,112,"mountains, that tower from their wide - spreading roots, and year"
100,11,113,after year battle with wind and rain — even so did these two men
100,11,114,await the onset of great Asius confidently and without flinching.
100,11,115,"The Trojans led by him and by Iamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of"
100,11,116,"Asius, Thoon and Oenomaus, raised a loud cry of battle and made"
100,11,117,"straight for the wall, holding their shields of dry ox - hide above"
100,11,118,their heads; for a while the two defenders remained inside and
100,11,119,cheered the Achaeans on to stand firm in the defence of their
100,11,120,"ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojans were attacking"
100,11,121,"the wall, while the Danaans were crying out for help and being"
100,11,122,"routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of the gates like"
100,11,123,two wild boars upon the mountains that abide the attack of men
100,11,124,"and dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all"
100,11,125,"round them tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the"
100,11,126,"clattering of their tusks, till some one hits them and makes an"
100,11,127,end of them — even so did the gleaming bronze rattle about their
100,11,128,"breasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they fought with"
100,11,129,"great fury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were"
100,11,130,on the wall above them. These threw great stones at their
100,11,131,assailants in defence of themselves their tents and their ships.
100,11,132,The stones fell thick as the flakes of snow which some fierce
100,11,133,blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down in sheets upon
100,11,134,the earth — even so fell the weapons from the hands alike of
100,11,135,Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the great
100,11,136,"stones rained upon them, and Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, in his"
100,11,137,"dismay cried aloud and smote his two thighs. “Father Jove,” he"
100,11,138,"cried, “of a truth you too are altogether given to lying. I made"
100,11,139,"sure the Argive heroes could not withstand us, whereas like"
100,11,140,"slim - waisted wasps, or bees that have their nests in the rocks by"
100,11,141,the wayside — they leave not the holes wherein they have built
100,11,142,"undefended, but fight for their little ones against all who would"
100,11,143,"take them — even so these men, though they be but two, will not be"
100,11,144,"driven from the gates, but stand firm either to slay or be"
100,11,145,slain.”
100,11,146,"He spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then"
100,11,147,was to give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans
100,11,148,"were fighting about the other gates; I, however, am no god to be"
100,11,149,"able to tell about all these things, for the battle raged"
100,11,150,everywhere about the stone wall as it were a fiery furnace. The
100,11,151,"Argives, discomfited though they were, were forced to defend"
100,11,152,"their ships, and all the gods who were defending the Achaeans"
100,11,153,were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithae kept on fighting with
100,11,154,might and main.
100,11,155,"Thereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a"
100,11,156,spear upon his cheek - pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect
100,11,157,"him, for the point of the spear went through it, and broke the"
100,11,158,"bone, so that the brain inside was scattered about, and he died"
100,11,159,"fighting. He then slew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race"
100,11,160,"of Mars, killed Hippomachus the son of Antimachus by striking him"
100,11,161,with his spear upon the girdle. He then drew his sword and sprang
100,11,162,"first upon Antiphates whom he killed in combat, and who fell face"
100,11,163,"upwards on the earth. After him he killed Menon, Iamenus, and"
100,11,164,"Orestes, and laid them low one after the other."
100,11,165,"While they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the"
100,11,166,youths who were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were
100,11,167,the greater part and the most valiant of those that were trying
100,11,168,to break through the wall and fire the ships) were still standing
100,11,169,"by the trench, uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a"
100,11,170,sign from heaven when they had essayed to cross it — a soaring
100,11,171,"eagle that flew skirting the left wing of their host, with a"
100,11,172,monstrous blood - red snake in its talons still alive and
100,11,173,"struggling to escape. The snake was still bent on revenge,"
100,11,174,wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it struck the bird
100,11,175,"that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird being in"
100,11,176,"pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host, and"
100,11,177,then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were struck
100,11,178,"with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis - bearing"
100,11,179,"Jove, writhing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to"
100,11,180,"Hector and said, “Hector, at our councils of war you are ever"
100,11,181,"given to rebuke me, even when I speak wisely, as though it were"
100,11,182,"not well, forsooth, that one of the people should cross your will"
100,11,183,either in the field or at the council board; you would have them
100,11,184,support you always: nevertheless I will say what I think will be
100,11,185,"best; let us not now go on to fight the Danaans at their ships,"
100,11,186,for I know what will happen if this soaring eagle which skirted
100,11,187,the left wing of our host with a monstrous blood - red snake in its
100,11,188,talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent as an omen
100,11,189,to the Trojans on their essaying to cross the trench. The eagle
100,11,190,let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking it home to her
100,11,191,"little ones, and so will it be — with ourselves; even though by a"
100,11,192,mighty effort we break through the gates and wall of the
100,11,193,"Achaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall not return"
100,11,194,"in good order by the way we came, but shall leave many a man"
100,11,195,behind us whom the Achaeans will do to death in defence of their
100,11,196,"ships. Thus would any seer who was expert in these matters, and"
100,11,197,"was trusted by the people, read the portent.”"
100,11,198,"Hector looked fiercely at him and said, “Polydamas, I like not of"
100,11,199,your reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will.
100,11,200,"If, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has"
100,11,201,heaven robbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed
100,11,202,"to the counsels of Jove, nor to the promises he made me — and he"
100,11,203,bowed his head in confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the
100,11,204,flight of wild - fowl. What care I whether they fly towards dawn or
100,11,205,"dark, and whether they be on my right hand or on my left? Let us"
100,11,206,"put our trust rather in the counsel of great Jove, king of"
100,11,207,"mortals and immortals. There is one omen, and one only — that a man"
100,11,208,should fight for his country. Why are you so fearful? Though we
100,11,209,be all of us slain at the ships of the Argives you are not likely
100,11,210,"to be killed yourself, for you are not steadfast nor courageous."
100,11,211,"If you will not fight, or would talk others over from doing so,"
100,11,212,you shall fall forthwith before my spear.”
100,11,213,"With these words he led the way, and the others followed after"
100,11,214,with a cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent
100,11,215,"the blast of a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore"
100,11,216,the dust down towards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into
100,11,217,"security, and gave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who,"
100,11,218,"trusting to their own might and to the signs he had shown them,"
100,11,219,essayed to break through the great wall of the Achaeans. They
100,11,220,"tore down the breastworks from the walls, and overthrew the"
100,11,221,"battlements; they upheaved the buttresses, which the Achaeans had"
100,11,222,set in front of the wall in order to support it; when they had
100,11,223,"pulled these down they made sure of breaking through the wall,"
100,11,224,but the Danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they still
100,11,225,"fenced the battlements with their shields of ox - hide, and hurled"
100,11,226,their missiles down upon the foe as soon as any came below the
100,11,227,wall.
100,11,228,The two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the
100,11,229,"Achaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to"
100,11,230,"any one whom they saw to be remiss. “My friends,” they cried,"
100,11,231,"“Argives one and all — good bad and indifferent, for there was"
100,11,232,"never fight yet, in which all were of equal prowess — there is now"
100,11,233,"work enough, as you very well know, for all of you. See that you"
100,11,234,"none of you turn in flight towards the ships, daunted by the"
100,11,235,"shouting of the foe, but press forward and keep one another in"
100,11,236,"heart, if it may so be that Olympian Jove the lord of lightning"
100,11,237,"will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive them back towards"
100,11,238,the city.”
100,11,239,Thus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on.
100,11,240,"As the flakes that fall thick upon a winter’s day, when Jove is"
100,11,241,minded to snow and to display these his arrows to mankind — he
100,11,242,"lulls the wind to rest, and snows hour after hour till he has"
100,11,243,"buried the tops of the high mountains, the headlands that jut"
100,11,244,"into the sea, the grassy plains, and the tilled fields of men;"
100,11,245,"the snow lies deep upon the forelands, and havens of the grey"
100,11,246,"sea, but the waves as they come rolling in stay it that it can"
100,11,247,"come no further, though all else is wrapped as with a mantle, so"
100,11,248,heavy are the heavens with snow — even thus thickly did the stones
100,11,249,"fall on one side and on the other, some thrown at the Trojans,"
100,11,250,and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and the whole wall was
100,11,251,in an uproar.
100,11,252,Still the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down
100,11,253,"the gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedon"
100,11,254,against the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle.
100,11,255,"Before him he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith"
100,11,256,"had beaten so fair and round, and had lined with ox hides which"
100,11,257,he had made fast with rivets of gold all round the shield; this
100,11,258,"he held in front of him, and brandishing his two spears came on"
100,11,259,"like some lion of the wilderness, who has been long famished for"
100,11,260,want of meat and will dare break even into a well - fenced
100,11,261,homestead to try and get at the sheep. He may find the shepherds
100,11,262,"keeping watch over their flocks with dogs and spears, but he is"
100,11,263,in no mind to be driven from the fold till he has had a try for
100,11,264,"it; he will either spring on a sheep and carry it off, or be hit"
100,11,265,by a spear from some strong hand — even so was Sarpedon fain to
100,11,266,attack the wall and break down its battlements. Then he said to
100,11,267,"Glaucus son of Hippolochus, “Glaucus, why in Lycia do we receive"
100,11,268,especial honour as regards our place at table? Why are the
100,11,269,"choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why"
100,11,270,do men look up to us as though we were gods? Moreover we hold a
100,11,271,"large estate by the banks of the river Xanthus, fair with orchard"
100,11,272,"lawns and wheat - growing land; it becomes us, therefore, to take"
100,11,273,our stand at the head of all the Lycians and bear the brunt of
100,11,274,"the fight, that one may say to another, ‘Our princes in Lycia eat"
100,11,275,"the fat of the land and drink best of wine, but they are fine"
100,11,276,fellows; they fight well and are ever at the front in battle.’ My
100,11,277,"good friend, if, when we were once out of this fight, we could"
100,11,278,"escape old age and death thenceforward and forever, I should"
100,11,279,"neither press forward myself nor bid you do so, but death in ten"
100,11,280,"thousand shapes hangs ever over our heads, and no man can elude"
100,11,281,him; therefore let us go forward and either win glory for
100,11,282,"ourselves, or yield it to another.”"
100,11,283,"Glaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host"
100,11,284,of Lycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw
100,11,285,"them, for it was against his part of the wall that they"
100,11,286,came — bringing destruction with them; he looked along the wall for
100,11,287,"some chieftain to support his comrades and saw the two Ajaxes,"
100,11,288,"men ever eager for the fray, and Teucer, who had just come from"
100,11,289,"his tent, standing near them; but he could not make his voice"
100,11,290,"heard by shouting to them, so great an uproar was there from"
100,11,291,crashing shields and helmets and the battering of gates with a
100,11,292,"din which reached the skies. For all the gates had been closed,"
100,11,293,and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and break their way
100,11,294,"through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with a message"
100,11,295,"to Ajax. “Run, good Thootes,” he said, “and call Ajax, or better"
100,11,296,"still bid both come, for it will be all over with us here"
100,11,297,"directly; the leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have"
100,11,298,ever fought desperately heretofore. But if they have too much on
100,11,299,"their hands to let them come, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon"
100,11,300,"do so, and let Teucer, the famous bowman, come with him.”"
100,11,301,"The messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the"
100,11,302,"wall of the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them,"
100,11,303,"“Sirs, princes of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you"
100,11,304,come to him for a while and help him. You had better both come if
100,11,305,"you can, or it will be all over with him directly; the leaders of"
100,11,306,"the Lycians are upon him, men who have ever fought desperately"
100,11,307,"heretofore; if you have too much on your hands to let both come,"
100,11,308,"at any rate let Ajax, son of Telamon, do so, and let Teucer, the"
100,11,309,"famous bowman, come with him.”"
100,11,310,"Great Ajax son of Telamon heeded the message, and at once spoke"
100,11,311,"to the son of Oileus. “Ajax,” said he, “do you two, yourself and"
100,11,312,"brave Lycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight"
100,11,313,"their hardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the"
100,11,314,"fray, but I will come back here at once as soon as I have given"
100,11,315,them the help they need.”
100,11,316,"With this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer, his brother"
100,11,317,"by the same father, went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer’s"
100,11,318,"bow. They went along inside the wall, and when they came to the"
100,11,319,tower where Menestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find
100,11,320,him) the brave captains and leaders of the Lycians were storming
100,11,321,"the battlements as it were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close"
100,11,322,"quarters, and raising the battle - cry aloud."
100,11,323,"First, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of"
100,11,324,"Sarpedon, hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the"
100,11,325,"battlements at the very top of the wall. As men now are, even one"
100,11,326,who is in the bloom of youth could hardly lift it with his two
100,11,327,"hands, but Ajax raised it high aloft and flung it down, smashing"
100,11,328,Epicles’ four - crested helmet so that the bones of his head were
100,11,329,"crushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as though he"
100,11,330,"were diving, with no more life left in him. Then Teucer wounded"
100,11,331,Glaucus the brave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on to
100,11,332,attack the wall. He saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at
100,11,333,"it, which made Glaucus leave off fighting. Thereon he sprang"
100,11,334,covertly down for fear some of the Achaeans might see that he was
100,11,335,wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was stung with grief when he saw
100,11,336,"Glaucus leave him, still he did not leave off fighting, but aimed"
100,11,337,his spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor and hit him. He drew his
100,11,338,spear back again and Alcmaon came down headlong after it with his
100,11,339,bronzed armour rattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized the
100,11,340,"battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it till it all gave"
100,11,341,"way together, and a breach was made through which many might"
100,11,342,pass.
100,11,343,Ajax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him
100,11,344,with an arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his
100,11,345,"body, but Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not"
100,11,346,fall by the ships’ sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and
100,11,347,"pierced his shield, but the spear did not go clean through,"
100,11,348,though it hustled him back that he could come on no further. He
100,11,349,"therefore retired a little space from the battlement, yet without"
100,11,350,"losing all his ground, for he still thought to cover himself with"
100,11,351,glory. Then he turned round and shouted to the brave Lycians
100,11,352,"saying, “Lycians, why do you thus fail me? For all my prowess I"
100,11,353,cannot break through the wall and open a way to the ships
100,11,354,"single - handed. Come close on behind me, for the more there are of"
100,11,355,us the better.”
100,11,356,"The Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who"
100,11,357,was their counsellor and their king. The Argives on their part
100,11,358,"got their men in fighting order within the wall, and there was a"
100,11,359,deadly struggle between them. The Lycians could not break through
100,11,360,"the wall and force their way to the ships, nor could the Danaans"
100,11,361,drive the Lycians from the wall now that they had once reached
100,11,362,"it. As two men, measuring - rods in hand, quarrel about their"
100,11,363,"boundaries in a field that they own in common, and stickle for"
100,11,364,"their rights though they be but in a mere strip, even so did the"
100,11,365,"battlements now serve as a bone of contention, and they beat one"
100,11,366,another’s round shields for their possession. Many a man’s body
100,11,367,"was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round and"
100,11,368,"bared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean through"
100,11,369,their shields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged
100,11,370,with the blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans. But even so the
100,11,371,"Trojans could not rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as"
100,11,372,some honest hard - working woman weighs wool in her balance and
100,11,373,"sees that the scales be true, for she would gain some pitiful"
100,11,374,"earnings for her little ones, even so was the fight balanced"
100,11,375,evenly between them till the time came when Jove gave the greater
100,11,376,"glory to Hector son of Priam, who was first to spring towards the"
100,11,377,"wall of the Achaeans. When he had done so, he cried aloud to the"
100,11,378,"Trojans, “Up, Trojans, break the wall of the Argives, and fling"
100,11,379,fire upon their ships.”
100,11,380,"Thus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight"
100,11,381,"at the wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements"
100,11,382,with sharp spears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone
100,11,383,that lay just outside the gates and was thick at one end but
100,11,384,"pointed at the other; two of the best men in a town, as men now"
100,11,385,"are, could hardly raise it from the ground and put it on to a"
100,11,386,"waggon, but Hector lifted it quite easily by himself, for the son"
100,11,387,of scheming Saturn made it light for him. As a shepherd picks up
100,11,388,"a ram’s fleece with one hand and finds it no burden, so easily"
100,11,389,did Hector lift the great stone and drive it right at the doors
100,11,390,that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set. These doors
100,11,391,"were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross - bars to"
100,11,392,"which there was but one key. When he had got close up to them,"
100,11,393,Hector strode towards them that his blow might gain in force and
100,11,394,"struck them in the middle, leaning his whole weight against them."
100,11,395,"He broke both hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its"
100,11,396,"great weight. The portals re - echoed with the sound, the bars held"
100,11,397,"no longer, and the doors flew open, one one way, and the other"
100,11,398,"the other, through the force of the blow. Then brave Hector"
100,11,399,leaped inside with a face as dark as that of flying night. The
100,11,400,gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had two
100,11,401,spears in his hand. None but a god could have withstood him as he
100,11,402,"flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared like fire."
100,11,403,Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called on them to
100,11,404,"scale the wall, and they did as he bade them — some of them at once"
100,11,405,"climbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates."
100,11,406,"The Danaans then fled panic - stricken towards their ships, and all"
100,11,407,was uproar and confusion.
100,12,1,Neptune helps the Achaeans — The feats of Idomeneus — Hector at the
100,12,2,ships.
100,12,3,Now when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the
100,12,4,"ships, he left them to their never - ending toil, and turned his"
100,12,5,"keen eyes away, looking elsewhither towards the horse - breeders of"
100,12,6,"Thrace, the Mysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble"
100,12,7,"Hippemolgi, who live on milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind."
100,12,8,"He no longer turned so much as a glance towards Troy, for he did"
100,12,9,not think that any of the immortals would go and help either
100,12,10,Trojans or Danaans.
100,12,11,But King Neptune had kept no blind look - out; he had been looking
100,12,12,admiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of
100,12,13,"wooded Samothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of"
100,12,14,Priam and the ships of the Achaeans. He had come from under the
100,12,15,"sea and taken his place here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were"
100,12,16,being overcome by the Trojans; and he was furiously angry with
100,12,17,Jove.
100,12,18,"Presently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as"
100,12,19,he strode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked
100,12,20,"beneath the tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took,"
100,12,21,"and with the fourth he reached his goal — Aegae, where is his"
100,12,22,"glittering golden palace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea."
100,12,23,"When he got there, he yoked his fleet brazen - footed steeds with"
100,12,24,their manes of gold all flying in the wind; he clothed himself in
100,12,25,"raiment of gold, grasped his gold whip, and took his stand upon"
100,12,26,his chariot. As he went his way over the waves the sea - monsters
100,12,27,"left their lairs, for they knew their lord, and came gambolling"
100,12,28,"round him from every quarter of the deep, while the sea in her"
100,12,29,gladness opened a path before his chariot. So lightly did the
100,12,30,horses fly that the bronze axle of the car was not even wet
100,12,31,beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him to the ships of
100,12,32,the Achaeans.
100,12,33,Now there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea
100,12,34,midway between Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the
100,12,35,"earthquake stayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them"
100,12,36,their ambrosial forage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of
100,12,37,"gold which none could either unloose or break, so that they might"
100,12,38,stay there in that place until their lord should return. This
100,12,39,done he went his way to the host of the Achaeans.
100,12,40,Now the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like
100,12,41,"a storm - cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and"
100,12,42,raising the cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the
100,12,43,ships of the Achaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and
100,12,44,there. Meanwhile earth - encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake
100,12,45,"cheered on the Argives, for he had come up out of the sea and had"
100,12,46,assumed the form and voice of Calchas.
100,12,47,"First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best"
100,12,48,"already, and said, “Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the"
100,12,49,Achaeans if you will put out all your strength and not let
100,12,50,"yourselves be daunted. I am not afraid that the Trojans, who have"
100,12,51,"got over the wall in force, will be victorious in any other part,"
100,12,52,"for the Achaeans can hold all of them in check, but I much fear"
100,12,53,"that some evil will befall us here where furious Hector, who"
100,12,54,"boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, is leading them on"
100,12,55,"like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it into your"
100,12,56,"hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to do the"
100,12,57,like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even though
100,12,58,he be inspired by Jove himself.”
100,12,59,As he spoke the earth - encircling lord of the earthquake struck
100,12,60,both of them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with
100,12,61,"daring. He made their legs light and active, as also their hands"
100,12,62,"and their feet. Then, as the soaring falcon poises on the wing"
100,12,63,"high above some sheer rock, and presently swoops down to chase"
100,12,64,"some bird over the plain, even so did Neptune lord of the"
100,12,65,earthquake wing his flight into the air and leave them. Of the
100,12,66,"two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first to know who it was"
100,12,67,"that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax son of"
100,12,68,"Telamon, “Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus,"
100,12,69,who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by
100,12,70,our ships. It was not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I
100,12,71,"knew him at once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the"
100,12,72,gods are soon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn
100,12,73,"more fiercely within me, while my hands and my feet under me are"
100,12,74,more eager for the fray.”
100,12,75,"And Ajax son of Telamon answered, “I too feel my hands grasp my"
100,12,76,"spear more firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more"
100,12,77,"nimble; I long, moreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam,"
100,12,78,even in single combat.”
100,12,79,"Thus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with"
100,12,80,which the god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth - encircler
100,12,81,"roused the Achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships"
100,12,82,overcome at once by hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the
100,12,83,Trojans had got over the wall in force. Tears began falling from
100,12,84,"their eyes as they beheld them, for they made sure that they"
100,12,85,should not escape destruction; but the lord of the earthquake
100,12,86,passed lightly about among them and urged their battalions to the
100,12,87,front.
100,12,88,"First he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and"
100,12,89,"Thoas and Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant"
100,12,90,"warriors; all did he exhort. “Shame on you young Argives,” he"
100,12,91,"cried, “it was on your prowess I relied for the saving of our"
100,12,92,"ships; if you fight not with might and main, this very day will"
100,12,93,see us overcome by the Trojans. Of a truth my eyes behold a great
100,12,94,and terrible portent which I had never thought to see — the Trojans
100,12,95,"at our ships — they, who were heretofore like panic - stricken hinds,"
100,12,96,"the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest, with no strength but"
100,12,97,in flight for they cannot defend themselves. Hitherto the Trojans
100,12,98,"dared not for one moment face the attack of the Achaeans, but now"
100,12,99,they have sallied far from their city and are fighting at our
100,12,100,very ships through the cowardice of our leader and the
100,12,101,"disaffection of the people themselves, who in their discontent"
100,12,102,care not to fight in defence of the ships but are being
100,12,103,"slaughtered near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus is the"
100,12,104,"cause of our disaster by having insulted the son of Peleus, still"
100,12,105,this is no reason why we should leave off fighting. Let us be
100,12,106,"quick to heal, for the hearts of the brave heal quickly. You do"
100,12,107,"ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest soldiers in our"
100,12,108,whole army. I blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is a
100,12,109,"weakling, but I am indignant with such men as you are. My good"
100,12,110,"friends, matters will soon become even worse through this"
100,12,111,"slackness; think, each one of you, of his own honour and credit,"
100,12,112,for the hazard of the fight is extreme. Great Hector is now
100,12,113,fighting at our ships; he has broken through the gates and the
100,12,114,strong bolt that held them.”
100,12,115,Thus did the earth - encircler address the Achaeans and urge them
100,12,116,on. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of
100,12,117,"men, of whom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could"
100,12,118,"make light if they went among them, for they were the picked men"
100,12,119,of all those who were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the
100,12,120,"Trojans. They made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to"
100,12,121,"shield, buckler to buckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man. The"
100,12,122,horse - hair crests on their gleaming helmets touched one another
100,12,123,"as they nodded forward, so closely serried were they; the spears"
100,12,124,"they brandished in their strong hands were interlaced, and their"
100,12,125,hearts were set on battle.
100,12,126,"The Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head"
100,12,127,pressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side
100,12,128,of some mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn
100,12,129,it; the foundations of the dull thing have been loosened by
100,12,130,"floods of rain, and as it bounds headlong on its way it sets the"
100,12,131,whole forest in an uproar; it swerves neither to right nor left
100,12,132,"till it reaches level ground, but then for all its fury it can go"
100,12,133,no further — even so easily did Hector for a while seem as though
100,12,134,he would career through the tents and ships of the Achaeans till
100,12,135,he had reached the sea in his murderous course; but the closely
100,12,136,"serried battalions stayed him when he reached them, for the sons"
100,12,137,of the Achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears pointed at
100,12,138,"both ends, and drove him from them so that he staggered and gave"
100,12,139,"ground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, “Trojans, Lycians, and"
100,12,140,"Dardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans"
100,12,141,"have set themselves as a wall against me, but they will not check"
100,12,142,me for long; they will give ground before me if the mightiest of
100,12,143,"the gods, the thundering spouse of Juno, has indeed inspired my"
100,12,144,onset.”
100,12,145,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus
100,12,146,son of Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with
100,12,147,"his round shield before him, under cover of which he strode"
100,12,148,"quickly forward. Meriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did"
100,12,149,he fail to hit the broad orb of ox - hide; but he was far from
100,12,150,piercing it for the spear broke in two pieces long ere he could
100,12,151,do so; moreover Deiphobus had seen it coming and had held his
100,12,152,shield well away from him. Meriones drew back under cover of his
100,12,153,"comrades, angry alike at having failed to vanquish Deiphobus, and"
100,12,154,having broken his spear. He turned therefore towards the ships
100,12,155,and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind in his tent.
100,12,156,"The others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into"
100,12,157,"the heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man,"
100,12,158,"to wit, the warrior Imbrius, son of Mentor, rich in horses. Until"
100,12,159,"the Achaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married"
100,12,160,"Medesicaste, a bastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of"
100,12,161,"the Danaan fleet he had gone back to Ilius, and was a great man"
100,12,162,"among the Trojans, dwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like"
100,12,163,honour with his own sons. The son of Telamon now struck him under
100,12,164,"the ear with a spear which he then drew back again, and Imbrius"
100,12,165,fell headlong as an ash - tree when it is felled on the crest of
100,12,166,"some high mountain beacon, and its delicate green foliage comes"
100,12,167,toppling down to the ground. Thus did he fall with his
100,12,168,"bronze - dight armour ringing harshly round him, and Teucer sprang"
100,12,169,forward with intent to strip him of his armour; but as he was
100,12,170,"doing so, Hector took aim at him with a spear. Teucer saw the"
100,12,171,"spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit Amphimachus, son"
100,12,172,"of Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he was coming into"
100,12,173,"battle, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily"
100,12,174,to the ground. Hector sprang forward to take Amphimachus’s helmet
100,12,175,"from off his temples, and in a moment Ajax threw a spear at him,"
100,12,176,"but did not wound him, for he was encased all over in his"
100,12,177,terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of his
100,12,178,"shield with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses,"
100,12,179,"which the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus,"
100,12,180,"captains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to the host of"
100,12,181,"the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the"
100,12,182,like by Imbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that
100,12,183,"have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high"
100,12,184,"above the ground in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft"
100,12,185,"the body of Imbrius, and strip it of its armour. Then the son of"
100,12,186,Oileus severed the head from the neck in revenge for the death of
100,12,187,"Amphimachus, and sent it whirling over the crowd as though it had"
100,12,188,"been a ball, till it fell in the dust at Hector’s feet."
100,12,189,Neptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus
100,12,190,should have fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of
100,12,191,"the Achaeans to urge the Danaans still further, and to devise"
100,12,192,"evil for the Trojans. Idomeneus met him, as he was taking leave"
100,12,193,"of a comrade, who had just come to him from the fight, wounded in"
100,12,194,"the knee. His fellow - soldiers bore him off the field, and"
100,12,195,Idomeneus having given orders to the physicians went on to his
100,12,196,"tent, for he was still thirsting for battle. Neptune spoke in the"
100,12,197,likeness and with the voice of Thoas son of Andraemon who ruled
100,12,198,"the Aetolians of all Pleuron and high Calydon, and was honoured"
100,12,199,"among his people as though he were a god. “Idomeneus,” said he,"
100,12,200,"“lawgiver to the Cretans, what has now become of the threats with"
100,12,201,which the sons of the Achaeans used to threaten the Trojans?”
100,12,202,"And Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, “Thoas, no one,"
100,12,203,"so far as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are"
100,12,204,"held back neither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the"
100,12,205,will of almighty Jove that the Achaeans should perish
100,12,206,"ingloriously here far from Argos: you, Thoas, have been always"
100,12,207,"staunch, and you keep others in heart if you see any fail in"
100,12,208,"duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to do their utmost.”"
100,12,209,"To this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, “Idomeneus,"
100,12,210,"may he never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten"
100,12,211,"upon, who is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour"
100,12,212,"and go, we must make all haste together if we may be of any use,"
100,12,213,though we are only two. Even cowards gain courage from
100,12,214,"companionship, and we two can hold our own with the bravest.”"
100,12,215,"Therewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and"
100,12,216,"Idomeneus when he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped"
100,12,217,"his two spears, and sallied forth. As the lightning which the son"
100,12,218,of Saturn brandishes from bright Olympus when he would show a
100,12,219,"sign to mortals, and its gleam flashes far and wide — even so did"
100,12,220,his armour gleam about him as he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire
100,12,221,met him while he was still near his tent (for he was going to
100,12,222,fetch his spear) and Idomeneus said:
100,12,223,"“Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you"
100,12,224,"left the field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon"
100,12,225,hurting you? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no
100,12,226,fetching; I had far rather fight than stay in my tent.”
100,12,227,"“Idomeneus,” answered Meriones, “I come for a spear, if I can"
100,12,228,"find one in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it"
100,12,229,at the shield of Deiphobus.”
100,12,230,"And Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, “You will find one"
100,12,231,"spear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end"
100,12,232,wall of my tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have
100,12,233,"killed, for I am not one to keep my enemy at arm’s length;"
100,12,234,"therefore I have spears, bossed shields, helmets, and burnished"
100,12,235,corslets.”
100,12,236,"Then Meriones said, “I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils"
100,12,237,"taken from the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at"
100,12,238,"all times valorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting"
100,12,239,have held my own among the foremost. There may be those among the
100,12,240,"Achaeans who do not know how I fight, but you know it well enough"
100,12,241,yourself.”
100,12,242,"Idomeneus answered, “I know you for a brave man: you need not"
100,12,243,tell me. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on
100,12,244,an ambush — and there is nothing like this for showing what a man
100,12,245,is made of; it comes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the
100,12,246,coward will change colour at every touch and turn; he is full of
100,12,247,"fears, and keeps shifting his weight first on one knee and then"
100,12,248,"on the other; his heart beats fast as he thinks of death, and one"
100,12,249,can hear the chattering of his teeth; whereas the brave man will
100,12,250,"not change colour nor be frightened on finding himself in ambush,"
100,12,251,but is all the time longing to go into action — if the best men
100,12,252,"were being chosen for such a service, no one could make light of"
100,12,253,your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck by a dart or
100,12,254,"smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind, in your"
100,12,255,"neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or belly"
100,12,256,as you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks. But
100,12,257,"let us no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill"
100,12,258,"spoken of; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once.”"
100,12,259,"On this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself"
100,12,260,"a spear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with"
100,12,261,great deeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to
100,12,262,"battle, and his son Panic so strong and dauntless goes with him,"
100,12,263,to strike terror even into the heart of a hero — the pair have gone
100,12,264,from Thrace to arm themselves among the Ephyri or the brave
100,12,265,"Phlegyans, but they will not listen to both the contending hosts,"
100,12,266,and will give victory to one side or to the other — even so did
100,12,267,"Meriones and Idomeneus, captains of men, go out to battle clad in"
100,12,268,their bronze armour. Meriones was first to speak. “Son of
100,12,269,"Deucalion,” said he, “where would you have us begin fighting? On"
100,12,270,"the right wing of the host, in the centre, or on the left wing,"
100,12,271,where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?”
100,12,272,"Idomeneus answered, “There are others to defend the centre — the"
100,12,273,"two Ajaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the"
100,12,274,"Achaeans, and is good also in a hand - to - hand fight. These will"
100,12,275,"give Hector son of Priam enough to do; fight as he may, he will"
100,12,276,"find it hard to vanquish their indomitable fury, and fire the"
100,12,277,"ships, unless the son of Saturn fling a firebrand upon them with"
100,12,278,his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon will yield to no man who
100,12,279,"is in mortal mould and eats the grain of Ceres, if bronze and"
100,12,280,great stones can overthrow him. He would not yield even to
100,12,281,"Achilles in hand - to - hand fight, and in fleetness of foot there is"
100,12,282,"none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards the left wing,"
100,12,283,that we may know forthwith whether we are to give glory to some
100,12,284,"other, or he to us.”"
100,12,285,"Meriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to"
100,12,286,the part of the host which Idomeneus had named.
100,12,287,Now when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of
100,12,288,"fire, him and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour,"
100,12,289,"they shouted and made towards him all in a body, and a furious"
100,12,290,hand - to - hand fight raged under the ships’ sterns. Fierce as the
100,12,291,shrill winds that whistle upon a day when dust lies deep on the
100,12,292,"roads, and the gusts raise it into a thick cloud — even such was"
100,12,293,"the fury of the combat, and might and main did they hack at each"
100,12,294,other with spear and sword throughout the host. The field
100,12,295,bristled with the long and deadly spears which they bore.
100,12,296,"Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their"
100,12,297,"fresh - burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they"
100,12,298,joined battle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage
100,12,299,"who could take pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look"
100,12,300,on it without being dismayed.
100,12,301,Thus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal
100,12,302,heroes. Jove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to
100,12,303,"Hector, so as to do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did"
100,12,304,"not mean to utterly overthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, and"
100,12,305,only wanted to glorify Thetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the
100,12,306,"other hand went about among the Argives to incite them, having"
100,12,307,"come up from the grey sea in secret, for he was grieved at seeing"
100,12,308,"them vanquished by the Trojans, and was furiously angry with"
100,12,309,"Jove. Both were of the same race and country, but Jove was elder"
100,12,310,"born and knew more, therefore Neptune feared to defend the"
100,12,311,"Argives openly, but in the likeness of man, he kept on"
100,12,312,"encouraging them throughout their host. Thus, then, did these two"
100,12,313,"devise a knot of war and battle, that none could unloose or"
100,12,314,"break, and set both sides tugging at it, to the failing of men’s"
100,12,315,knees beneath them.
100,12,316,"And now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,"
100,12,317,called loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as
100,12,318,"he leaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a"
100,12,319,"sojourner, who had but lately come to take part in the war. He"
100,12,320,"sought Cassandra, the fairest of Priam’s daughters, in marriage,"
100,12,321,"but offered no gifts of wooing, for he promised a great thing, to"
100,12,322,"wit, that he would drive the sons of the Achaeans willy nilly"
100,12,323,from Troy; old King Priam had given his consent and promised her
100,12,324,"to him, whereon he fought on the strength of the promises thus"
100,12,325,"made to him. Idomeneus aimed a spear, and hit him as he came"
100,12,326,"striding on. His cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the"
100,12,327,"spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily to the ground."
100,12,328,"Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying, “Othryoneus, there is no"
100,12,329,"one in the world whom I shall admire more than I do you, if you"
100,12,330,indeed perform what you have promised Priam son of Dardanus in
100,12,331,return for his daughter. We too will make you an offer; we will
100,12,332,"give you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus, and will"
100,12,333,"bring her from Argos for you to marry, if you will sack the"
100,12,334,goodly city of Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along
100,12,335,"with me, that we may make a covenant at the ships about the"
100,12,336,"marriage, and we will not be hard upon you about gifts of"
100,12,337,wooing.”
100,12,338,With this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the
100,12,339,"thick of the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on"
100,12,340,"foot, in front of his horses which his esquire drove so close"
100,12,341,behind him that he could feel their breath upon his shoulder. He
100,12,342,"was longing to strike down Idomeneus, but ere he could do so"
100,12,343,"Idomeneus smote him with his spear in the throat under the chin,"
100,12,344,"and the bronze point went clean through it. He fell as an oak, or"
100,12,345,"poplar, or pine which shipwrights have felled for ship’s timber"
100,12,346,upon the mountains with whetted axes — even thus did he lie full
100,12,347,"length in front of his chariot and horses, grinding his teeth and"
100,12,348,clutching at the bloodstained dust. His charioteer was struck
100,12,349,with panic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape:
100,12,350,thereupon Antilochus hit him in the middle of his body with a
100,12,351,"spear; his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the spear"
100,12,352,stuck in his belly. He fell gasping from his chariot and
100,12,353,"Antilochus, great Nestor’s son, drove his horses from the Trojans"
100,12,354,to the Achaeans.
100,12,355,"Deiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and"
100,12,356,"took aim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look - out"
100,12,357,"and avoided it, for he was covered by the round shield he always"
100,12,358,bore — a shield of oxhide and bronze with two arm - rods on the
100,12,359,"inside. He crouched under cover of this, and the spear flew over"
100,12,360,"him, but the shield rang out as the spear grazed it, and the"
100,12,361,"weapon sped not in vain from the strong hand of Deiphobus, for it"
100,12,362,"struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus, shepherd of his people, in the"
100,12,363,"liver under the midriff, and his limbs failed beneath him."
100,12,364,"Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,"
100,12,365,“Of a truth Asius has not fallen unavenged; he will be glad even
100,12,366,"while passing into the house of Hades, strong warden of the gate,"
100,12,367,that I have sent some one to escort him.”
100,12,368,"Thus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying."
100,12,369,"Noble Antilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not"
100,12,370,"make him forget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him,"
100,12,371,"bestrode him, and covered him with his shield; then two of his"
100,12,372,"staunch comrades, Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, stooped"
100,12,373,"down, and bore him away groaning heavily to the ships. But"
100,12,374,Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He kept on striving continually
100,12,375,"either to enshroud some Trojan in the darkness of death, or"
100,12,376,himself to fall while warding off the evil day from the Achaeans.
100,12,377,Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes; he was son - in - law to
100,12,378,"Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia, who was"
100,12,379,"the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her"
100,12,380,"generation in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding,"
100,12,381,wherefore the bravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife — him
100,12,382,"did Neptune lay low by the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright"
100,12,383,eyes and binding his strong limbs in fetters so that he could
100,12,384,"neither go back nor to one side, but stood stock still like"
100,12,385,pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck him with a spear in
100,12,386,the middle of his chest. The coat of mail that had hitherto
100,12,387,"protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly as the spear"
100,12,388,"tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground, and the spear"
100,12,389,"stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt - end of"
100,12,390,the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life.
100,12,391,"Idomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,"
100,12,392,"“Deiphobus, since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits"
100,12,393,"now that we have killed three men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in"
100,12,394,"fight with me yourself, that you may learn what manner of"
100,12,395,Jove - begotten man am I that have come hither. Jove first begot
100,12,396,"Minos, chief ruler in Crete, and Minos in his turn begot a son,"
100,12,397,noble Deucalion. Deucalion begot me to be a ruler over many men
100,12,398,"in Crete, and my ships have now brought me hither, to be the bane"
100,12,399,"of yourself, your father, and the Trojans.”"
100,12,400,"Thus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go"
100,12,401,"back and fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the"
100,12,402,"challenge single - handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and"
100,12,403,"fetch Aeneas, whom he found standing in the rear, for he had long"
100,12,404,been aggrieved with Priam because in spite of his brave deeds he
100,12,405,did not give him his due share of honour. Deiphobus went up to
100,12,406,"him and said, “Aeneas, prince among the Trojans, if you know any"
100,12,407,"ties of kinship, help me now to defend the body of your sister’s"
100,12,408,"husband; come with me to the rescue of Alcathous, who being"
100,12,409,husband to your sister brought you up when you were a child in
100,12,410,"his house, and now Idomeneus has slain him.”"
100,12,411,"With these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in"
100,12,412,"pursuit of Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but"
100,12,413,Idomeneus was not to be thus daunted as though he were a mere
100,12,414,child; he held his ground as a wild boar at bay upon the
100,12,415,"mountains, who abides the coming of a great crowd of men in some"
100,12,416,"lonely place — the bristles stand upright on his back, his eyes"
100,12,417,"flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness to defend"
100,12,418,himself against hounds and men — even so did famed Idomeneus hold
100,12,419,his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud
100,12,420,"to his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus, Deipyrus,"
100,12,421,"Meriones, and Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers — “Hither my"
100,12,422,"friends,” he cried, “and leave me not single - handed — I go in great"
100,12,423,"fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is a"
100,12,424,redoubtable dispenser of death battle. Moreover he is in the
100,12,425,flower of youth when a man’s strength is greatest; if I was of
100,12,426,"the same age as he is and in my present mind, either he or I"
100,12,427,should soon bear away the prize of victory.”
100,12,428,"On this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on"
100,12,429,"shoulder. Aeneas on the other side called to his comrades,"
100,12,430,"looking towards Deiphobus, Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of"
100,12,431,"the Trojans along with himself, and the people followed them as"
100,12,432,sheep follow the ram when they go down to drink after they have
100,12,433,"been feeding, and the heart of the shepherd is glad — even so was"
100,12,434,the heart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him.
100,12,435,Then they fought furiously in close combat about the body of
100,12,436,"Alcathous, wielding their long spears; and the bronze armour"
100,12,437,about their bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at one another
100,12,438,"in the press of the fight, while the two heroes Aeneas and"
100,12,439,"Idomeneus, peers of Mars, outvied everyone in their desire to"
100,12,440,"hack at each other with sword and spear. Aeneas took aim first,"
100,12,441,"but Idomeneus was on the lookout and avoided the spear, so that"
100,12,442,"it sped from Aeneas’ strong hand in vain, and fell quivering in"
100,12,443,the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oenomaus in the middle of
100,12,444,"his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereon his bowels"
100,12,445,came gushing out and he clutched the earth in the palms of his
100,12,446,hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus drew his spear
100,12,447,"out of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his"
100,12,448,armour for the rain of darts that were showered upon him:
100,12,449,moreover his strength was now beginning to fail him so that he
100,12,450,"could no longer charge, and could neither spring forward to"
100,12,451,recover his own weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was
100,12,452,"aimed at him; therefore, though he still defended himself in"
100,12,453,"hand - to - hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear him swiftly out"
100,12,454,of the battle. Deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he was
100,12,455,"retreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him"
100,12,456,"was as fierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit"
100,12,457,"Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; the spear went through his shoulder,"
100,12,458,and he clutched the earth in the palms of his hands as he fell
100,12,459,sprawling in the dust.
100,12,460,Grim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had
100,12,461,"fallen, for he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the"
100,12,462,"golden clouds, by command of Jove, where the other gods were also"
100,12,463,"sitting, forbidden to take part in the battle. Meanwhile men"
100,12,464,fought furiously about the body. Deiphobus tore the helmet from
100,12,465,"off his head, but Meriones sprang upon him, and struck him on the"
100,12,466,arm with a spear so that the visored helmet fell from his hand
100,12,467,and came ringing down upon the ground. Thereon Meriones sprang
100,12,468,"upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from his shoulder, and"
100,12,469,"fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites, own brother of"
100,12,470,"Deiphobus passed his arms around his waist, and bore him away"
100,12,471,from the battle till he got to his horses that were standing in
100,12,472,the rear of the fight with the chariot and their driver. These
100,12,473,"took him towards the city groaning and in great pain, with the"
100,12,474,blood flowing from his arm.
100,12,475,"The others still fought on, and the battle - cry rose to heaven"
100,12,476,"without ceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and"
100,12,477,struck him with a spear in his throat which was turned towards
100,12,478,"him; his head fell on one side, his helmet and shield came down"
100,12,479,"along with him, and death, life’s foe, was shed around him."
100,12,480,"Antilochus spied his chance, flew forward towards Thoon, and"
100,12,481,wounded him as he was turning round. He laid open the vein that
100,12,482,runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cut this vein clean
100,12,483,"away throughout its whole course, and Thoon fell in the dust face"
100,12,484,"upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly towards his"
100,12,485,comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the armour from
100,12,486,"his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so. The"
100,12,487,Trojans came about him on every side and struck his broad and
100,12,488,"gleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptune stood"
100,12,489,"guard over the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thickly round"
100,12,490,"him. He was never clear of the foe, but was always in the thick"
100,12,491,of the fight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it in
100,12,492,"every direction, so eager was he to hit someone from a distance"
100,12,493,or to fight him hand to hand.
100,12,494,"As he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas, son"
100,12,495,"of Asius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in"
100,12,496,"the middle of his shield, but Neptune made its point without"
100,12,497,"effect, for he grudged him the life of Antilochus. One half,"
100,12,498,"therefore, of the spear stuck fast like a charred stake in"
100,12,499,"Antilochus’s shield, while the other lay on the ground. Adamas"
100,12,500,"then sought shelter under cover of his men, but Meriones followed"
100,12,501,after and hit him with a spear midway between the private parts
100,12,502,"and the navel, where a wound is particularly painful to wretched"
100,12,503,"mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed"
100,12,504,convulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen
100,12,505,have bound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce.
100,12,506,"Even so did he move convulsively for a while, but not for very"
100,12,507,"long, till Meriones came up and drew the spear out of his body,"
100,12,508,and his eyes were veiled in darkness.
100,12,509,"Helenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting"
100,12,510,him on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his
100,12,511,"head; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were"
100,12,512,fighting on the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at
100,12,513,"his feet, but the eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of"
100,12,514,death.
100,12,515,"On this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards"
100,12,516,"Helenus, brandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the"
100,12,517,"two attacked one another at one and the same moment, the one with"
100,12,518,"his spear, and the other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam"
100,12,519,"hit the breastplate of Menelaus’s corslet, but the arrow glanced"
100,12,520,from off it. As black beans or pulse come pattering down on to a
100,12,521,"threshing - floor from the broad winnowing - shovel, blown by shrill"
100,12,522,winds and shaken by the shovel — even so did the arrow glance off
100,12,523,"and recoil from the shield of Menelaus, who in his turn wounded"
100,12,524,the hand with which Helenus carried his bow; the spear went right
100,12,525,"through his hand and stuck in the bow itself, so that to his life"
100,12,526,"he retreated under cover of his men, with his hand dragging by"
100,12,527,his side — for the spear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out
100,12,528,and bound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which his
100,12,529,esquire had with him.
100,12,530,Pisander then made straight at Menelaus — his evil destiny luring
100,12,531,"him on to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O"
100,12,532,Menelaus. When the two were hard by one another the spear of the
100,12,533,son of Atreus turned aside and he missed his aim; Pisander then
100,12,534,"struck the shield of brave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for"
100,12,535,the shield stayed the spear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he
100,12,536,"was glad and made sure of victory; forthwith, however, the son of"
100,12,537,Atreus drew his sword and sprang upon him. Pisander then seized
100,12,538,"the bronze battle - axe, with its long and polished handle of olive"
100,12,539,"wood that hung by his side under his shield, and the two made at"
100,12,540,one another. Pisander struck the peak of Menelaus’s crested
100,12,541,"helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaus hit Pisander as"
100,12,542,"he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at the rise of"
100,12,543,his nose; the bones cracked and his two gore - bedrabbled eyes fell
100,12,544,"by his feet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground, and"
100,12,545,"Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and"
100,12,546,"vaunted over him saying, “Even thus shall you Trojans leave the"
100,12,547,"ships of the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle though you"
100,12,548,"be, nor shall you lack any of the disgrace and shame which you"
100,12,549,"have heaped upon myself. Cowardly she - wolves that you are, you"
100,12,550,"feared not the anger of dread Jove, avenger of violated"
100,12,551,"hospitality, who will one day destroy your city; you stole my"
100,12,552,wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were
100,12,553,"her guest, and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill"
100,12,554,"our heroes. A day will come when, rage as you may, you shall be"
100,12,555,"stayed. O father Jove, you, who they say art above all, both gods"
100,12,556,"and men, in wisdom, and from whom all things that befall us do"
100,12,557,"proceed, how can you thus favour the Trojans — men so proud and"
100,12,558,"overweening, that they are never tired of fighting? All things"
100,12,559,"pall after a while — sleep, love, sweet song, and stately"
100,12,560,dance — still these are things of which a man would surely have his
100,12,561,"fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of battle that the"
100,12,562,Trojans are insatiate.”
100,12,563,So saying Menelaus stripped the blood - stained armour from the
100,12,564,"body of Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again"
100,12,565,ranged himself among those who were in the front of the fight.
100,12,566,Harpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had
100,12,567,"come to fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go"
100,12,568,home again. He struck the middle of Menelaus’s shield with his
100,12,569,"spear but could not pierce it, and to save his life drew back"
100,12,570,"under cover of his men, looking round him on every side lest he"
100,12,571,should be wounded. But Meriones aimed a bronze - tipped arrow at
100,12,572,"him as he was leaving the field, and hit him on the right"
100,12,573,"buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through and through, and"
100,12,574,"penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and breathed"
100,12,575,"his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm upon"
100,12,576,the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed from
100,12,577,his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care;
100,12,578,"they raised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the"
100,12,579,"city of Troy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but"
100,12,580,there was no ransom that could bring his dead son to life again.
100,12,581,"Paris was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his"
100,12,582,"host when he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow,"
100,12,583,"therefore, in order to avenge him. Now there was a certain man"
100,12,584,"named Euchenor, son of Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and"
100,12,585,"wealthy, whose home was in Corinth. This Euchenor had set sail"
100,12,586,"for Troy well knowing that it would be the death of him, for his"
100,12,587,good old father Polyidus had often told him that he must either
100,12,588,"stay at home and die of a terrible disease, or go with the"
100,12,589,"Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans; he chose,"
100,12,590,"therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans would"
100,12,591,"have laid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain and"
100,12,592,suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on the jaw under his
100,12,593,"ear, whereon the life went out of him and he was enshrouded in"
100,12,594,the darkness of death.
100,12,595,Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector
100,12,596,"had not yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making"
100,12,597,"havoc of his men on the left wing of the battle, where the"
100,12,598,"Achaeans ere long would have triumphed over them, so vigorously"
100,12,599,did Neptune cheer them on and help them. He therefore held on at
100,12,600,the point where he had first forced his way through the gates and
100,12,601,"the wall, after breaking through the serried ranks of Danaan"
100,12,602,warriors. It was here that the ships of Ajax and Protesilaus were
100,12,603,"drawn up by the sea - shore; here the wall was at its lowest, and"
100,12,604,the fight both of man and horse raged most fiercely. The
100,12,605,"Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics, the Locrians,"
100,12,606,"the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans could"
100,12,607,"hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could"
100,12,608,"they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The"
100,12,609,"chosen men of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus"
100,12,610,"son of Peteos, with whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and"
100,12,611,"stalwart Bias; Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius"
100,12,612,"commanded the Epeans, while Medon and staunch Podarces led the"
100,12,613,"men of Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard son to Oileus and"
100,12,614,"brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own"
100,12,615,"country, for he had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis,"
100,12,616,"the wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was the son of Iphiclus,"
100,12,617,"son of Phylacus. These two stood in the van of the Phthians, and"
100,12,618,defended the ships along with the Boeotians.
100,12,619,"Ajax son of Oileus, never for a moment left the side of Ajax, son"
100,12,620,"of Telamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the"
100,12,621,"plough which they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat"
100,12,622,steams upwards from about the roots of their horns — nothing but
100,12,623,the yoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach
100,12,624,the end of the field — even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to
100,12,625,shoulder by one another. Many and brave comrades followed the son
100,12,626,"of Telamon, to relieve him of his shield when he was overcome"
100,12,627,"with sweat and toil, but the Locrians did not follow so close"
100,12,628,"after the son of Oileus, for they could not hold their own in a"
100,12,629,hand - to - hand fight. They had no bronze helmets with plumes of
100,12,630,"horse - hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears, but they"
100,12,631,"had come to Troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted wool"
100,12,632,from which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of the
100,12,633,"Trojans. The others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the"
100,12,634,"brunt of the fight with the Trojans and with Hector, while the"
100,12,635,"Locrians shot from behind, under their cover; and thus the"
100,12,636,"Trojans began to lose heart, for the arrows threw them into"
100,12,637,confusion.
100,12,638,The Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the
100,12,639,"ships and tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently"
100,12,640,"said to Hector, “Hector, there is no persuading you to take"
100,12,641,advice. Because heaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of
100,12,642,"war, you think that you must therefore excel others in counsel;"
100,12,643,but you cannot thus claim preeminence in all things. Heaven has
100,12,644,made one man an excellent soldier; of another it has made a
100,12,645,dancer or a singer and player on the lyre; while yet in another
100,12,646,Jove has implanted a wise understanding of which men reap fruit
100,12,647,"to the saving of many, and he himself knows more about it than"
100,12,648,any one; therefore I will say what I think will be best. The
100,12,649,"fight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now"
100,12,650,that the Trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in
100,12,651,"full armour, while others are fighting scattered and outnumbered"
100,12,652,"near the ships. Draw back, therefore, and call your chieftains"
100,12,653,"round you, that we may advise together whether to fall now upon"
100,12,654,"the ships in the hope that heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to"
100,12,655,beat a retreat while we can yet safely do so. I greatly fear that
100,12,656,"the Achaeans will pay us their debt of yesterday in full, for"
100,12,657,"there is one abiding at their ships who is never weary of battle,"
100,12,658,and who will not hold aloof much longer.”
100,12,659,"Thus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He"
100,12,660,"sprang in full armour from his chariot and said, “Polydamas,"
100,12,661,"gather the chieftains here; I will go yonder into the fight, but"
100,12,662,will return at once when I have given them their orders.”
100,12,663,"He then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a"
100,12,664,loud cry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies.
100,12,665,When they heard his voice they all hastened to gather round
100,12,666,"Polydamas, the excellent son of Panthous, but Hector kept on"
100,12,667,"among the foremost, looking everywhere to find Deiphobus and"
100,12,668,"prince Helenus, Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus;"
100,12,669,"living, indeed, and scatheless he could no longer find them, for"
100,12,670,"the two last were lying by the sterns of the Achaean ships, slain"
100,12,671,"by the Argives, while the others had been also stricken and"
100,12,672,wounded by them; but upon the left wing of the dread battle he
100,12,673,"found Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, cheering his men and"
100,12,674,urging them on to fight. He went up to him and upbraided him.
100,12,675,"“Paris,” said he, “evil - hearted Paris, fair to see but woman - mad"
100,12,676,"and false of tongue, where are Deiphobus and King Helenus? Where"
100,12,677,"are Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus? Where too is"
100,12,678,Othryoneus? Ilius is undone and will now surely fall!”
100,12,679,"Alexandrus answered, “Hector, why find fault when there is no one"
100,12,680,to find fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day
100,12,681,"rather than this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the"
100,12,682,coward about me. From the moment when you set our men fighting
100,12,683,about the ships we have been staying here and doing battle with
100,12,684,the Danaans. Our comrades about whom you ask me are dead;
100,12,685,"Deiphobus and King Helenus alone have left the field, wounded"
100,12,686,"both of them in the hand, but the son of Saturn saved them alive."
100,12,687,"Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us go, and we will"
100,12,688,follow with right goodwill; you shall not find us fail you in so
100,12,689,"far as our strength holds out, but no man can do more than in him"
100,12,690,"lies, no matter how willing he may be.”"
100,12,691,"With these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went"
100,12,692,"towards the part of the battle where the fight was thickest,"
100,12,693,"about Cebriones, brave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike"
100,12,694,"Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius, and Morys son of Hippotion, who had"
100,12,695,come from fertile Ascania on the preceding day to relieve other
100,12,696,troops. Then Jove urged them on to fight. They flew forth like
100,12,697,the blasts of some fierce wind that strike earth in the van of a
100,12,698,thunderstorm — they buffet the salt sea into an uproar; many and
100,12,699,mighty are the great waves that come crashing in one after the
100,12,700,other upon the shore with their arching heads all crested with
100,12,701,foam — even so did rank behind rank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming
100,12,702,armour follow their leaders onward. The way was led by Hector son
100,12,703,"of Priam, peer of murderous Mars, with his round shield before"
100,12,704,him — his shield of ox - hides covered with plates of bronze — and his
100,12,705,gleaming helmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward under
100,12,706,"cover of his shield in every direction, making trial of the ranks"
100,12,707,"to see if they would give way before him, but he could not daunt"
100,12,708,the courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first to stride out and
100,12,709,"challenge him. “Sir,” he cried, “draw near; why do you think thus"
100,12,710,"vainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellent soldiers,"
100,12,711,"but the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Your heart,"
100,12,712,"forsooth, is set on destroying our ships, but we too have hands"
100,12,713,"that can keep you at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner"
100,12,714,taken and sacked by ourselves. The time is near when you shall
100,12,715,"pray Jove and all the gods in your flight, that your steeds may"
100,12,716,be swifter than hawks as they raise the dust on the plain and
100,12,717,bear you back to your city.”
100,12,718,"As he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and"
100,12,719,"the host of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the"
100,12,720,"omen. But Hector answered, “Ajax, braggart and false of tongue,"
100,12,721,would that I were as sure of being son for evermore to
100,12,722,"aegis - bearing Jove, with Queen Juno for my mother, and of being"
100,12,723,"held in like honour with Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this"
100,12,724,day is big with the destruction of the Achaeans; and you shall
100,12,725,fall among them if you dare abide my spear; it shall rend your
100,12,726,fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds of prey with your
100,12,727,"fat and your flesh, as you fall by the ships of the Achaeans.”"
100,12,728,With these words he led the way and the others followed after
100,12,729,"with a cry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them."
100,12,730,"The Argives on their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they"
100,12,731,"forget their prowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the"
100,12,732,"Trojan chieftains, and the cry from both the hosts rose up to"
100,12,733,heaven and to the brightness of Jove’s presence.
100,13,1,"Agamemnon proposes that the Achaeans should sail home, and is"
100,13,2,rebuked by Ulysses — Juno beguiles Jupiter — Hector is wounded.
100,13,3,"Nestor was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not"
100,13,4,"escape him, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, “What, noble"
100,13,5,"Machaon, is the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting"
100,13,6,"by our ships grow stronger and stronger; stay here, therefore,"
100,13,7,"and sit over your wine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and"
100,13,8,washes the clotted blood from off you. I will go at once to the
100,13,9,look - out station and see what it is all about.”
100,13,10,As he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was
100,13,11,"lying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had"
100,13,12,taken his father’s shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze - shod
100,13,13,"spear, and as soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of"
100,13,14,"the Achaeans who, now that their wall was overthrown, were flying"
100,13,15,pell - mell before the Trojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon
100,13,16,"the sea, but the waves are dumb — they keep their eyes on the watch"
100,13,17,"for the quarter whence the fierce winds may spring upon them, but"
100,13,18,"they stay where they are and set neither this way nor that, till"
100,13,19,some particular wind sweeps down from heaven to determine
100,13,20,them — even so did the old man ponder whether to make for the crowd
100,13,21,"of Danaans, or go in search of Agamemnon. In the end he deemed it"
100,13,22,best to go to the son of Atreus; but meanwhile the hosts were
100,13,23,"fighting and killing one another, and the hard bronze rattled on"
100,13,24,"their bodies, as they thrust at one another with their swords and"
100,13,25,spears.
100,13,26,"The wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son"
100,13,27,"of Atreus, fell in with Nestor as they were coming up from their"
100,13,28,ships — for theirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting
100,13,29,"was going on, being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been"
100,13,30,"beached first, while the wall had been built behind the"
100,13,31,"hindermost. The stretch of the shore, wide though it was, did not"
100,13,32,"afford room for all the ships, and the host was cramped for"
100,13,33,"space, therefore they had placed the ships in rows one behind the"
100,13,34,"other, and had filled the whole opening of the bay between the"
100,13,35,"two points that formed it. The kings, leaning on their spears,"
100,13,36,"were coming out to survey the fight, being in great anxiety, and"
100,13,37,when old Nestor met them they were filled with dismay. Then King
100,13,38,"Agamemnon said to him, “Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the"
100,13,39,"Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I fear"
100,13,40,"that what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among"
100,13,41,the Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had
100,13,42,"fired our ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it"
100,13,43,"is all coming true. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles,"
100,13,44,are in such anger with me that they refuse to fight by the sterns
100,13,45,of our ships.”
100,13,46,"Then Nestor knight of Gerene, answered, “It is indeed as you say;"
100,13,47,"it is all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders"
100,13,48,from on high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we
100,13,49,relied as an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The
100,13,50,Trojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships;
100,13,51,look where you may you cannot see from what quarter the rout of
100,13,52,the Achaeans is coming; they are being killed in a confused mass
100,13,53,"and the battle - cry ascends to heaven; let us think, if counsel"
100,13,54,"can be of any use, what we had better do; but I do not advise our"
100,13,55,"going into battle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is"
100,13,56,wounded.”
100,13,57,"And King Agamemnon answered, “Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed"
100,13,58,"fighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the"
100,13,59,"trench has served us — over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and"
100,13,60,which they deemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and
100,13,61,our fleet — I see it must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans
100,13,62,"should perish ingloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove"
100,13,63,"was willing to defend us, and I know now that he is raising the"
100,13,64,"Trojans to like honour with the gods, while us, on the other"
100,13,65,"hand, he has bound hand and foot. Now, therefore, let us all do"
100,13,66,as I say; let us bring down the ships that are on the beach and
100,13,67,draw them into the water; let us make them fast to their
100,13,68,"mooring - stones a little way out, against the fall of night — if"
100,13,69,even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may then
100,13,70,draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in flying
100,13,71,ruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly and
100,13,72,be saved than be caught and killed.”
100,13,73,"Ulysses looked fiercely at him and said, “Son of Atreus, what are"
100,13,74,"you talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other"
100,13,75,"and baser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has"
100,13,76,"allotted a life of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we"
100,13,77,every one of us perish. Is it thus that you would quit the city
100,13,78,"of Troy, to win which we have suffered so much hardship? Hold"
100,13,79,"your peace, lest some other of the Achaeans hear you say what no"
100,13,80,"man who knows how to give good counsel, no king over so great a"
100,13,81,host as that of the Argives should ever have let fall from his
100,13,82,lips. I despise your judgement utterly for what you have been
100,13,83,"saying. Would you, then, have us draw down our ships into the"
100,13,84,"water while the battle is raging, and thus play further into the"
100,13,85,hands of the conquering Trojans? It would be ruin; the Achaeans
100,13,86,will not go on fighting when they see the ships being drawn into
100,13,87,"the water, but will cease attacking and keep turning their eyes"
100,13,88,"towards them; your counsel, therefore, sir captain, would be our"
100,13,89,destruction.”
100,13,90,"Agamemnon answered, “Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the"
100,13,91,"heart. I am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their"
100,13,92,"ships into the sea whether they will or no. Someone, it may be,"
100,13,93,"old or young, can offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice"
100,13,94,to hear.”
100,13,95,"Then said Diomed, “Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek,"
100,13,96,if you will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am
100,13,97,"younger than any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire,"
100,13,98,"Tydeus, who lies buried at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble"
100,13,99,"sons, two of whom, Agrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky"
100,13,100,"Calydon. The third was the knight Oeneus, my father’s father, and"
100,13,101,he was the most valiant of them all. Oeneus remained in his own
100,13,102,"country, but my father (as Jove and the other gods ordained it)"
100,13,103,"migrated to Argos. He married into the family of Adrastus, and"
100,13,104,"his house was one of great abundance, for he had large estates of"
100,13,105,"rich corn - growing land, with much orchard ground as well, and he"
100,13,106,had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the Argives in the use
100,13,107,of the spear. You must yourselves have heard whether these things
100,13,108,are true or no; therefore when I say well despise not my words as
100,13,109,"though I were a coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then, let us"
100,13,110,"go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though we be. When"
100,13,111,"there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the range of the"
100,13,112,spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we have
100,13,113,"already, but we can spur on others, who have been indulging their"
100,13,114,spleen and holding aloof from battle hitherto.”
100,13,115,Thus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set
100,13,116,"out, King Agamemnon leading the way."
100,13,117,"Meanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look - out, and came up to them"
100,13,118,in the semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon’s right hand in
100,13,119,"his own and said, “Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now"
100,13,120,"that he sees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly"
100,13,121,without remorse — may he come to a bad end and heaven confound him.
100,13,122,"As for yourself, the blessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry"
100,13,123,with you but that the princes and counsellors of the Trojans
100,13,124,"shall again raise the dust upon the plain, and you shall see them"
100,13,125,flying from the ships and tents towards their city.”
100,13,126,"With this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to"
100,13,127,the plain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of
100,13,128,nine or ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a
100,13,129,"fight, and it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans"
100,13,130,to wage war and do battle without ceasing.
100,13,131,Juno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of
100,13,132,Olympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was
100,13,133,"at once her brother and her brother - in - law, hurrying hither and"
100,13,134,thither amid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he
100,13,135,"sat on the topmost crests of many - fountained Ida, and loathed"
100,13,136,"him. She set herself to think how she might hoodwink him, and in"
100,13,137,the end she deemed that it would be best for her to go to Ida and
100,13,138,"array herself in rich attire, in the hope that Jove might become"
100,13,139,"enamoured of her, and wish to embrace her. While he was thus"
100,13,140,engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made to steal over
100,13,141,his eyes and senses.
100,13,142,"She went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made"
100,13,143,"her, and the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of"
100,13,144,a secret key so that no other god could open them. Here she
100,13,145,entered and closed the doors behind her. She cleansed all the
100,13,146,"dirt from her fair body with ambrosia, then she anointed herself"
100,13,147,"with olive oil, ambrosial, very soft, and scented specially for"
100,13,148,herself — if it were so much as shaken in the bronze - floored house
100,13,149,"of Jove, the scent pervaded the universe of heaven and earth."
100,13,150,"With this she anointed her delicate skin, and then she plaited"
100,13,151,the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in a stream of golden
100,13,152,tresses from her immortal head. She put on the wondrous robe
100,13,153,"which Minerva had worked for her with consummate art, and had"
100,13,154,embroidered with manifold devices; she fastened it about her
100,13,155,"bosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself with a girdle"
100,13,156,"that had a hundred tassels: then she fastened her earrings, three"
100,13,157,"brilliant pendants that glistened most beautifully, through the"
100,13,158,"pierced lobes of her ears, and threw a lovely new veil over her"
100,13,159,"head. She bound her sandals on to her feet, and when she had"
100,13,160,"arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction, she left her room"
100,13,161,"and called Venus to come aside and speak to her. “My dear child,”"
100,13,162,"said she, “will you do what I am going to ask of you, or will you"
100,13,163,"refuse me because you are angry at my being on the Danaan side,"
100,13,164,while you are on the Trojan?”
100,13,165,"Jove’s daughter Venus answered, “Juno, august queen of goddesses,"
100,13,166,"daughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it"
100,13,167,"for you at once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.”"
100,13,168,"Then Juno told her a lying tale and said, “I want you to endow me"
100,13,169,"with some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring"
100,13,170,all things mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the
100,13,171,world’s end to visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and
100,13,172,"mother Tethys: they received me in their house, took care of me,"
100,13,173,"and brought me up, having taken me over from Rhaea when Jove"
100,13,174,imprisoned great Saturn in the depths that are under earth and
100,13,175,sea. I must go and see them that I may make peace between them;
100,13,176,"they have been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not"
100,13,177,slept with one another this long while; if I can bring them round
100,13,178,"and restore them to one another’s embraces, they will be grateful"
100,13,179,to me and love me for ever afterwards.”
100,13,180,"Thereon laughter - loving Venus said, “I cannot and must not refuse"
100,13,181,"you, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king.”"
100,13,182,As she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered
100,13,183,"girdle into which all her charms had been wrought — love, desire,"
100,13,184,and that sweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the
100,13,185,"most prudent. She gave the girdle to Juno and said, “Take this"
100,13,186,girdle wherein all my charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If
100,13,187,"you will wear it I promise you that your errand, be it what it"
100,13,188,"may, will not be bootless.”"
100,13,189,"When she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the"
100,13,190,girdle in her bosom.
100,13,191,"Venus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted"
100,13,192,down from the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair
100,13,193,"Emathia, and went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of"
100,13,194,"the Thracian horsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without"
100,13,195,ever setting foot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on
100,13,196,"over the waves of the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of"
100,13,197,"noble Thoas. There she met Sleep, own brother to Death, and"
100,13,198,"caught him by the hand, saying, “Sleep, you who lord it alike"
100,13,199,"over mortals and immortals, if you ever did me a service in times"
100,13,200,"past, do one for me now, and I shall be grateful to you ever"
100,13,201,after. Close Jove’s keen eyes for me in slumber while I hold him
100,13,202,"clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful golden"
100,13,203,"seat, that can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son Vulcan"
100,13,204,"shall make it for you, and he shall give it a footstool for you"
100,13,205,to rest your fair feet upon when you are at table.”
100,13,206,"Then Sleep answered, “Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of"
100,13,207,"mighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep"
100,13,208,"without compunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus"
100,13,209,"from whom all of them proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor"
100,13,210,send him to sleep unless he bids me. I have had one lesson
100,13,211,"already through doing what you asked me, on the day when Jove’s"
100,13,212,mighty son Hercules set sail from Ilius after having sacked the
100,13,213,city of the Trojans. At your bidding I suffused my sweet self
100,13,214,"over the mind of aegis - bearing Jove, and laid him to rest;"
100,13,215,"meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and set the blasts"
100,13,216,"of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took him to the"
100,13,217,"goodly city of Cos, away from all his friends. Jove was furious"
100,13,218,"when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the"
100,13,219,"house; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would"
100,13,220,have flung me down through space into the sea where I should
100,13,221,"never have been heard of any more, had not Night who cows both"
100,13,222,men and gods protected me. I fled to her and Jove left off
100,13,223,"looking for me in spite of his being so angry, for he did not"
100,13,224,dare do anything to displease Night. And now you are again asking
100,13,225,me to do something on which I cannot venture.”
100,13,226,"And Juno said, “Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into"
100,13,227,your head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the
100,13,228,"Trojans, as he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to"
100,13,229,"one of the youngest of the Graces, and she shall be your"
100,13,230,"own — Pasithea, whom you have always wanted to marry.”"
100,13,231,"Sleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, “Then swear"
100,13,232,it to me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on
100,13,233,"the bounteous earth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so"
100,13,234,that all the gods who dwell down below with Saturn may be our
100,13,235,"witnesses, and see that you really do give me one of the youngest"
100,13,236,"of the Graces — Pasithea, whom I have always wanted to marry.”"
100,13,237,"Juno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of"
100,13,238,"the nether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had"
100,13,239,"completed her oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist"
100,13,240,"and sped lightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them."
100,13,241,"Presently they reached many - fountained Ida, mother of wild"
100,13,242,"beasts, and Lectum where they left the sea to go on by land, and"
100,13,243,the tops of the trees of the forest soughed under the going of
100,13,244,"their feet. Here Sleep halted, and ere Jove caught sight of him"
100,13,245,he climbed a lofty pine - tree — the tallest that reared its head
100,13,246,towards heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind the branches and
100,13,247,sat there in the semblance of the sweet - singing bird that haunts
100,13,248,"the mountains and is called Chalcis by the gods, but men call it"
100,13,249,"Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the topmost peak of Ida,"
100,13,250,"and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as he"
100,13,251,did so he became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her
100,13,252,that he had felt when they had first enjoyed each other’s
100,13,253,"embraces, and slept with one another without their dear parents"
100,13,254,"knowing anything about it. He went up to her and said, “What do"
100,13,255,you want that you have come hither from Olympus — and that too with
100,13,256,neither chariot nor horses to convey you?”
100,13,257,"Then Juno told him a lying tale and said, “I am going to the"
100,13,258,"world’s end, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and"
100,13,259,"mother Tethys; they received me into their house, took care of"
100,13,260,"me, and brought me up. I must go and see them that I may make"
100,13,261,"peace between them: they have been quarrelling, and are so angry"
100,13,262,that they have not slept with one another this long time. The
100,13,263,horses that will take me over land and sea are stationed on the
100,13,264,"lowermost spurs of many - fountained Ida, and I have come here from"
100,13,265,Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was afraid you might be
100,13,266,"angry with me later on, if I went to the house of Oceanus without"
100,13,267,letting you know.”
100,13,268,"And Jove said, “Juno, you can choose some other time for paying"
100,13,269,your visit to Oceanus — for the present let us devote ourselves to
100,13,270,love and to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been
100,13,271,so overpowered by passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as
100,13,272,I am at this moment for yourself — not even when I was in love with
100,13,273,"the wife of Ixion who bore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel,"
100,13,274,"nor yet with Danae the daintily - ancled daughter of Acrisius, who"
100,13,275,bore me the famed hero Perseus. Then there was the daughter of
100,13,276,"Phoenix, who bore me Minos and Rhadamanthus: there was Semele,"
100,13,277,and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot my lion - hearted son
100,13,278,"Hercules, while Semele became mother to Bacchus the comforter of"
100,13,279,"mankind. There was queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and"
100,13,280,yourself — but with none of these was I ever so much enamoured as I
100,13,281,now am with you.”
100,13,282,Juno again answered him with a lying tale. “Most dread son of
100,13,283,"Saturn,” she exclaimed, “what are you talking about? Would you"
100,13,284,"have us enjoy one another here on the top of Mount Ida, where"
100,13,285,everything can be seen? What if one of the ever - living gods
100,13,286,"should see us sleeping together, and tell the others? It would be"
100,13,287,such a scandal that when I had risen from your embraces I could
100,13,288,never show myself inside your house again; but if you are so
100,13,289,"minded, there is a room which your son Vulcan has made me, and he"
100,13,290,"has given it good strong doors; if you would so have it, let us"
100,13,291,go thither and lie down.”
100,13,292,"And Jove answered, “Juno, you need not be afraid that either god"
100,13,293,"or man will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a"
100,13,294,"dense golden cloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing"
100,13,295,beams shall not see through it.”
100,13,296,With this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace;
100,13,297,"whereon the earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with"
100,13,298,"dew - bespangled lotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick"
100,13,299,that it raised them well above the ground. Here they laid
100,13,300,themselves down and overhead they were covered by a fair cloud of
100,13,301,"gold, from which there fell glittering dew - drops."
100,13,302,"Thus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the"
100,13,303,"crest of Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his"
100,13,304,spouse in his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the
100,13,305,"Achaeans, to tell earth - encircling Neptune, lord of the"
100,13,306,"earthquake. When he had found him he said, “Now, Neptune, you can"
100,13,307,"help the Danaans with a will, and give them victory though it be"
100,13,308,only for a short time while Jove is still sleeping. I have sent
100,13,309,"him into a sweet slumber, and Juno has beguiled him into going to"
100,13,310,bed with her.”
100,13,311,"Sleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind,"
100,13,312,leaving Neptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He
100,13,313,"darted forward among the first ranks and shouted saying,"
100,13,314,"“Argives, shall we let Hector son of Priam have the triumph of"
100,13,315,taking our ships and covering himself with glory? This is what he
100,13,316,"says that he shall now do, seeing that Achilles is still in"
100,13,317,dudgeon at his ship; we shall get on very well without him if we
100,13,318,"keep each other in heart and stand by one another. Now,"
100,13,319,"therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best and"
100,13,320,"largest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally"
100,13,321,"forth with our longest spears in our hands; I will lead you on,"
100,13,322,"and Hector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold"
100,13,323,out against us. If any good staunch soldier has only a small
100,13,324,"shield, let him hand it over to a worse man, and take a larger"
100,13,325,one for himself.”
100,13,326,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of"
100,13,327,"Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the"
100,13,328,"others in array, and went about everywhere effecting the"
100,13,329,"exchanges of armour; the most valiant took the best armour, and"
100,13,330,gave the worse to the worse man. When they had donned their
100,13,331,bronze armour they marched on with Neptune at their head. In his
100,13,332,"strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keen of edge and"
100,13,333,flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes across it in the
100,13,334,day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away from it.
100,13,335,Hector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon
100,13,336,Neptune and Hector waged fierce war on one another — Hector on the
100,13,337,Trojan and Neptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as
100,13,338,the two forces met; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and
100,13,339,"tents of the Achaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more"
100,13,340,"loudly when driven before the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames"
100,13,341,of a forest fire roar more fiercely when it is well alight upon
100,13,342,"the mountains, nor does the wind bellow with ruder music as it"
100,13,343,"tears on through the tops of when it is blowing its hardest, than"
100,13,344,the terrible shout which the Trojans and Achaeans raised as they
100,13,345,sprang upon one another.
100,13,346,"Hector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards"
100,13,347,"him, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two"
100,13,348,bands passed over his chest — the band of his shield and that of
100,13,349,his silver - studded sword — and these protected his body. Hector was
100,13,350,"angry that his spear should have been hurled in vain, and"
100,13,351,"withdrew under cover of his men. As he was thus retreating, Ajax"
100,13,352,"son of Telamon, struck him with a stone, of which there were many"
100,13,353,lying about under the men’s feet as they fought — brought there to
100,13,354,give support to the ships’ sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax
100,13,355,caught up one of them and struck Hector above the rim of his
100,13,356,shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin round like a top
100,13,357,and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when
100,13,358,"uprooted by the lightning flash of father Jove, and there is a"
100,13,359,terrible smell of brimstone — no man can help being dismayed if he
100,13,360,"is standing near it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing — even"
100,13,361,so did Hector fall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell
100,13,362,"from his hand, but his shield and helmet were made fast about his"
100,13,363,"body, and his bronze armour rang about him."
100,13,364,The sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards
100,13,365,"him, hoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on"
100,13,366,"the Trojans, but none of them could wound him before he was"
100,13,367,"surrounded and covered by the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor,"
100,13,368,"Sarpedon captain of the Lycians, and noble Glaucus. Of the"
100,13,369,"others, too, there was not one who was unmindful of him, and they"
100,13,370,held their round shields over him to cover him. His comrades then
100,13,371,lifted him off the ground and bore him away from the battle to
100,13,372,the place where his horses stood waiting for him at the rear of
100,13,373,the fight with their driver and the chariot; these then took him
100,13,374,towards the city groaning and in great pain. When they reached
100,13,375,"the ford of the fair stream of Xanthus, begotten of Immortal"
100,13,376,"Jove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on the"
100,13,377,"ground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he"
100,13,378,breathed again and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he
100,13,379,"vomited blood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes"
100,13,380,were again closed in darkness for he was still stunned by the
100,13,381,blow.
100,13,382,"When the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart"
100,13,383,and set upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of
100,13,384,"Oileus began by springing on Satnius son of Enops, and wounding"
100,13,385,him with his spear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as
100,13,386,he was herding cattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The
100,13,387,son of Oileus came up to him and struck him in the flank so that
100,13,388,"he fell, and a fierce fight between Trojans and Danaans raged"
100,13,389,round his body. Polydamas son of Panthous drew near to avenge
100,13,390,"him, and wounded Prothoenor son of Areilycus on the right"
100,13,391,"shoulder; the terrible spear went right through his shoulder, and"
100,13,392,he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust. Polydamas vaunted
100,13,393,"loudly over him saying, “Again I take it that the spear has not"
100,13,394,sped in vain from the strong hand of the son of Panthous; an
100,13,395,"Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve him for a"
100,13,396,staff as he goes down into the house of Hades.”
100,13,397,The Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon
100,13,398,"was more angry than any, for the man had fallen close beside him;"
100,13,399,"so he aimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas"
100,13,400,saved himself by swerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus
100,13,401,"son of Antenor, for heaven counselled his destruction; it struck"
100,13,402,him where the head springs from the neck at the top joint of the
100,13,403,"spine, and severed both the tendons at the back of the head. His"
100,13,404,"head, mouth, and nostrils reached the ground long before his legs"
100,13,405,"and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying,"
100,13,406,"“Think, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether this man is not as"
100,13,407,"well worth killing as Prothoenor was: he seems rich, and of rich"
100,13,408,"family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight Antenor, for"
100,13,409,he is very like him.”
100,13,410,"But he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly"
100,13,411,angered. Acamas then bestrode his brother’s body and wounded
100,13,412,"Promachus the Boeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag"
100,13,413,"his brother’s body away. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying,"
100,13,414,"“Argive archers, braggarts that you are, toil and suffering shall"
100,13,415,"not be for us only, but some of you too shall fall here as well"
100,13,416,"as ourselves. See how Promachus now sleeps, vanquished by my"
100,13,417,spear; payment for my brother’s blood has not been long delayed;
100,13,418,"a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he leaves a kinsman in"
100,13,419,his house behind him to avenge his fall.”
100,13,420,"His taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged"
100,13,421,"than any of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not"
100,13,422,"stand his ground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich"
100,13,423,"flock - master Phorbas, whom Mercury had favoured and endowed with"
100,13,424,greater wealth than any other of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his
100,13,425,"only son, and Peneleos now wounded him in the eye under his"
100,13,426,"eyebrows, tearing the eye - ball from its socket: the spear went"
100,13,427,"right through the eye into the nape of the neck, and he fell,"
100,13,428,stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos then drew his
100,13,429,"sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and helmet"
100,13,430,came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in
100,13,431,"the eye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a"
100,13,432,"poppy - head, and showed it to the Trojans, vaunting over them as"
100,13,433,"he did so. “Trojans,” he cried, “bid the father and mother of"
100,13,434,"noble Ilioneus make moan for him in their house, for the wife"
100,13,435,also of Promachus son of Alegenor will never be gladdened by the
100,13,436,coming of her dear husband — when we Argives return with our ships
100,13,437,from Troy.”
100,13,438,"As he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about"
100,13,439,to see whither he might fly for safety.
100,13,440,"Tell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of"
100,13,441,the Argives to bear away blood - stained spoils after Neptune lord
100,13,442,of the earthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of
100,13,443,"Telamon was first to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the"
100,13,444,"staunch Mysians. Antilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while"
100,13,445,"Meriones slew Morys and Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon"
100,13,446,and Periphetes. The son of Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd
100,13,447,"of his people, in the flank, and the bronze point made his"
100,13,448,entrails gush out as it tore in among them; on this his life came
100,13,449,"hurrying out of him at the place where he had been wounded, and"
100,13,450,his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son of Oileus killed more
100,13,451,"than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he to pursue"
100,13,452,flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.
100,14,1,"Jove awakes, tells Apollo to heal Hector, and the Trojans again"
100,14,2,become victorious.
100,14,3,But when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set
100,14,4,"stakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the"
100,14,5,"Trojans made a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale"
100,14,6,"with fear. Jove now woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying"
100,14,7,"with golden - throned Juno by his side, and starting to his feet he"
100,14,8,"saw the Trojans and Achaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and"
100,14,9,the others driving them pell - mell before them with King Neptune
100,14,10,in their midst. He saw Hector lying on the ground with his
100,14,11,"comrades gathered round him, gasping for breath, wandering in"
100,14,12,"mind and vomiting blood, for it was not the feeblest of the"
100,14,13,Achaeans who struck him.
100,14,14,"The sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on"
100,14,15,"Juno. “I see, Juno,” said he, “you mischief - making trickster,"
100,14,16,that your cunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused
100,14,17,"the rout of his host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which"
100,14,18,case you will be the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy
100,14,19,knavery. Do you not remember how once upon a time I had you
100,14,20,"hanged? I fastened two anvils on to your feet, and bound your"
100,14,21,"hands in a chain of gold which none might break, and you hung in"
100,14,22,"mid - air among the clouds. All the gods in Olympus were in a fury,"
100,14,23,but they could not reach you to set you free; when I caught any
100,14,24,one of them I gripped him and hurled him from the heavenly
100,14,25,threshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even this did
100,14,26,not relieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which I felt about
100,14,27,noble Hercules whom you and Boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond
100,14,28,"the seas to Cos, after suborning the tempests; but I rescued him,"
100,14,29,and notwithstanding all his mighty labours I brought him back
100,14,30,again to Argos. I would remind you of this that you may learn to
100,14,31,"leave off being so deceitful, and discover how much you are"
100,14,32,likely to gain by the embraces out of which you have come here to
100,14,33,trick me.”
100,14,34,"Juno trembled as he spoke, and said, “May heaven above and earth"
100,14,35,"below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx — and this"
100,14,36,"is the most solemn oath that a blessed god can take — nay, I swear"
100,14,37,also by your own almighty head and by our bridal bed — things over
100,14,38,which I could never possibly perjure myself — that Neptune is not
100,14,39,punishing Hector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through
100,14,40,any doing of mine; it is all of his own mere motion because he
100,14,41,was sorry to see the Achaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I
100,14,42,"were advising him, I should tell him to do as you bid him.”"
100,14,43,"The sire of gods and men smiled and answered, “If you, Juno, were"
100,14,44,"always to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune,"
100,14,45,"like it or no, would soon come round to your and my way of"
100,14,46,"thinking. If, then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you"
100,14,47,"say, go among the rank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and"
100,14,48,"Apollo lord of the bow, that I want them — Iris, that she may go to"
100,14,49,the Achaean host and tell Neptune to leave off fighting and go
100,14,50,"home, and Apollo, that he may send Hector again into battle and"
100,14,51,give him fresh strength; he will thus forget his present
100,14,52,"sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back in confusion till they"
100,14,53,fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus. Achilles will
100,14,54,"then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and Hector will kill"
100,14,55,"him in front of Ilius after he has slain many warriors, and among"
100,14,56,them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill Hector to
100,14,57,"avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it about that"
100,14,58,the Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back till they
100,14,59,fulfil the counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will not
100,14,60,"stay my anger, nor permit any god to help the Danaans till I have"
100,14,61,"accomplished the desire of the son of Peleus, according to the"
100,14,62,promise I made by bowing my head on the day when Thetis touched
100,14,63,my knees and besought me to give him honour.”
100,14,64,Juno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great
100,14,65,Olympus. Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over
100,14,66,"vast continents, and he says to himself, “Now I will be here, or"
100,14,67,"there,” and he would have all manner of things — even so swiftly"
100,14,68,did Juno wing her way till she came to high Olympus and went in
100,14,69,among the gods who were gathered in the house of Jove. When they
100,14,70,"saw her they all of them came up to her, and held out their cups"
100,14,71,"to her by way of greeting. She let the others be, but took the"
100,14,72,"cup offered her by lovely Themis, who was first to come running"
100,14,73,"up to her. “Juno,” said she, “why are you here? And you seem"
100,14,74,troubled — has your husband the son of Saturn been frightening
100,14,75,you?”
100,14,76,"And Juno answered, “Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what"
100,14,77,a proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to
100,14,78,"table, where you and all the immortals can hear the wicked"
100,14,79,"designs which he has avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal,"
100,14,80,"will be angered by them, however peaceably he may be feasting"
100,14,81,now.”
100,14,82,"On this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the"
100,14,83,house of Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed
100,14,84,"with care, and she spoke up in a rage. “Fools that we are,” she"
100,14,85,"cried, “to be thus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to"
100,14,86,"go up to him and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits"
100,14,87,"aloof and cares for nobody, for he knows that he is much stronger"
100,14,88,"than any other of the immortals. Make the best, therefore, of"
100,14,89,"whatever ills he may choose to send each one of you; Mars, I take"
100,14,90,"it, has had a taste of them already, for his son Ascalaphus has"
100,14,91,fallen in battle — the man whom of all others he loved most dearly
100,14,92,and whose father he owns himself to be.”
100,14,93,When he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat
100,14,94,"of his hands, and said in anger, “Do not blame me, you gods that"
100,14,95,"dwell in heaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge"
100,14,96,"the death of my son, even though it end in my being struck by"
100,14,97,Jove’s lightning and lying in blood and dust among the corpses.”
100,14,98,"As he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout,"
100,14,99,"while he put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused"
100,14,100,to still more fierce and implacable enmity against the other
100,14,101,"immortals, had not Minerva, alarmed for the safety of the gods,"
100,14,102,sprung from her seat and hurried outside. She tore the helmet
100,14,103,"from his head and the shield from his shoulders, and she took the"
100,14,104,bronze spear from his strong hand and set it on one side; then
100,14,105,"she said to Mars, “Madman, you are undone; you have ears that"
100,14,106,"hear not, or you have lost all judgement and understanding; have"
100,14,107,you not heard what Juno has said on coming straight from the
100,14,108,presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish to go through all kinds of
100,14,109,"suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to Olympus,"
100,14,110,after having caused infinite mischief to all us others? Jove
100,14,111,would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves; he
100,14,112,"would come to Olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one"
100,14,113,"after another, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay aside your"
100,14,114,anger for the death of your son; better men than he have either
100,14,115,"been killed already or will fall hereafter, and one cannot"
100,14,116,protect every one’s whole family.”
100,14,117,With these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno
100,14,118,"called Apollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods."
100,14,119,"“Jove,” she said to them, “desires you to go to him at once on"
100,14,120,Mt. Ida; when you have seen him you are to do as he may then bid
100,14,121,you.”
100,14,122,"Thereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris"
100,14,123,and Apollo made all haste on their way. When they reached
100,14,124,"many - fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove"
100,14,125,seated on topmost Gargarus with a fragrant cloud encircling his
100,14,126,"head as with a diadem. They stood before his presence, and he was"
100,14,127,pleased with them for having been so quick in obeying the orders
100,14,128,his wife had given them.
100,14,129,"He spoke to Iris first. “Go,” said he, “fleet Iris, tell King"
100,14,130,Neptune what I now bid you — and tell him true. Bid him leave off
100,14,131,"fighting, and either join the company of the gods, or go down"
100,14,132,"into the sea. If he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him"
100,14,133,consider well whether he is strong enough to hold his own against
100,14,134,me if I attack him. I am older and much stronger than he is; yet
100,14,135,"he is not afraid to set himself up as on a level with myself, of"
100,14,136,whom all the other gods stand in awe.”
100,14,137,"Iris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or"
100,14,138,snowflakes that fly from out the clouds before the blast of
100,14,139,"Boreas, even so did she wing her way till she came close up to"
100,14,140,"the great shaker of the earth. Then she said, “I have come, O"
100,14,141,"dark - haired king that holds the world in his embrace, to bring"
100,14,142,"you a message from Jove. He bids you leave off fighting, and"
100,14,143,"either join the company of the gods or go down into the sea; if,"
100,14,144,"however, you take no heed and disobey him, he says he will come"
100,14,145,"down here and fight you. He would have you keep out of his reach,"
100,14,146,"for he is older and much stronger than you are, and yet you are"
100,14,147,"not afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself, of whom"
100,14,148,all the other gods stand in awe.”
100,14,149,"Neptune was very angry and said, “Great heavens! strong as Jove"
100,14,150,"may be, he has said more than he can do if he has threatened"
100,14,151,"violence against me, who am of like honour with himself. We were"
100,14,152,"three brothers whom Rhea bore to Saturn — Jove, myself, and Hades"
100,14,153,who rules the world below. Heaven and earth were divided into
100,14,154,"three parts, and each of us was to have an equal share. When we"
100,14,155,"cast lots, it fell to me to have my dwelling in the sea for"
100,14,156,"evermore; Hades took the darkness of the realms under the earth,"
100,14,157,while air and sky and clouds were the portion that fell to Jove;
100,14,158,but earth and great Olympus are the common property of all.
100,14,159,Therefore I will not walk as Jove would have me. For all his
100,14,160,"strength, let him keep to his own third share and be contented"
100,14,161,without threatening to lay hands upon me as though I were nobody.
100,14,162,"Let him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters,"
100,14,163,who must perforce obey him.”
100,14,164,"Iris fleet as the wind then answered, “Am I really, Neptune, to"
100,14,165,"take this daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you"
100,14,166,"reconsider your answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and"
100,14,167,you know that the Erinyes always range themselves on the side of
100,14,168,the older person.”
100,14,169,"Neptune answered, “Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in"
100,14,170,season. It is well when a messenger shows so much discretion.
100,14,171,Nevertheless it cuts me to the very heart that any one should
100,14,172,"rebuke so angrily another who is his own peer, and of like empire"
100,14,173,"with himself. Now, however, I will give way in spite of my"
100,14,174,"displeasure; furthermore let me tell you, and I mean what I"
100,14,175,"say — if contrary to the desire of myself, Minerva driver of the"
100,14,176,"spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King Vulcan, Jove spares steep Ilius,"
100,14,177,and will not let the Achaeans have the great triumph of sacking
100,14,178,"it, let him understand that he will incur our implacable"
100,14,179,resentment.”
100,14,180,"Neptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely"
100,14,181,"did the Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, “Go, dear"
100,14,182,"Phoebus, to Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his"
100,14,183,embrace has now gone down under the sea to avoid the severity of
100,14,184,my displeasure. Had he not done so those gods who are below with
100,14,185,Saturn would have come to hear of the fight between us. It is
100,14,186,better for both of us that he should have curbed his anger and
100,14,187,"kept out of my reach, for I should have had much trouble with"
100,14,188,"him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis, and shake it furiously, so"
100,14,189,"as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic; take, moreover, brave"
100,14,190,"Hector, O Far - Darter, into your own care, and rouse him to deeds"
100,14,191,"of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back to their ships"
100,14,192,"and to the Hellespont. From that point I will think it well over,"
100,14,193,how the Achaeans may have a respite from their troubles.”
100,14,194,"Apollo obeyed his father’s saying, and left the crests of Ida,"
100,14,195,"flying like a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He"
100,14,196,"found Hector no longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for"
100,14,197,he had just come to himself again. He knew those who were about
100,14,198,"him, and the sweat and hard breathing had left him from the"
100,14,199,moment when the will of aegis - bearing Jove had revived him.
100,14,200,"Apollo stood beside him and said, “Hector son of Priam, why are"
100,14,201,"you so faint, and why are you here away from the others? Has any"
100,14,202,mishap befallen you?”
100,14,203,"Hector in a weak voice answered, “And which, kind sir, of the"
100,14,204,"gods are you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax"
100,14,205,struck me on the chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades
100,14,206,"at the ships of the Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off"
100,14,207,fighting? I made sure that this very day I should breathe my last
100,14,208,and go down into the house of Hades.”
100,14,209,"Then King Apollo said to him, “Take heart; the son of Saturn has"
100,14,210,"sent you a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you,"
100,14,211,"even me, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been"
100,14,212,"guardian hitherto not only of yourself but of your city. Now,"
100,14,213,"therefore, order your horsemen to drive their chariots to the"
100,14,214,ships in great multitudes. I will go before your horses to smooth
100,14,215,"the way for them, and will turn the Achaeans in flight.”"
100,14,216,As he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his
100,14,217,"people. And as a horse, stabled and full - fed, breaks loose and"
100,14,218,gallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont
100,14,219,"to take his bath in the river — he tosses his head, and his mane"
100,14,220,streams over his shoulders as in all the pride of his strength he
100,14,221,flies full speed to the pastures where the mares are feeding — even
100,14,222,"so Hector, when he heard what the god said, urged his horsemen"
100,14,223,"on, and sped forward as fast as his limbs could take him. As"
100,14,224,country peasants set their hounds on to a homed stag or wild
100,14,225,"goat — he has taken shelter under rock or thicket, and they cannot"
100,14,226,"find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shouts have roused"
100,14,227,"stands in their path, and they are in no further humour for the"
100,14,228,"chase — even so the Achaeans were still charging on in a body,"
100,14,229,"using their swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they"
100,14,230,"saw Hector going about among his men they were afraid, and their"
100,14,231,hearts fell down into their feet.
100,14,232,"Then spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man"
100,14,233,"who could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close"
100,14,234,"fight, while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were"
100,14,235,divided. He then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them
100,14,236,"thus: “What, in heaven’s name, do I now see? Is it not Hector"
100,14,237,come to life again? Every one made sure he had been killed by
100,14,238,"Ajax son of Telamon, but it seems that one of the gods has again"
100,14,239,"rescued him. He has killed many of us Danaans already, and I take"
100,14,240,"it will yet do so, for the hand of Jove must be with him or he"
100,14,241,would never dare show himself so masterful in the forefront of
100,14,242,"the battle. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us order"
100,14,243,"the main body of our forces to fall back upon the ships, but let"
100,14,244,"those of us who profess to be the flower of the army stand firm,"
100,14,245,and see whether we cannot hold Hector back at the point of our
100,14,246,spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive that he will then
100,14,247,think better of it before he tries to charge into the press of
100,14,248,the Danaans.”
100,14,249,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who"
100,14,250,"were about Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of"
100,14,251,"Teucer, Meriones, and Meges peer of Mars called all their best"
100,14,252,men about them and sustained the fight against Hector and the
100,14,253,"Trojans, but the main body fell back upon the ships of the"
100,14,254,Achaeans.
100,14,255,"The Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding"
100,14,256,on at their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in
100,14,257,cloud about his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with
100,14,258,"its shaggy fringe, which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to"
100,14,259,strike terror into the hearts of men. With this in his hand he
100,14,260,led on the Trojans.
100,14,261,The Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of
100,14,262,"battle rose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the"
100,14,263,bowstrings. Many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in
100,14,264,"the bodies of many a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth"
100,14,265,"midway, before they could taste of man’s fair flesh and glut"
100,14,266,themselves with blood. So long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis
100,14,267,"quietly and without shaking it, the weapons on either side took"
100,14,268,"effect and the people fell, but when he shook it straight in the"
100,14,269,face of the Danaans and raised his mighty battle - cry their hearts
100,14,270,fainted within them and they forgot their former prowess. As when
100,14,271,two wild beasts spring in the dead of night on a herd of cattle
100,14,272,or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman is not there — even so
100,14,273,"were the Danaans struck helpless, for Apollo filled them with"
100,14,274,panic and gave victory to Hector and the Trojans.
100,14,275,The fight then became more scattered and they killed one another
100,14,276,"where they best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the"
100,14,277,"one, leader of the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade"
100,14,278,of Menestheus. Aeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was
100,14,279,"bastard son to Oileus, and brother to Ajax, but he lived in"
100,14,280,"Phylace away from his own country, for he had killed a man, a"
100,14,281,kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom Oileus had married. Iasus
100,14,282,"had become a leader of the Athenians, and was son of Sphelus the"
100,14,283,"son of Boucolos. Polydamas killed Mecisteus, and Polites Echius,"
100,14,284,"in the front of the battle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris"
100,14,285,"struck Deiochus from behind in the lower part of the shoulder, as"
100,14,286,"he was flying among the foremost, and the point of the spear went"
100,14,287,clean through him.
100,14,288,"While they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the"
100,14,289,"Achaeans were flying pell - mell to the trench and the set stakes,"
100,14,290,and were forced back within their wall. Hector then cried out to
100,14,291,"the Trojans, “Forward to the ships, and let the spoils be. If I"
100,14,292,see any man keeping back on the other side the wall away from the
100,14,293,ships I will have him killed: his kinsmen and kinswomen shall not
100,14,294,"give him his dues of fire, but dogs shall tear him in pieces in"
100,14,295,front of our city.”
100,14,296,As he spoke he laid his whip about his horses’ shoulders and
100,14,297,called to the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted
100,14,298,"with a cry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck"
100,14,299,"with his own. Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the"
100,14,300,banks of the deep trench into its middle so as to make a great
100,14,301,"broad bridge, as broad as the throw of a spear when a man is"
100,14,302,trying his strength. The Trojan battalions poured over the
100,14,303,"bridge, and Apollo with his redoubtable aegis led the way. He"
100,14,304,kicked down the wall of the Achaeans as easily as a child who
100,14,305,playing on the sea - shore has built a house of sand and then kicks
100,14,306,"it down again and destroys it — even so did you, O Apollo, shed"
100,14,307,"toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with panic and"
100,14,308,confusion.
100,14,309,"Thus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out"
100,14,310,to one another and raising their hands with loud cries every man
100,14,311,"to heaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans,"
100,14,312,"lifted up his hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed"
100,14,313,"more fervently than any of them. “Father Jove,” said he, “if ever"
100,14,314,any one in wheat - growing Argos burned you fat thigh - bones of
100,14,315,"sheep or heifer and prayed that he might return safely home,"
100,14,316,"whereon you bowed your head to him in assent, bear it in mind"
100,14,317,"now, and suffer not the Trojans to triumph thus over the"
100,14,318,Achaeans.”
100,14,319,All - counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to the prayer of
100,14,320,the aged son of Neleus. When they heard Jove thunder they flung
100,14,321,themselves yet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking
100,14,322,over the bulwarks of a ship when the sea runs high before a
100,14,323,gale — for it is the force of the wind that makes the waves so
100,14,324,"great — even so did the Trojans spring over the wall with a shout,"
100,14,325,and drive their chariots onwards. The two sides fought with their
100,14,326,double - pointed spears in hand - to - hand encounter - the Trojans from
100,14,327,"their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing up into their ships and"
100,14,328,wielding the long pikes that were lying on the decks ready for
100,14,329,"use in a sea - fight, jointed and shod with bronze."
100,14,330,"Now Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting"
100,14,331,"about the wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships,"
100,14,332,"remained sitting in the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him"
100,14,333,with his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease
100,14,334,"his pain. When, however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the"
100,14,335,"breach in the wall, while the Achaeans were clamouring and struck"
100,14,336,"with panic, he cried aloud, and smote his two thighs with the"
100,14,337,"flat of his hands. “Eurypylus,” said he in his dismay, “I know"
100,14,338,"you want me badly, but I cannot stay with you any longer, for"
100,14,339,there is hard fighting going on; a servant shall take care of you
100,14,340,"now, for I must make all speed to Achilles, and induce him to"
100,14,341,fight if I can; who knows but with heaven’s help I may persuade
100,14,342,him. A man does well to listen to the advice of a friend.”
100,14,343,When he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm
100,14,344,"and resisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were"
100,14,345,"fewer in number, they could not drive them back from the ships,"
100,14,346,neither could the Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their
100,14,347,way in among the tents and ships. As a carpenter’s line gives a
100,14,348,"true edge to a piece of ship’s timber, in the hand of some"
100,14,349,skilled workman whom Minerva has instructed in all kinds of
100,14,350,useful arts — even so level was the issue of the fight between the
100,14,351,"two sides, as they fought some round one and some round another."
100,14,352,"Hector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about"
100,14,353,the same ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the
100,14,354,"ship, nor yet could Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which"
100,14,355,heaven had brought him.
100,14,356,Then Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear
100,14,357,as he was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the
100,14,358,ground and the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his
100,14,359,cousin fallen in front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and
100,14,360,"Lycians saying, “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close"
100,14,361,"fight, bate not a jot, but rescue the son of Clytius lest the"
100,14,362,Achaeans strip him of his armour now that he has fallen.”
100,14,363,"He then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit"
100,14,364,"Lycophron a follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was"
100,14,365,living with Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the
100,14,366,"Cythereans. Hector’s spear struck him on the head below the ear,"
100,14,367,and he fell headlong from the ship’s prow on to the ground with
100,14,368,no life left in him. Ajax shook with rage and said to his
100,14,369,"brother, “Teucer, my good fellow, our trusty comrade the son of"
100,14,370,"Mastor has fallen, he came to live with us from Cythera and whom"
100,14,371,we honoured as much as our own parents. Hector has just killed
100,14,372,him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which Phoebus
100,14,373,Apollo gave you.”
100,14,374,Teucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver
100,14,375,"in his hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans,"
100,14,376,"and hit Cleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the"
100,14,377,"noble son of Panthous, with the reins in his hands as he was"
100,14,378,attending to his horses; he was in the middle of the very
100,14,379,"thickest part of the fight, doing good service to Hector and the"
100,14,380,"Trojans, but evil had now come upon him, and not one of those who"
100,14,381,"were fain to do so could avert it, for the arrow struck him on"
100,14,382,the back of the neck. He fell from his chariot and his horses
100,14,383,shook the empty car as they swerved aside. King Polydamas saw
100,14,384,"what had happened, and was the first to come up to the horses; he"
100,14,385,"gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon, and ordered him"
100,14,386,"to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He then went"
100,14,387,back and took his place in the front ranks.
100,14,388,"Teucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have"
100,14,389,been no more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed
100,14,390,"him then and there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector,"
100,14,391,"had his eyes on Teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by"
100,14,392,breaking his bowstring for him just as he was drawing it and
100,14,393,about to take his aim; on this the arrow went astray and the bow
100,14,394,fell from his hands. Teucer shook with anger and said to his
100,14,395,"brother, “Alas, see how heaven thwarts us in all we do; it has"
100,14,396,"broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand, though I"
100,14,397,strung it this selfsame morning that it might serve me for many
100,14,398,an arrow.”
100,14,399,"Ajax son of Telamon answered, “My good fellow, let your bow and"
100,14,400,"your arrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite"
100,14,401,"the Danaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder,"
100,14,402,and both fight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so.
100,14,403,They may be successful for the moment but if we fight as we ought
100,14,404,they will find it a hard matter to take the ships.”
100,14,405,Teucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a
100,14,406,"shield four hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely"
100,14,407,head he set his helmet well wrought with a crest of horse - hair
100,14,408,that nodded menacingly above it; he grasped his redoubtable
100,14,409,"bronze - shod spear, and forthwith he was by the side of Ajax."
100,14,410,"When Hector saw that Teucer’s bow was of no more use to him, he"
100,14,411,"shouted out to the Trojans and Lycians, “Trojans, Lycians, and"
100,14,412,"Dardanians good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your"
100,14,413,"mettle here at the ships, for I see the weapon of one of their"
100,14,414,chieftains made useless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see
100,14,415,"when Jove is helping people and means to help them still further,"
100,14,416,or again when he is bringing them down and will do nothing for
100,14,417,"them; he is now on our side, and is going against the Argives."
100,14,418,Therefore swarm round the ships and fight. If any of you is
100,14,419,"struck by spear or sword and loses his life, let him die; he dies"
100,14,420,with honour who dies fighting for his country; and he will leave
100,14,421,"his wife and children safe behind him, with his house and"
100,14,422,allotment unplundered if only the Achaeans can be driven back to
100,14,423,"their own land, they and their ships.”"
100,14,424,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the
100,14,425,"other side exhorted his comrades saying, “Shame on you Argives,"
100,14,426,"we are now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by"
100,14,427,"driving the enemy from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes"
100,14,428,"them, that you will be able to get home by land? Can you not hear"
100,14,429,"him cheering on his whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding"
100,14,430,them remember that they are not at a dance but in battle? Our
100,14,431,only course is to fight them with might and main; we had better
100,14,432,"chance it, life or death, once for all, than fight long and"
100,14,433,without issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than
100,14,434,ourselves.”
100,14,435,With these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then
100,14,436,"killed Schedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and"
100,14,437,Ajax killed Laodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor.
100,14,438,Polydamas killed Otus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus
100,14,439,and chief of the proud Epeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon
100,14,440,"him, but Polydamas crouched down, and he missed him, for Apollo"
100,14,441,would not suffer the son of Panthous to fall in battle; but the
100,14,442,"spear hit Croesmus in the middle of his chest, whereon he fell"
100,14,443,"heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped him of his armour. At"
100,14,444,that moment the valiant soldier Dolops son of Lampus sprang upon
100,14,445,"Lampus was son of Laomedon and noted for his valour, while his"
100,14,446,son Dolops was versed in all the ways of war. He then struck the
100,14,447,"middle of the son of Phyleus’ shield with his spear, setting on"
100,14,448,"him at close quarters, but his good corslet made with plates of"
100,14,449,metal saved him; Phyleus had brought it from Ephyra and the river
100,14,450,"Selleis, where his host, King Euphetes, had given it him to wear"
100,14,451,in battle and protect him. It now served to save the life of his
100,14,452,son. Then Meges struck the topmost crest of Dolops’s bronze
100,14,453,"helmet with his spear and tore away its plume of horse - hair, so"
100,14,454,that all newly dyed with scarlet as it was it tumbled down into
100,14,455,"the dust. While he was still fighting and confident of victory,"
100,14,456,"Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got by the side of Dolops"
100,14,457,"unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder, from behind,"
100,14,458,"and the point, driven so furiously, went through into his chest,"
100,14,459,whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him to strip
100,14,460,"him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers for"
100,14,461,"help, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of"
100,14,462,"Hiketaon, who erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in"
100,14,463,Percote before the war broke out; but when the ships of the
100,14,464,"Danaans came, he went back to Ilius, where he was eminent among"
100,14,465,"the Trojans, and lived near Priam who treated him as one of his"
100,14,466,"own sons. Hector now rebuked him and said, “Why, Melanippus, are"
100,14,467,"we thus remiss? do you take no note of the death of your kinsman,"
100,14,468,and do you not see how they are trying to take Dolops’s armour?
100,14,469,Follow me; there must be no fighting the Argives from a distance
100,14,470,"now, but we must do so in close combat till either we kill them"
100,14,471,or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her people.”
100,14,472,"He led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after."
100,14,473,Meanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. “My
100,14,474,"friends,” he cried, “be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves"
100,14,475,in battle so as to win respect from one another. Men who respect
100,14,476,each other’s good opinion are less likely to be killed than those
100,14,477,"who do not, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory.”"
100,14,478,Thus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back
100,14,479,the Trojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as
100,14,480,"with a wall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus"
100,14,481,"of the loud battle - cry urged Antilochus on. “Antilochus,” said"
100,14,482,"he, “you are young and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet"
100,14,483,of foot or more valiant than you are. See if you cannot spring
100,14,484,upon some Trojan and kill him.”
100,14,485,"He hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once"
100,14,486,"darted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking"
100,14,487,"carefully round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the"
100,14,488,"dart did not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck"
100,14,489,Melanippus the proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple
100,14,490,"as he was coming forward, and his armour rang rattling round him"
100,14,491,as he fell heavily to the ground. Antilochus sprang upon him as a
100,14,492,dog springs on a fawn which a hunter has hit as it was breaking
100,14,493,"away from its covert, and killed it. Even so, O Melanippus, did"
100,14,494,stalwart Antilochus spring upon you to strip you of your armour;
100,14,495,"but noble Hector marked him, and came running up to him through"
100,14,496,"the thick of the battle. Antilochus, brave soldier though he was,"
100,14,497,"would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage creature"
100,14,498,"which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed a"
100,14,499,"dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can"
100,14,500,"be gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor fly, and"
100,14,501,the Trojans and Hector with a cry that rent the air showered
100,14,502,their weapons after him; nor did he turn round and stay his
100,14,503,flight till he had reached his comrades.
100,14,504,"The Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the"
100,14,505,ships in fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them
100,14,506,"on to new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the"
100,14,507,Argives and defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he
100,14,508,"meant giving glory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw"
100,14,509,"fire upon the ships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer"
100,14,510,"that Thetis had made him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he"
100,14,511,should see the glare of a blazing ship. From that hour he was
100,14,512,about so to order that the Trojans should be driven back from the
100,14,513,ships and to vouchsafe glory to the Achaeans. With this purpose
100,14,514,"he inspired Hector son of Priam, who was eager enough already, to"
100,14,515,"assail the ships. His fury was as that of Mars, or as when a fire"
100,14,516,is raging in the glades of some dense forest upon the mountains;
100,14,517,"he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under his terrible"
100,14,518,"eye - brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples by reason of"
100,14,519,"the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was with him, and"
100,14,520,"though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory and"
100,14,521,"glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already Pallas"
100,14,522,Minerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands
100,14,523,"of the son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to break the"
100,14,524,"ranks of the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in"
100,14,525,the goodliest armour; but do what he might he could not break
100,14,526,"through them, for they stood as a tower foursquare, or as some"
100,14,527,high cliff rising from the grey sea that braves the anger of the
100,14,528,"gale, and of the waves that thunder up against it. He fell upon"
100,14,529,"them like flames of fire from every quarter. As when a wave,"
100,14,530,"raised mountain high by wind and storm, breaks over a ship and"
100,14,531,"covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roar against the mast,"
100,14,532,"the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, and they are saved"
100,14,533,but by a very little from destruction — even so were the hearts of
100,14,534,the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lion attacking
100,14,535,a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the
100,14,536,low - lying meadows by some wide - watered shore — the herdsman is at
100,14,537,his wit’s end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now
100,14,538,"in the van and now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion"
100,14,539,springs into the thick of them and fastens on a cow so that they
100,14,540,all tremble for fear — even so were the Achaeans utterly
100,14,541,panic - stricken by Hector and father Jove. Nevertheless Hector
100,14,542,only killed Periphetes of Mycenae; he was son of Copreus who was
100,14,543,"wont to take the orders of King Eurystheus to mighty Hercules,"
100,14,544,but the son was a far better man than the father in every way; he
100,14,545,"was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior, and in understanding ranked"
100,14,546,among the foremost men of Mycenae. He it was who then afforded
100,14,547,"Hector a triumph, for as he was turning back he stumbled against"
100,14,548,"the rim of his shield which reached his feet, and served to keep"
100,14,549,the javelins off him. He tripped against this and fell face
100,14,550,"upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as he did so."
100,14,551,Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a spear
100,14,552,"into his chest, and killed him close to his own comrades. These,"
100,14,553,"for all their sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves"
100,14,554,terribly afraid of Hector.
100,14,555,They had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had
100,14,556,"been drawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans"
100,14,557,came pouring after them. The Argives were driven back from the
100,14,558,"first row of ships, but they made a stand by their tents without"
100,14,559,being broken up and scattered; shame and fear restrained them.
100,14,560,"They kept shouting incessantly to one another, and Nestor of"
100,14,561,"Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, was loudest in"
100,14,562,"imploring every man by his parents, and beseeching him to stand"
100,14,563,firm.
100,14,564,"“Be men, my friends,” he cried, “and respect one another’s good"
100,14,565,"opinion. Think, all of you, on your children, your wives, your"
100,14,566,"property, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On"
100,14,567,"their behalf though they are not here, I implore you to stand"
100,14,568,"firm, and not to turn in flight.”"
100,14,569,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva
100,14,570,"lifted the thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light"
100,14,571,"fell upon them, alike on the side of the ships and on that where"
100,14,572,"the fight was raging. They could see Hector and all his men, both"
100,14,573,"those in the rear who were taking no part in the battle, and"
100,14,574,those who were fighting by the ships.
100,14,575,"Ajax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but"
100,14,576,strode from deck to deck with a great sea - pike in his hands
100,14,577,twelve cubits long and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in
100,14,578,feats of horsemanship couples four horses together and comes
100,14,579,tearing full speed along the public way from the country into
100,14,580,some large town — many both men and women marvel as they see him
100,14,581,"for he keeps all the time changing his horse, springing from one"
100,14,582,to another without ever missing his feet while the horses are at
100,14,583,a gallop — even so did Ajax go striding from one ship’s deck to
100,14,584,"another, and his voice went up into the heavens. He kept on"
100,14,585,shouting his orders to the Danaans and exhorting them to defend
100,14,586,their ships and tents; neither did Hector remain within the main
100,14,587,"body of the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle swoops down upon"
100,14,588,"a flock of wild - fowl feeding near a river — geese, it may be, or"
100,14,589,"cranes, or long - necked swans — even so did Hector make straight for"
100,14,590,"a dark - prowed ship, rushing right towards it; for Jove with his"
100,14,591,"mighty hand impelled him forward, and roused his people to follow"
100,14,592,him.
100,14,593,And now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would
100,14,594,"have thought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so"
100,14,595,fiercely did they fight; and this was the mind in which they
100,14,596,were — the Achaeans did not believe they should escape destruction
100,14,597,"but thought themselves doomed, while there was not a Trojan but"
100,14,598,his heart beat high with the hope of firing the ships and putting
100,14,599,the Achaean heroes to the sword.
100,14,600,Thus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of
100,14,601,"the good ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never"
100,14,602,bore him back to his native land. Round this ship there raged a
100,14,603,close hand - to - hand fight between Danaans and Trojans. They did
100,14,604,"not fight at a distance with bows and javelins, but with one mind"
100,14,605,hacked at one another in close combat with their mighty swords
100,14,606,and spears pointed at both ends; they fought moreover with keen
100,14,607,battle - axes and with hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted and
100,14,608,"scabbarded with iron, fell from hand or shoulder as they fought,"
100,14,609,"and the earth ran red with blood. Hector, when he had seized the"
100,14,610,"ship, would not loose his hold but held on to its curved stern"
100,14,611,"and shouted to the Trojans, “Bring fire, and raise the battle - cry"
100,14,612,all of you with a single voice. Now has Jove vouchsafed us a day
100,14,613,that will pay us for all the rest; this day we shall take the
100,14,614,"ships which came hither against heaven’s will, and which have"
100,14,615,caused us such infinite suffering through the cowardice of our
100,14,616,"councillors, who when I would have done battle at the ships held"
100,14,617,me back and forbade the host to follow me; if Jove did then
100,14,618,"indeed warp our judgements, himself now commands me and cheers me"
100,14,619,on.”
100,14,620,As he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the
100,14,621,"Achaeans, and Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome"
100,14,622,"by the darts that were flung at him, and made sure that he was"
100,14,623,"doomed. Therefore he left the raised deck at the stern, and"
100,14,624,stepped back on to the seven - foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he
100,14,625,"stood on the look - out, and with his spear held back any Trojan"
100,14,626,whom he saw bringing fire to the ships. All the time he kept on
100,14,627,shouting at the top of his voice and exhorting the Danaans. “My
100,14,628,"friends,” he cried, “Danaan heroes, servants of Mars, be men my"
100,14,629,"friends, and fight with might and with main. Can we hope to find"
100,14,630,"helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely than the"
100,14,631,"one we have? There is no strong city within reach, whence we may"
100,14,632,draw fresh forces to turn the scales in our favour. We are on the
100,14,633,"plain of the armed Trojans with the sea behind us, and far from"
100,14,634,"our own country. Our salvation, therefore, is in the might of our"
100,14,635,hands and in hard fighting.”
100,14,636,"As he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and"
100,14,637,when any Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector’s
100,14,638,"bidding, he would be on the look - out for him, and drive at him"
100,14,639,with his long spear. Twelve men did he thus kill in hand - to - hand
100,14,640,fight before the ships.
100,15,1,"Fire being now thrown on the ship of Protesilaus, Patroclus"
100,15,2,"fights in the armour of Achilles — He drives the Trojans back, but"
100,15,3,is in the end killed by Euphorbus and Hector.
100,15,4,Thus did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus
100,15,5,"drew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from"
100,15,6,some spring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high
100,15,7,precipice. When Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for
100,15,8,"him and said, “Why, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like"
100,15,9,"some silly child that comes running to her mother, and begs to be"
100,15,10,taken up and carried — she catches hold of her mother’s dress to
100,15,11,"stay her though she is in a hurry, and looks tearfully up until"
100,15,12,"her mother carries her — even such tears, Patroclus, are you now"
100,15,13,shedding. Have you anything to say to the Myrmidons or to myself?
100,15,14,or have you had news from Phthia which you alone know? They tell
100,15,15,"me Menoetius son of Actor is still alive, as also Peleus son of"
100,15,16,"Aeacus, among the Myrmidons — men whose loss we two should bitterly"
100,15,17,deplore; or are you grieving about the Argives and the way in
100,15,18,"which they are being killed at the ships, through their own"
100,15,19,high - handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell me that
100,15,20,both of us may know about it.”
100,15,21,"Then, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered,"
100,15,22,"“Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do"
100,15,23,"not be angry, but I weep for the disaster that has now befallen"
100,15,24,the Argives. All those who have been their champions so far are
100,15,25,"lying at the ships, wounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son"
100,15,26,"of Tydeus has been hit with a spear, while famed Ulysses and"
100,15,27,Agamemnon have received sword - wounds; Eurypylus again has been
100,15,28,struck with an arrow in the thigh; skilled apothecaries are
100,15,29,"attending to these heroes, and healing them of their wounds; are"
100,15,30,"you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it never be my lot to"
100,15,31,"nurse such a passion as you have done, to the baning of your own"
100,15,32,good name. Who in future story will speak well of you unless you
100,15,33,now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity; knight Peleus
100,15,34,"was not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the grey sea bore"
100,15,35,"you and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel and remorseless are"
100,15,36,you. If however you are kept back through knowledge of some
100,15,37,"oracle, or if your mother Thetis has told you something from the"
100,15,38,"mouth of Jove, at least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if I"
100,15,39,may bring deliverance to the Danaans. Let me moreover wear your
100,15,40,armour; the Trojans may thus mistake me for you and quit the
100,15,41,"field, so that the hard - pressed sons of the Achaeans may have"
100,15,42,breathing time — which while they are fighting may hardly be. We
100,15,43,who are fresh might soon drive tired men back from our ships and
100,15,44,tents to their own city.”
100,15,45,"He knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own"
100,15,46,"destruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, “What, noble"
100,15,47,"Patroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am"
100,15,48,"heeding, nor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of"
100,15,49,"Jove, but I am cut to the very heart that one of my own rank"
100,15,50,should dare to rob me because he is more powerful than I am.
100,15,51,"This, after all that I have gone through, is more than I can"
100,15,52,"endure. The girl whom the sons of the Achaeans chose for me, whom"
100,15,53,I won as the fruit of my spear on having sacked a city — her has
100,15,54,King Agamemnon taken from me as though I were some common
100,15,55,"vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no man may keep his anger"
100,15,56,for ever; I said I would not relent till battle and the cry of
100,15,57,"war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my armour"
100,15,58,"about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the"
100,15,59,dark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the
100,15,60,"Argives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow"
100,15,61,"space, and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out"
100,15,62,"against them, because they see not the visor of my helmet"
100,15,63,"gleaming near them. Had they seen this, there would not have been"
100,15,64,a creek nor grip that had not been filled with their dead as they
100,15,65,"fled back again. And so it would have been, if only King"
100,15,66,Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me. As it is the Trojans have beset
100,15,67,our host. Diomed son of Tydeus no longer wields his spear to
100,15,68,"defend the Danaans, neither have I heard the voice of the son of"
100,15,69,"Atreus coming from his hated head, whereas that of murderous"
100,15,70,"Hector rings in my cars as he gives orders to the Trojans, who"
100,15,71,triumph over the Achaeans and fill the whole plain with their cry
100,15,72,"of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fall upon them and save the"
100,15,73,"fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent us from being able to"
100,15,74,"return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that you may win me great"
100,15,75,"honour from all the Danaans, and that they may restore the girl"
100,15,76,to me again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When you
100,15,77,"have driven the Trojans from the ships, come back again. Though"
100,15,78,"Juno’s thundering husband should put triumph within your reach,"
100,15,79,"do not fight the Trojans further in my absence, or you will rob"
100,15,80,me of glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of battle go
100,15,81,"on killing the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest"
100,15,82,one of the ever - living gods from Olympus attack you — for Phoebus
100,15,83,Apollo loves them well: return when you have freed the ships from
100,15,84,"peril, and let others wage war upon the plain. Would, by father"
100,15,85,"Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that not a single man of all the"
100,15,86,"Trojans might be left alive, nor yet of the Argives, but that we"
100,15,87,two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle that veils the
100,15,88,brow of Troy.”
100,15,89,Thus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground
100,15,90,for the shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove
100,15,91,and the javelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet
100,15,92,that gleamed about his temples rang with the continuous clatter
100,15,93,of the missiles that kept pouring on to it and on to the
100,15,94,cheek - pieces that protected his face. Moreover his left shoulder
100,15,95,"was tired with having held his shield so long, yet for all this,"
100,15,96,"let fly at him as they would, they could not make him give"
100,15,97,"ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the sweat rained from"
100,15,98,"every pore of his body, he had not a moment’s respite, and on all"
100,15,99,sides he was beset by danger upon danger.
100,15,100,"And now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how"
100,15,101,fire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close
100,15,102,up and let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax.
100,15,103,He cut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened
100,15,104,"on to the shaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing"
100,15,105,"but a headless spear, while the bronze point flew some way off"
100,15,106,and came ringing down on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of
100,15,107,"heaven in this, and was dismayed at seeing that Jove had now left"
100,15,108,him utterly defenceless and was willing victory for the Trojans.
100,15,109,"Therefore he drew back, and the Trojans flung fire upon the ship"
100,15,110,which was at once wrapped in flame.
100,15,111,"The fire was now flaring about the ship’s stern, whereon Achilles"
100,15,112,"smote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, “Up, noble knight,"
100,15,113,"for I see the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they"
100,15,114,"destroy our ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat."
100,15,115,Gird on your armour at once while I call our people together.”
100,15,116,As he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his
100,15,117,"legs with greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle - clasps of"
100,15,118,"silver; after this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus,"
100,15,119,richly inlaid and studded. He hung his silver - studded sword of
100,15,120,"bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his"
100,15,121,"comely head he set his helmet, well wrought, with a crest of"
100,15,122,horse - hair that nodded menacingly above it. He grasped two
100,15,123,"redoubtable spears that suited his hands, but he did not take the"
100,15,124,"spear of noble Achilles, so stout and strong, for none other of"
100,15,125,"the Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles could do so easily."
100,15,126,"This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion, which Chiron had cut"
100,15,127,"upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to deal"
100,15,128,out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his horses with
100,15,129,"all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour next after"
100,15,130,"Achilles, and on whose support in battle he could rely most"
100,15,131,firmly. Automedon therefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and
100,15,132,"Balius, steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom"
100,15,133,"the harpy Podarge bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a"
100,15,134,meadow by the waters of the river Oceanus. In the side traces he
100,15,135,"set the noble horse Pedasus, whom Achilles had brought away with"
100,15,136,"him when he sacked the city of Eetion, and who, mortal steed"
100,15,137,"though he was, could take his place along with those that were"
100,15,138,immortal.
100,15,139,"Meanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and"
100,15,140,bade his Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening
100,15,141,wolves that are feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed
100,15,142,"upon the mountains, and their jaws are red with blood — they go in"
100,15,143,a pack to lap water from the clear spring with their long thin
100,15,144,tongues; and they reek of blood and slaughter; they know not what
100,15,145,"fear is, for it is hunger drives them — even so did the leaders and"
100,15,146,counsellors of the Myrmidons gather round the good squire of the
100,15,147,"fleet descendant of Aeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself"
100,15,148,cheering on both men and horses.
100,15,149,"Fifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there"
100,15,150,was a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom
100,15,151,"he could trust, while he was himself commander over them all."
100,15,152,"Menesthius of the gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius"
100,15,153,"that streams from heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair"
100,15,154,Polydora daughter of Peleus bore him to ever - flowing Spercheius — a
100,15,155,woman mated with a god — but he was called son of Borus son of
100,15,156,"Perieres, with whom his mother was living as his wedded wife, and"
100,15,157,who gave great wealth to gain her. The second company was led by
100,15,158,"noble Eudorus, son to an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of"
100,15,159,"Phylas the graceful dancer, bore him; the mighty slayer of Argos"
100,15,160,was enamoured of her as he saw her among the singing women at a
100,15,161,dance held in honour of Diana the rushing huntress of the golden
100,15,162,"arrows; he therefore — Mercury, giver of all good — went with her"
100,15,163,"into an upper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon she"
100,15,164,"bore him a noble son Eudorus, singularly fleet of foot and in"
100,15,165,fight valiant. When Ilithuia goddess of the pains of child - birth
100,15,166,"brought him to the light of day, and he saw the face of the sun,"
100,15,167,"mighty Echecles son of Actor took the mother to wife, and gave"
100,15,168,"great wealth to gain her, but her father Phylas brought the child"
100,15,169,"up, and took care of him, doting as fondly upon him as though he"
100,15,170,were his own son. The third company was led by Pisander son of
100,15,171,"Maemalus, the finest spearman among all the Myrmidons next to"
100,15,172,Achilles’ own comrade Patroclus. The old knight Phoenix was
100,15,173,"captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon, noble son of"
100,15,174,Laerceus of the fifth.
100,15,175,When Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with
100,15,176,"their captains, he charged them straitly saying, “Myrmidons,"
100,15,177,remember your threats against the Trojans while you were at the
100,15,178,"ships in the time of my anger, and you were all complaining of"
100,15,179,"me. ‘Cruel son of Peleus,’ you would say, ‘your mother must have"
100,15,180,"suckled you on gall, so ruthless are you. You keep us here at the"
100,15,181,ships against our will; if you are so relentless it were better
100,15,182,we went home over the sea.’ Often have you gathered and thus
100,15,183,chided with me. The hour is now come for those high feats of arms
100,15,184,"that you have so long been pining for, therefore keep high hearts"
100,15,185,each one of you to do battle with the Trojans.”
100,15,186,"With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they"
100,15,187,serried their companies yet more closely when they heard the
100,15,188,words of their king. As the stones which a builder sets in the
100,15,189,wall of some high house which is to give shelter from the
100,15,190,winds — even so closely were the helmets and bossed shields set
100,15,191,"against one another. Shield pressed on shield, helm on helm, and"
100,15,192,man on man; so close were they that the horse - hair plumes on the
100,15,193,gleaming ridges of their helmets touched each other as they bent
100,15,194,their heads.
100,15,195,In front of them all two men put on their armour — Patroclus and
100,15,196,"Automedon — two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then"
100,15,197,Achilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong
100,15,198,chest which silver - footed Thetis had given him to take on board
100,15,199,"ship, and which she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out"
100,15,200,"the cold, and good thick rugs. In this chest he had a cup of rare"
100,15,201,"workmanship, from which no man but himself might drink, nor would"
100,15,202,he make offering from it to any other god save only to father
100,15,203,Jove. He took the cup from the chest and cleansed it with
100,15,204,"sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, and after he had"
100,15,205,washed his hands he drew wine. Then he stood in the middle of the
100,15,206,"court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making his"
100,15,207,drink - offering of wine; nor was he unseen of Jove whose joy is in
100,15,208,"thunder. “King Jove,” he cried, “lord of Dodona, god of the"
100,15,209,"Pelasgi, who dwellest afar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your"
100,15,210,"sway, where your prophets the Selli dwell around you with their"
100,15,211,feet unwashed and their couches made upon the ground — if you heard
100,15,212,"me when I prayed to you aforetime, and did me honour while you"
100,15,213,"sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe me now the fulfilment of"
100,15,214,yet this further prayer. I shall stay here where my ships are
100,15,215,"lying, but I shall send my comrade into battle at the head of"
100,15,216,"many Myrmidons. Grant, O all - seeing Jove, that victory may go"
100,15,217,with him; put your courage into his heart that Hector may learn
100,15,218,"whether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether his"
100,15,219,might is only then so indomitable when I myself enter the turmoil
100,15,220,of war. Afterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of
100,15,221,"battle from the ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with"
100,15,222,"his armour and his comrades, fighters in close combat.”"
100,15,223,"Thus did he pray, and all - counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part"
100,15,224,of it he did indeed vouchsafe him — but not the whole. He granted
100,15,225,"that Patroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships,"
100,15,226,but refused to let him come safely out of the fight.
100,15,227,"When he had made his drink - offering and had thus prayed, Achilles"
100,15,228,went inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.
100,15,229,"Then he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the"
100,15,230,fierce fight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans.
100,15,231,Meanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till
100,15,232,they sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out
100,15,233,"like wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly"
100,15,234,"children love to tease, whereon any one who happens to be passing"
100,15,235,"may get stung — or again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes"
100,15,236,"them by accident, every wasp will come flying out in a fury to"
100,15,237,defend his little ones — even with such rage and courage did the
100,15,238,"Myrmidons swarm from their ships, and their cry of battle rose"
100,15,239,heavenwards. Patroclus called out to his men at the top of his
100,15,240,"voice, “Myrmidons, followers of Achilles son of Peleus, be men my"
100,15,241,"friends, fight with might and with main, that we may win glory"
100,15,242,"for the son of Peleus, who is far the foremost man at the ships"
100,15,243,"of the Argives — he, and his close fighting followers. The son of"
100,15,244,Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing no
100,15,245,respect to the bravest of the Achaeans.”
100,15,246,"With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they"
100,15,247,fell in a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the
100,15,248,"cry which the Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave"
100,15,249,"son of Menoetius and his squire all gleaming in their armour,"
100,15,250,they were daunted and their battalions were thrown into
100,15,251,"confusion, for they thought the fleet son of Peleus must now have"
100,15,252,"put aside his anger, and have been reconciled to Agamemnon; every"
100,15,253,"one, therefore, looked round about to see whither he might fly"
100,15,254,for safety.
100,15,255,Patroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where
100,15,256,"men were packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of"
100,15,257,Protesilaus. He hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen
100,15,258,from the Amydon and the broad waters of the river Axius; the
100,15,259,"spear struck him on the right shoulder, and with a groan he fell"
100,15,260,backwards in the dust; on this his men were thrown into
100,15,261,"confusion, for by killing their leader, who was the finest"
100,15,262,"soldier among them, Patroclus struck panic into them all. He thus"
100,15,263,drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that was then
100,15,264,blazing — leaving the half - burnt ship to lie where it was. The
100,15,265,"Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent the skies,"
100,15,266,"while the Danaans poured after them from their ships, shouting"
100,15,267,"also without ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the"
100,15,268,"thunder - cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some lofty"
100,15,269,"mountain, and all the peaks, the jutting headlands, and forest"
100,15,270,glades show out in the great light that flashes from the bursting
100,15,271,"heavens, even so when the Danaans had now driven back the fire"
100,15,272,"from their ships, they took breath for a little while; but the"
100,15,273,"fury of the fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were not"
100,15,274,"driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted"
100,15,275,from their ground only by sheer fighting.
100,15,276,"The fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed"
100,15,277,one another when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius
100,15,278,first drove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was
100,15,279,"turning round; the point went clean through, and broke the bone"
100,15,280,so that he fell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the
100,15,281,"chest, where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he"
100,15,282,"fell dead. The son of Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him,"
100,15,283,"and ere he could do so took aim at the upper part of his thigh,"
100,15,284,where the muscles are thicker than in any other part; the spear
100,15,285,"tore through all the sinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed"
100,15,286,"in darkness. Of the sons of Nestor one, Antilochus, speared"
100,15,287,"Atymnius, driving the point of the spear through his throat, and"
100,15,288,down he fell. Maris then sprang on Antilochus in hand - to - hand
100,15,289,"fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body spear in hand;"
100,15,290,"but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him, and in a moment"
100,15,291,had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow; his
100,15,292,"aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root"
100,15,293,"of his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell"
100,15,294,heavily to the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus
100,15,295,did these two noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain
100,15,296,by the two sons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of
100,15,297,"Amisodorus, who had reared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane"
100,15,298,of many. Ajax son of Oileus sprang on Cleobulus and took him
100,15,299,alive as he was entangled in the crush; but he killed him then
100,15,300,and there by a sword - blow on the neck. The sword reeked with his
100,15,301,"blood, while dark death and the strong hand of fate gripped him"
100,15,302,and closed his eyes.
100,15,303,"Peneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed"
100,15,304,each other with their spears. They had both thrown without
100,15,305,"effect, so now they drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed"
100,15,306,"crest of Peneleos’ helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while"
100,15,307,Peneleos smote Lycon on the neck under the ear. The blade sank so
100,15,308,"deep that the head was held on by nothing but the skin, and there"
100,15,309,was no more life left in him. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on
100,15,310,foot and caught him up just as he was about to mount his chariot;
100,15,311,he drove a spear through his right shoulder so that he fell
100,15,312,"headlong from the car, and his eyes were closed in darkness."
100,15,313,Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the bronze point of the
100,15,314,"spear went clean through it beneath the brain, crashing in among"
100,15,315,the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth were all of them
100,15,316,knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from both his
100,15,317,"eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils, and"
100,15,318,the darkness of death enfolded him round about.
100,15,319,Thus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his
100,15,320,"man. As ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them"
100,15,321,when they are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the
100,15,322,main flock through the carelessness of the shepherd — and when the
100,15,323,wolves see this they pounce upon them at once because they cannot
100,15,324,defend themselves — even so did the Danaans now fall on the
100,15,325,"Trojans, who fled with ill - omened cries in their panic and had no"
100,15,326,more fight left in them.
100,15,327,"Meanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector,"
100,15,328,but Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well
100,15,329,"under cover of his ox - hide shield, ever on the look - out for the"
100,15,330,whizzing of the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He well
100,15,331,"knew that the fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood"
100,15,332,his ground and tried to protect his comrades.
100,15,333,"As when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a"
100,15,334,clear sky when Jove is brewing a gale — even with such panic
100,15,335,"stricken rout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in"
100,15,336,their going. Hector’s fleet horses bore him and his armour out of
100,15,337,"the fight, and he left the Trojan host penned in by the deep"
100,15,338,trench against their will. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole
100,15,339,of their chariots in the trench and left their master’s car
100,15,340,"behind them. Patroclus gave chase, calling impetuously on the"
100,15,341,"Danaans and full of fury against the Trojans, who, being now no"
100,15,342,"longer in a body, filled all the ways with their cries of panic"
100,15,343,and rout; the air was darkened with the clouds of dust they
100,15,344,"raised, and the horses strained every nerve in their flight from"
100,15,345,the tents and ships towards the city.
100,15,346,Patroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men
100,15,347,"flying in confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were"
100,15,348,"being smashed in all directions, and many a man came tumbling"
100,15,349,down from his own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of
100,15,350,"Patroclus, whose immortal steeds, given by the gods to Peleus,"
100,15,351,sprang over the trench at a bound as they sped onward. He was
100,15,352,"intent on trying to get near Hector, for he had set his heart on"
100,15,353,"spearing him, but Hector’s horses were now hurrying him away. As"
100,15,354,the whole dark earth bows before some tempest on an autumn day
100,15,355,when Jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving crooked
100,15,356,"judgement in their courts, and driving justice therefrom without"
100,15,357,heed to the decrees of heaven — all the rivers run full and the
100,15,358,torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong from the
100,15,359,"mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of"
100,15,360,men — even such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in
100,15,361,their flight.
100,15,362,Patroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and
100,15,363,drove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach
100,15,364,"the city, but he would not let them, and bore down on them"
100,15,365,between the river and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade
100,15,366,did he then avenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the
100,15,367,"chest where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he"
100,15,368,fell heavily to the ground. Next he sprang on Thestor son of
100,15,369,"Enops, who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot, for he had"
100,15,370,lost his head and the reins had been torn out of his hands.
100,15,371,Patroclus went up to him and drove a spear into his right jaw; he
100,15,372,thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled him over the
100,15,373,"rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of some jutting rock"
100,15,374,and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook and a
100,15,375,line — even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping from
100,15,376,his chariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while
100,15,377,"falling. On this, as Erylaus was on coming to attack him, he"
100,15,378,"struck him full on the head with a stone, and his brains were all"
100,15,379,"battered inside his helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the"
100,15,380,ground and the pangs of death took hold upon him. Then he laid
100,15,381,"low, one after the other, Erymas, Amphoterus, Epaltes,"
100,15,382,"Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris, Ipheus, Euippus and"
100,15,383,Polymelus son of Argeas.
100,15,384,"Now when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled"
100,15,385,"tunics, being overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked"
100,15,386,"the Lycians saying. “Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show"
100,15,387,your mettle; I will myself meet this man in fight and learn who
100,15,388,"it is that is so masterful; he has done us much hurt, and has"
100,15,389,stretched many a brave man upon the ground.”
100,15,390,"He sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he"
100,15,391,"saw this, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at"
100,15,392,one another with loud cries like eagle - beaked crook - taloned
100,15,393,vultures that scream and tear at one another in some high
100,15,394,mountain fastness.
100,15,395,The son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said
100,15,396,"to Juno who was his wife and sister, “Alas, that it should be the"
100,15,397,lot of Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of
100,15,398,Patroclus. I am in two minds whether to catch him up out of the
100,15,399,fight and set him down safe and sound in the fertile land of
100,15,400,"Lycia, or to let him now fall by the hand of the son of"
100,15,401,Menoetius.”
100,15,402,"And Juno answered, “Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that"
100,15,403,"you are saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has"
100,15,404,"long been fated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we"
100,15,405,"shall not all of us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my"
100,15,406,"saying to your heart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own"
100,15,407,"home, some other of the gods will be also wanting to escort his"
100,15,408,"son out of battle, for there are many sons of gods fighting round"
100,15,409,"the city of Troy, and you will make every one jealous. If,"
100,15,410,"however, you are fond of him and pity him, let him indeed fall by"
100,15,411,"the hand of Patroclus, but as soon as the life is gone out of"
100,15,412,"him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him off the field and"
100,15,413,"take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where his brothers and his"
100,15,414,"kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in due honour to the"
100,15,415,dead.”
100,15,416,"The sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood"
100,15,417,upon the earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to
100,15,418,kill on the rich plain of Troy far from his home.
100,15,419,When they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck
100,15,420,"Thrasydemus, the brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of"
100,15,421,"the belly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at"
100,15,422,"Patroclus and missed him, but he struck the horse Pedasus in the"
100,15,423,"right shoulder, and it screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the"
100,15,424,dust until the life went out of it. The other two horses began to
100,15,425,plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked and they got entangled in
100,15,426,the reins through the fall of the horse that was yoked along with
100,15,427,them; but Automedon knew what to do; without the loss of a moment
100,15,428,he drew the keen blade that hung by his sturdy thigh and cut the
100,15,429,"third horse adrift; whereon the other two righted themselves, and"
100,15,430,pulling hard at the reins again went together into battle.
100,15,431,"Sarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed"
100,15,432,"him, the point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without"
100,15,433,"hitting him. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped"
100,15,434,"not from his hand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the"
100,15,435,midriff surrounds the ever - beating heart. He fell like some oak
100,15,436,or silver poplar or tall pine to which woodmen have laid their
100,15,437,axes upon the mountains to make timber for ship - building — even so
100,15,438,did he lie stretched at full length in front of his chariot and
100,15,439,"horses, moaning and clutching at the blood - stained dust. As when"
100,15,440,a lion springs with a bound upon a herd of cattle and fastens on
100,15,441,a great black bull which dies bellowing in its clutches — even so
100,15,442,did the leader of the Lycian warriors struggle in death as he
100,15,443,fell by the hand of Patroclus. He called on his trusty comrade
100,15,444,"and said, “Glaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth all"
100,15,445,"your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit"
100,15,446,yourself like a valiant soldier. First go about among the Lycian
100,15,447,captains and bid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do
100,15,448,battle to save my armour from being taken. My name will haunt you
100,15,449,henceforth and for ever if the Achaeans rob me of my armour now
100,15,450,that I have fallen at their ships. Do your very utmost and call
100,15,451,all my people together.”
100,15,452,Death closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on
100,15,453,"his breast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses"
100,15,454,"came out along with it, and he drew out both spear - point and"
100,15,455,Sarpedon’s soul at the same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his
100,15,456,"snorting steeds, who were wild with panic at finding themselves"
100,15,457,deserted by their lords.
100,15,458,"Glaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said,"
100,15,459,for he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his
100,15,460,"other hand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer’s"
100,15,461,"arrow had given him when Teucer was defending the wall as he,"
100,15,462,"Glaucus, was assailing it. Therefore he prayed to far - darting"
100,15,463,"Apollo saying, “Hear me O king from your seat, may be in the rich"
100,15,464,"land of Lycia, or may be in Troy, for in all places you can hear"
100,15,465,"the prayer of one who is in distress, as I now am. I have a"
100,15,466,"grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain, there is no"
100,15,467,"staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason of my"
100,15,468,"hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go among my foes and"
100,15,469,"fight them, though our prince, Jove’s son Sarpedon, is slain."
100,15,470,"Jove defended not his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me of"
100,15,471,"my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the"
100,15,472,Lycians and to fight along with them round the body of him who
100,15,473,has fallen.”
100,15,474,"Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,"
100,15,475,"staunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new"
100,15,476,"strength. Glaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the"
100,15,477,"mighty god had answered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went"
100,15,478,"among the Lycian captains, and bade them come to fight about the"
100,15,479,body of Sarpedon. From these he strode on among the Trojans to
100,15,480,Polydamas son of Panthous and Agenor; he then went in search of
100,15,481,"Aeneas and Hector, and when he had found them he said, “Hector,"
100,15,482,"you have utterly forgotten your allies, who languish here for"
100,15,483,your sake far from friends and home while you do nothing to
100,15,484,support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycian warriors has
100,15,485,fallen — he who was at once the right and might of Lycia; Mars has
100,15,486,"laid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by him, my friends,"
100,15,487,"and suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to"
100,15,488,treat his body with contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom
100,15,489,we have speared at the ships.”
100,15,490,As he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable
100,15,491,"grief; for Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the"
100,15,492,"main stays of their city, both as having much people with him,"
100,15,493,"and himself the foremost among them all. Led by Hector, who was"
100,15,494,"infuriated by the fall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the"
100,15,495,"Danaans with all their might, while the undaunted spirit of"
100,15,496,Patroclus son of Menoetius cheered on the Achaeans. First he
100,15,497,"spoke to the two Ajaxes, men who needed no bidding. “Ajaxes,”"
100,15,498,"said he, “may it now please you to show yourselves the men you"
100,15,499,"have always been, or even better — Sarpedon is fallen — he who was"
100,15,500,first to overleap the wall of the Achaeans; let us take the body
100,15,501,"and outrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders, and"
100,15,502,kill his comrades if they try to rescue his body.”
100,15,503,"He spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,"
100,15,504,"therefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the"
100,15,505,"Myrmidons and Achaeans on the other, strengthened their"
100,15,506,"battalions, and fought desperately about the body of Sarpedon,"
100,15,507,shouting fiercely the while. Mighty was the din of their armour
100,15,508,"as they came together, and Jove shed a thick darkness over the"
100,15,509,"fight, to increase the toil of the battle over the body of his"
100,15,510,son.
100,15,511,"At first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for"
100,15,512,"one of the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son"
100,15,513,of noble Agacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of
100,15,514,"Budeum; but presently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his"
100,15,515,"own, he took refuge with Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius"
100,15,516,the land of noble steeds to fight the Trojans under Achilles.
100,15,517,Hector now struck him on the head with a stone just as he had
100,15,518,"caught hold of the body, and his brains inside his helmet were"
100,15,519,"all battered in, so that he fell face foremost upon the body of"
100,15,520,"Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was enraged by the death of"
100,15,521,"his comrade, and sped through the front ranks as swiftly as a"
100,15,522,hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings. Even so
100,15,523,"swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, did you make straight for the"
100,15,524,Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith he struck
100,15,525,"Sthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and"
100,15,526,broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this
100,15,527,Hector and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man
100,15,528,"can throw a javelin when competing for some prize, or even in"
100,15,529,battle — so far did the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans.
100,15,530,"Glaucus, captain of the Lycians, was the first to rally them, by"
100,15,531,killing Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived in Hellas and was the
100,15,532,"richest man among the Myrmidons. Glaucus turned round suddenly,"
100,15,533,just as Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of
100,15,534,"him, and drove his spear right into the middle of his chest,"
100,15,535,"whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a"
100,15,536,"man filled the Achaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were"
100,15,537,"exultant, and came up in a body round the corpse. Nevertheless"
100,15,538,"the Achaeans, mindful of their prowess, bore straight down upon"
100,15,539,them.
100,15,540,"Meriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus"
100,15,541,"son of Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was"
100,15,542,honoured by the people as though he were a god. Meriones struck
100,15,543,"him under the jaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the"
100,15,544,darkness of death laid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear
100,15,545,"at Meriones, hoping to hit him under the shield as he was"
100,15,546,"advancing, but Meriones saw it coming and stooped forward to"
100,15,547,"avoid it, whereon the spear flew past him and the point stuck in"
100,15,548,"the ground, while the butt - end went on quivering till Mars robbed"
100,15,549,"it of its force. The spear, therefore, sped from Aeneas’s hand in"
100,15,550,"vain and fell quivering to the ground. Aeneas was angry and said,"
100,15,551,"“Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if I had hit you my spear"
100,15,552,would soon have made an end of you.”
100,15,553,"And Meriones answered, “Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will"
100,15,554,not be able to make an end of every one who comes against you.
100,15,555,"You are only a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in"
100,15,556,"the middle of your shield with my spear, however strong and"
100,15,557,"self - confident you may be, I should soon vanquish you, and you"
100,15,558,would yield your life to Hades of the noble steeds.”
100,15,559,"On this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, “Meriones,"
100,15,560,"hero though you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches,"
100,15,561,"my good friend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead"
100,15,562,"body; some of them must go under ground first; blows for battle,"
100,15,563,"and words for council; fight, therefore, and say nothing.”"
100,15,564,He led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As
100,15,565,the sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the
100,15,566,mountains — and the thud of their axes is heard afar — even such a
100,15,567,din now rose from earth - clash of bronze armour and of good
100,15,568,"ox - hide shields, as men smote each other with their swords and"
100,15,569,spears pointed at both ends. A man had need of good eyesight now
100,15,570,"to know Sarpedon, so covered was he from head to foot with spears"
100,15,571,"and blood and dust. Men swarmed about the body, as flies that"
100,15,572,buzz round the full milk - pails in spring when they are brimming
100,15,573,with milk — even so did they gather round Sarpedon; nor did Jove
100,15,574,"turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight, but kept"
100,15,575,"looking at it all the time, for he was settling how best to kill"
100,15,576,"Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should be allowed to"
100,15,577,"end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and strip"
100,15,578,"him of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet further"
100,15,579,"trouble to the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the"
100,15,580,brave squire of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and
100,15,581,the Trojans back towards the city and take the lives of many.
100,15,582,"First, therefore, he made Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he"
100,15,583,"mounted his chariot and fled, bidding the other Trojans fly also,"
100,15,584,for he saw that the scales of Jove had turned against him.
100,15,585,Neither would the brave Lycians stand firm; they were dismayed
100,15,586,when they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heap of
100,15,587,corpses — for when the son of Saturn made the fight wax hot many
100,15,588,"had fallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore stripped the"
100,15,589,gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son of Menoetius
100,15,590,gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Jove lord of the
100,15,591,"storm - cloud said to Apollo, “Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, and"
100,15,592,take Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black
100,15,593,"blood from off him, and then bear him a long way off where you"
100,15,594,"may wash him in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe"
100,15,595,"him in immortal raiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the"
100,15,596,"two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him"
100,15,597,"straightway to the rich land of Lycia, where his brothers and"
100,15,598,"kinsmen will inter him, and will raise both mound and pillar to"
100,15,599,"his memory, in due honour to the dead.”"
100,15,600,"Thus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father’s saying, and came down"
100,15,601,from the heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he
100,15,602,"took Sarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a"
100,15,603,"long way off, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with"
100,15,604,"ambrosia and clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he"
100,15,605,"committed him to the arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and"
100,15,606,"Sleep, who presently set him down in the rich land of Lycia."
100,15,607,"Meanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to"
100,15,608,"Automedon, pursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and"
100,15,609,foolishness of his heart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the
100,15,610,"son of Peleus, he would have escaped death and have been"
100,15,611,scatheless; but the counsels of Jove pass man’s understanding; he
100,15,612,will put even a brave man to flight and snatch victory from his
100,15,613,"grasp, or again he will set him on to fight, as he now did when"
100,15,614,he put a high spirit into the heart of Patroclus.
100,15,615,"Who then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when"
100,15,616,"the gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus,"
100,15,617,"Autonous, Echeclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and"
100,15,618,"Melanippus; after these he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes."
100,15,619,"These he slew, but the rest saved themselves by flight."
100,15,620,The sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands
100,15,621,"of Patroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not"
100,15,622,Phoebus Apollo taken his stand upon the wall to defeat his
100,15,623,purpose and to aid the Trojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an
100,15,624,"angle of the high wall, and thrice did Apollo beat him back,"
100,15,625,striking his shield with his own immortal hands. When Patroclus
100,15,626,"was coming on like a god for yet a fourth time, Apollo shouted to"
100,15,627,"him with an awful voice and said, “Draw back, noble Patroclus, it"
100,15,628,"is not your lot to sack the city of the Trojan chieftains, nor"
100,15,629,yet will it be that of Achilles who is a far better man than you
100,15,630,"are.” On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew to some distance and"
100,15,631,avoided the anger of Apollo.
100,15,632,Meanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean
100,15,633,"gates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or"
100,15,634,to call the army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting
100,15,635,Phoebus Apollo drew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty
100,15,636,"warrior Asius, who was Hector’s uncle, being own brother to"
100,15,637,"Hecuba, and son of Dymas who lived in Phrygia by the waters of"
100,15,638,the river Sangarius; in his likeness Jove’s son Apollo now spoke
100,15,639,"to Hector saying, “Hector, why have you left off fighting? It is"
100,15,640,"ill done of you. If I were as much better a man than you, as I am"
100,15,641,"worse, you should soon rue your slackness. Drive straight towards"
100,15,642,"Patroclus, if so be that Apollo may grant you a triumph over him,"
100,15,643,and you may rule him.”
100,15,644,"With this the god went back into the hurly - burly, and Hector bade"
100,15,645,Cebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among
100,15,646,"them, and struck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to"
100,15,647,Hector and the Trojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and
100,15,648,"killed no man, but drove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then"
100,15,649,"sprang from his chariot to the ground, with a spear in his left"
100,15,650,"hand, and in his right a jagged stone as large as his hand could"
100,15,651,"hold. He stood still and threw it, nor did it go far without"
100,15,652,"hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, for the stone struck"
100,15,653,"Cebriones, Hector’s charioteer, a bastard son of Priam, as he"
100,15,654,held the reins in his hands. The stone hit him on the forehead
100,15,655,"and drove his brows into his head for the bone was smashed, and"
100,15,656,his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He dropped dead from his
100,15,657,"chariot as though he were diving, and there was no more life left"
100,15,658,"in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O knight Patroclus, saying,"
100,15,659,"“Bless my heart, how active he is, and how well he dives. If we"
100,15,660,had been at sea this fellow would have dived from the ship’s side
100,15,661,"and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could stomach,"
100,15,662,"even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his chariot"
100,15,663,"on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are divers also"
100,15,664,among the Trojans.”
100,15,665,"As he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it"
100,15,666,"were, of a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself"
100,15,667,"struck in the chest, and his courage is his own bane — even so"
100,15,668,"furiously, O Patroclus, did you then spring upon Cebriones."
100,15,669,Hector sprang also from his chariot to the ground. The pair then
100,15,670,fought over the body of Cebriones. As two lions fight fiercely on
100,15,671,"some high mountain over the body of a stag that they have killed,"
100,15,672,"even so did these two mighty warriors, Patroclus son of Menoetius"
100,15,673,"and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another over the corpse of"
100,15,674,Cebriones. Hector would not let him go when he had once got him
100,15,675,"by the head, while Patroclus kept fast hold of his feet, and a"
100,15,676,fierce fight raged between the other Danaans and Trojans. As the
100,15,677,east and south wind buffet one another when they beat upon some
100,15,678,dense forest on the mountains — there is beech and ash and
100,15,679,spreading cornel; the top of the trees roar as they beat on one
100,15,680,"another, and one can hear the boughs cracking and breaking — even"
100,15,681,so did the Trojans and Achaeans spring upon one another and lay
100,15,682,"about each other, and neither side would give way. Many a pointed"
100,15,683,spear fell to ground and many a winged arrow sped from its
100,15,684,"bow - string about the body of Cebriones; many a great stone,"
100,15,685,"moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought around his body,"
100,15,686,"but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and"
100,15,687,"hugely, heedless of his driving now."
100,15,688,So long as the sun was still high in mid - heaven the weapons of
100,15,689,"either side were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he"
100,15,690,"went down towards the time when men loose their oxen, the"
100,15,691,"Achaeans proved to be beyond all forecast stronger, so that they"
100,15,692,drew Cebriones out of range of the darts and tumult of the
100,15,693,"Trojans, and stripped the armour from his shoulders. Then"
100,15,694,Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce intent and a terrific
100,15,695,"shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill nine men; but as"
100,15,696,"he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O Patroclus, was"
100,15,697,"the hour of your end approaching, for Phoebus fought you in fell"
100,15,698,earnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about in the
100,15,699,"crush, for he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god"
100,15,700,struck him from behind on his back and his broad shoulders with
100,15,701,"the flat of his hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus"
100,15,702,"Apollo beat the helmet from off his head, and it rolled rattling"
100,15,703,"off under the horses’ feet, where its horse - hair plumes were all"
100,15,704,begrimed with dust and blood. Never indeed had that helmet fared
100,15,705,"so before, for it had served to protect the head and comely"
100,15,706,"forehead of the godlike hero Achilles. Now, however, Zeus"
100,15,707,delivered it over to be worn by Hector. Nevertheless the end of
100,15,708,"Hector also was near. The bronze - shod spear, so great and so"
100,15,709,"strong, was broken in the hand of Patroclus, while his shield"
100,15,710,that covered him from head to foot fell to the ground as did also
100,15,711,"the band that held it, and Apollo undid the fastenings of his"
100,15,712,corslet.
100,15,713,"On this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he"
100,15,714,stood as one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a
100,15,715,"Dardanian, the best spearman of his time, as also the finest"
100,15,716,"horseman and fleetest runner, came behind him and struck him in"
100,15,717,"the back with a spear, midway between the shoulders. This man as"
100,15,718,soon as ever he had come up with his chariot had dismounted
100,15,719,"twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of war — he it"
100,15,720,"was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove a weapon into you, but"
100,15,721,he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then ran back into the
100,15,722,"crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would"
100,15,723,"not stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed though he now was,"
100,15,724,"to attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god"
100,15,725,"had given him and by the spear - wound, drew back under cover of"
100,15,726,"his men in fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to be"
100,15,727,"wounded and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and"
100,15,728,when close up with him struck him in the lower part of the belly
100,15,729,"with a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so that"
100,15,730,he fell heavily to the ground to the great grief of the Achaeans.
100,15,731,As when a lion has fought some fierce wild - boar and worsted
100,15,732,him — the two fight furiously upon the mountains over some little
100,15,733,"fountain at which they would both drink, and the lion has beaten"
100,15,734,the boar till he can hardly breathe — even so did Hector son of
100,15,735,Priam take the life of the brave son of Menoetius who had killed
100,15,736,"so many, striking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him"
100,15,737,"the while. “Patroclus,” said he, “you deemed that you should sack"
100,15,738,"our city, rob our Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them"
100,15,739,off in your ships to your own country. Fool; Hector and his fleet
100,15,740,horses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I am
100,15,741,foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage
100,15,742,"from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor"
100,15,743,"wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; and"
100,15,744,"yet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly saying,"
100,15,745,"‘Come not back to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have rent"
100,15,746,the bloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body.’ Thus
100,15,747,"I ween did he charge you, and your fool’s heart answered him"
100,15,748,‘yea’ within you.”
100,15,749,"Then, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight"
100,15,750,"Patroclus: “Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn"
100,15,751,and Apollo have vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have
100,15,752,"vanquished me so easily, and they who have stripped the armour"
100,15,753,"from my shoulders; had twenty such men as you attacked me, all of"
100,15,754,them would have fallen before my spear. Fate and the son of Leto
100,15,755,"have overpowered me, and among mortal men Euphorbus; you are"
100,15,756,"yourself third only in the killing of me. I say further, and lay"
100,15,757,"my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a little"
100,15,758,"season; death and the day of your doom are close upon you, and"
100,15,759,they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles son of Aeacus.”
100,15,760,"When he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul"
100,15,761,"left his body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning"
100,15,762,its sad fate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its
100,15,763,"manhood. Dead though he was, Hector still spoke to him saying,"
100,15,764,"“Patroclus, why should you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but"
100,15,765,"Achilles, son of lovely Thetis, may be smitten by my spear and"
100,15,766,die before me?”
100,15,767,"As he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his"
100,15,768,"foot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back."
100,15,769,"He then went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet"
100,15,770,"descendant of Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the"
100,15,771,immortal steeds which the gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus
100,15,772,bore him swiftly from the field.
100,16,1,The fight around the body of Patroclus.
100,16,2,Brave Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had
100,16,3,"fallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full"
100,16,4,armour to bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first
100,16,5,"calf, even so did yellow - haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He"
100,16,6,"held his round shield and his spear in front of him, resolute to"
100,16,7,kill any who should dare face him. But the son of Panthous had
100,16,8,"also noted the body, and came up to Menelaus saying, “Menelaus,"
100,16,9,"son of Atreus, draw back, leave the body, and let the"
100,16,10,bloodstained spoils be. I was first of the Trojans and their
100,16,11,"brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, let me, therefore,"
100,16,12,"have my full glory among the Trojans, or I will take aim and kill"
100,16,13,you.”
100,16,14,"To this Menelaus answered in great anger “By father Jove,"
100,16,15,"boasting is an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion"
100,16,16,"nor savage wild - boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all"
100,16,17,"creatures, than are the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did"
100,16,18,not see out the days of his youth when he made light of me and
100,16,19,"withstood me, deeming me the meanest soldier among the Danaans."
100,16,20,His own feet never bore him back to gladden his wife and parents.
100,16,21,"Even so shall I make an end of you too, if you withstand me; get"
100,16,22,"you back into the crowd and do not face me, or it shall be worse"
100,16,23,for you. Even a fool may be wise after the event.”
100,16,24,"Euphorbus would not listen, and said, “Now indeed, Menelaus,"
100,16,25,"shall you pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted,"
100,16,26,"and whose wife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you"
100,16,27,brought grief unspeakable on his parents. I shall comfort these
100,16,28,poor people if I bring your head and armour and place them in the
100,16,29,hands of Panthous and noble Phrontis. The time is come when this
100,16,30,"matter shall be fought out and settled, for me or against me.”"
100,16,31,"As he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear"
100,16,32,"did not go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus"
100,16,33,"then took aim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was"
100,16,34,"drawing back, and Menelaus struck him about the roots of his"
100,16,35,"throat, leaning his whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it"
100,16,36,"home. The point went clean through his neck, and his armour rang"
100,16,37,rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. His hair
100,16,38,"which was like that of the Graces, and his locks so deftly bound"
100,16,39,"in bands of silver and gold, were all bedrabbled with blood. As"
100,16,40,one who has grown a fine young olive tree in a clear space where
100,16,41,"there is abundance of water — the plant is full of promise, and"
100,16,42,though the winds beat upon it from every quarter it puts forth
100,16,43,its white blossoms till the blasts of some fierce hurricane sweep
100,16,44,down upon it and level it with the ground — even so did Menelaus
100,16,45,strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour after he had slain
100,16,46,him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride of
100,16,47,his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is
100,16,48,"feeding — first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then"
100,16,49,gorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue
100,16,50,"and cry against him, but they stand aloof and will not come close"
100,16,51,"to him, for they are pale with fear — even so no one had the"
100,16,52,courage to face valiant Menelaus. The son of Atreus would have
100,16,53,"then carried off the armour of the son of Panthous with ease, had"
100,16,54,"not Phoebus Apollo been angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief"
100,16,55,"of the Cicons incited Hector to attack him. “Hector,” said he,"
100,16,56,"“you are now going after the horses of the noble son of Aeacus,"
100,16,57,but you will not take them; they cannot be kept in hand and
100,16,58,"driven by mortal man, save only by Achilles, who is son to an"
100,16,59,immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus son of Atreus has bestridden
100,16,60,"the body of Patroclus and killed the noblest of the Trojans,"
100,16,61,"Euphorbus son of Panthous, so that he can fight no more.”"
100,16,62,"The god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of"
100,16,63,Hector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the
100,16,64,ranks and saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still
100,16,65,"flowing from his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour."
100,16,66,"On this he made his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad"
100,16,67,"in his gleaming armour, and crying with a loud voice. When the"
100,16,68,"son of Atreus heard him, he said to himself in his dismay, “Alas!"
100,16,69,what shall I do? I may not let the Trojans take the armour of
100,16,70,"Patroclus who has fallen fighting on my behalf, lest some Danaan"
100,16,71,who sees me should cry shame upon me. Still if for my honour’s
100,16,72,"sake I fight Hector and the Trojans single - handed, they will"
100,16,73,"prove too many for me, for Hector is bringing them up in force."
100,16,74,"Why, however, should I thus hesitate? When a man fights in"
100,16,75,"despite of heaven with one whom a god befriends, he will soon rue"
100,16,76,"it. Let no Danaan think ill of me if I give place to Hector, for"
100,16,77,"the hand of heaven is with him. Yet, if I could find Ajax, the"
100,16,78,"two of us would fight Hector and heaven too, if we might only"
100,16,79,"save the body of Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus. This, of"
100,16,80,many evils would be the least.”
100,16,81,"While he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with"
100,16,82,"Hector at their head; he therefore drew back and left the body,"
100,16,83,turning about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs
100,16,84,"and men from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he"
100,16,85,is daunted and slinks sulkily off — even so did Menelaus son of
100,16,86,Atreus turn and leave the body of Patroclus. When among the body
100,16,87,"of his men, he looked around for mighty Ajax son of Telamon, and"
100,16,88,"presently saw him on the extreme left of the fight, cheering on"
100,16,89,"his men and exhorting them to keep on fighting, for Phoebus"
100,16,90,Apollo had spread a great panic among them. He ran up to him and
100,16,91,"said, “Ajax, my good friend, come with me at once to dead"
100,16,92,"Patroclus, if so be that we may take the body to Achilles — as for"
100,16,93,"his armour, Hector already has it.”"
100,16,94,"These words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among"
100,16,95,"the front ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped"
100,16,96,"Patroclus of his armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his"
100,16,97,head and take the body to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax
100,16,98,"came up with his shield like wall before him, on which Hector"
100,16,99,"withdrew under shelter of his men, and sprang on to his chariot,"
100,16,100,"giving the armour over to the Trojans to take to the city, as a"
100,16,101,"great trophy for himself; Ajax, therefore, covered the body of"
100,16,102,Patroclus with his broad shield and bestrode him; as a lion
100,16,103,stands over his whelps if hunters have come upon him in a forest
100,16,104,when he is with his little ones — in the pride and fierceness of
100,16,105,his strength he draws his knit brows down till they cover his
100,16,106,"eyes — even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, and by his"
100,16,107,"side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow in his"
100,16,108,heart.
100,16,109,Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and
100,16,110,"rebuked him sternly. “Hector,” said he, “you make a brave show,"
100,16,111,but in fight you are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has
100,16,112,no claim to so great a reputation. Think how you may now save
100,16,113,your town and citadel by the hands of your own people born in
100,16,114,"Ilius; for you will get no Lycians to fight for you, seeing what"
100,16,115,thanks they have had for their incessant hardships. Are you
100,16,116,"likely, sir, to do anything to help a man of less note, after"
100,16,117,"leaving Sarpedon, who was at once your guest and comrade in arms,"
100,16,118,to be the spoil and prey of the Danaans? So long as he lived he
100,16,119,did good service both to your city and yourself; yet you had no
100,16,120,stomach to save his body from the dogs. If the Lycians will
100,16,121,"listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to its fate. If"
100,16,122,the Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays
100,16,123,hold of men who are fighting for their country and harassing
100,16,124,"those who would attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into"
100,16,125,Ilius. Could we get this dead man away and bring him into the
100,16,126,"city of Priam, the Argives would readily give up the armour of"
100,16,127,"Sarpedon, and we should get his body to boot. For he whose squire"
100,16,128,has been now killed is the foremost man at the ships of the
100,16,129,Achaeans — he and his close - fighting followers. Nevertheless you
100,16,130,"dared not make a stand against Ajax, nor face him, eye to eye,"
100,16,131,"with battle all round you, for he is a braver man than you are.”"
100,16,132,"Hector scowled at him and answered, “Glaucus, you should know"
100,16,133,better. I have held you so far as a man of more understanding
100,16,134,"than any in all Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am"
100,16,135,"afraid of Ajax. I fear neither battle nor the din of chariots,"
100,16,136,but Jove’s will is stronger than ours; Jove at one time makes
100,16,137,"even a strong man draw back and snatches victory from his grasp,"
100,16,138,"while at another he will set him on to fight. Come hither then,"
100,16,139,"my friend, stand by me and see indeed whether I shall play the"
100,16,140,"coward the whole day through as you say, or whether I shall not"
100,16,141,stay some even of the boldest Danaans from fighting round the
100,16,142,body of Patroclus.”
100,16,143,"As he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, “Trojans,"
100,16,144,"Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my"
100,16,145,"friends, and fight might and main, while I put on the goodly"
100,16,146,"armour of Achilles, which I took when I killed Patroclus.”"
100,16,147,"With this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men"
100,16,148,"who were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet"
100,16,149,"got far. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he"
100,16,150,changed his armour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius
100,16,151,"and to the Trojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the"
100,16,152,"son of Peleus, which the gods had given to Peleus, who in his age"
100,16,153,gave it to his son; but the son did not grow old in his father’s
100,16,154,armour.
100,16,155,"When Jove, lord of the storm - cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and"
100,16,156,"arming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged his"
100,16,157,"head and muttered to himself saying, “A! poor wretch, you arm in"
100,16,158,"the armour of a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you"
100,16,159,reck nothing of the doom that is already close upon you. You have
100,16,160,"killed his comrade so brave and strong, but it was not well that"
100,16,161,you should strip the armour from his head and shoulders. I do
100,16,162,"indeed endow you with great might now, but as against this you"
100,16,163,shall not return from battle to lay the armour of the son of
100,16,164,Peleus before Andromache.”
100,16,165,"The son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted"
100,16,166,"the armour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, and"
100,16,167,filled his whole body with might and valour. With a shout he
100,16,168,"strode in among the allies, and his armour flashed about him so"
100,16,169,that he seemed to all of them like the great son of Peleus
100,16,170,"himself. He went about among them and cheered them on — Mesthles,"
100,16,171,"Glaucus, Medon, Thersilochus, Asteropaeus, Deisenor and"
100,16,172,"Hippothous, Phorcys, Chromius and Ennomus the augur. All these"
100,16,173,"did he exhort saying, “Hear me, allies from other cities who are"
100,16,174,"here in your thousands, it was not in order to have a crowd about"
100,16,175,"me that I called you hither each from his several city, but that"
100,16,176,with heart and soul you might defend the wives and little ones of
100,16,177,the Trojans from the fierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress my
100,16,178,people with your food and the presents that make you rich.
100,16,179,"Therefore turn, and charge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the"
100,16,180,"game of war; whoever shall bring Patroclus, dead though he be,"
100,16,181,"into the hands of the Trojans, and shall make Ajax give way"
100,16,182,"before him, I will give him one half of the spoils while I keep"
100,16,183,the other. He will thus share like honour with myself.”
100,16,184,When he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans
100,16,185,"with their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran"
100,16,186,high that he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the
100,16,187,"body — fools that they were, for he was about to take the lives of"
100,16,188,"many. Then Ajax said to Menelaus, “My good friend Menelaus, you"
100,16,189,and I shall hardly come out of this fight alive. I am less
100,16,190,"concerned for the body of Patroclus, who will shortly become meat"
100,16,191,"for the dogs and vultures of Troy, than for the safety of my own"
100,16,192,head and yours. Hector has wrapped us round in a storm of battle
100,16,193,"from every quarter, and our destruction seems now certain. Call"
100,16,194,then upon the princes of the Danaans if there is any who can hear
100,16,195,us.”
100,16,196,"Menelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at"
100,16,197,"the top of his voice. “My friends,” he cried, “princes and"
100,16,198,"counsellors of the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and"
100,16,199,"Menelaus drink at the public cost, and give orders each to his"
100,16,200,"own people as Jove vouchsafes him power and glory, the fight is"
100,16,201,so thick about me that I cannot distinguish you severally; come
100,16,202,"on, therefore, every man unbidden, and think it shame that"
100,16,203,Patroclus should become meat and morsel for Trojan hounds.”
100,16,204,Fleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way
100,16,205,through the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and
100,16,206,"Meriones his esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others"
100,16,207,"that came into the fight after these, who of his own self could"
100,16,208,name them?
100,16,209,The Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a
100,16,210,great wave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some
100,16,211,"heaven - born river, and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with"
100,16,212,the roar of the breakers that beat and buffet them — even with such
100,16,213,a roar did the Trojans come on; but the Achaeans in singleness of
100,16,214,"heart stood firm about the son of Menoetius, and fenced him with"
100,16,215,"their bronze shields. Jove, moreover, hid the brightness of their"
100,16,216,"helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borne no grudge against the"
100,16,217,son of Menoetius while he was still alive and squire to the
100,16,218,descendant of Aeacus; therefore he was loth to let him fall a
100,16,219,"prey to the dogs of his foes the Trojans, and urged his comrades"
100,16,220,on to defend him.
100,16,221,"At first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew"
100,16,222,from the dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing
100,16,223,"any one, nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans"
100,16,224,"did not lose it long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after"
100,16,225,"the son of Peleus alike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied"
100,16,226,them and made towards the front like a wild boar upon the
100,16,227,mountains when he stands at bay in the forest glades and routs
100,16,228,the hounds and lusty youths that have attacked him — even so did
100,16,229,Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in among the phalanxes of the
100,16,230,"Trojans, disperse those who had bestridden Patroclus and were"
100,16,231,most bent on winning glory by dragging him off to their city. At
100,16,232,"this moment Hippothous brave son of the Pelasgian Lethus, in his"
100,16,233,"zeal for Hector and the Trojans, was dragging the body off by the"
100,16,234,"foot through the press of the fight, having bound a strap round"
100,16,235,the sinews near the ancle; but a mischief soon befell him from
100,16,236,"which none of those could save him who would have gladly done so,"
100,16,237,for the son of Telamon sprang forward and smote him on his
100,16,238,bronze - cheeked helmet. The plumed headpiece broke about the point
100,16,239,"of the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the strong hand"
100,16,240,"of Ajax, so that the bloody brain came oozing out through the"
100,16,241,crest - socket. His strength then failed him and he let Patroclus’
100,16,242,"foot drop from his hand, as he fell full length dead upon the"
100,16,243,"body; thus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, and"
100,16,244,"never repaid his parents the cost of bringing him up, for his"
100,16,245,life was cut short early by the spear of mighty Ajax. Hector then
100,16,246,"took aim at Ajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and just"
100,16,247,managed to avoid it; the spear passed on and struck Schedius son
100,16,248,"of noble Iphitus, captain of the Phoceans, who dwelt in famed"
100,16,249,Panopeus and reigned over much people; it struck him under the
100,16,250,middle of the collar - bone the bronze point went right through
100,16,251,"him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder - blade, and his"
100,16,252,armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
100,16,253,Ajax in his turn struck noble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the
100,16,254,"middle of the belly as he was bestriding Hippothous, and broke"
100,16,255,the plate of his cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his entrails
100,16,256,and he clutched the ground in his palm as he fell to earth.
100,16,257,"Hector and those who were in the front rank then gave ground,"
100,16,258,"while the Argives raised a loud cry of triumph, and drew off the"
100,16,259,bodies of Phorcys and Hippothous which they stripped presently of
100,16,260,their armour.
100,16,261,The Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and
100,16,262,"driven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the"
100,16,263,"Argives, so great was their courage and endurance, would have"
100,16,264,"achieved a triumph even against the will of Jove, if Apollo had"
100,16,265,"not roused Aeneas, in the likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an"
100,16,266,attendant who had grown old in the service of Aeneas’ aged
100,16,267,"father, and was at all times devoted to him. In his likeness,"
100,16,268,"then, Apollo said, “Aeneas, can you not manage, even though"
100,16,269,"heaven be against us, to save high Ilius? I have known men, whose"
100,16,270,"numbers, courage, and self - reliance have saved their people in"
100,16,271,"spite of Jove, whereas in this case he would much rather give"
100,16,272,"victory to us than to the Danaans, if you would only fight"
100,16,273,instead of being so terribly afraid.”
100,16,274,"Aeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to"
100,16,275,"Hector saying, “Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on"
100,16,276,us if we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius
100,16,277,through our own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told
100,16,278,me that Jove the supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let
100,16,279,"us make for the Danaans, that it may go hard with them ere they"
100,16,280,bear away dead Patroclus to the ships.”
100,16,281,"As he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then"
100,16,282,rallied and again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus
100,16,283,"son of Arisbas, a valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes"
100,16,284,was moved with pity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close
100,16,285,"up, and speared Apisaon son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in"
100,16,286,"the liver under the midriff, so that he died; he had come from"
100,16,287,fertile Paeonia and was the best man of them all after
100,16,288,Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forward to avenge him and attack
100,16,289,"the Danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch as those about"
100,16,290,"Patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held their"
100,16,291,"spears in front of them, for Ajax had given them strict orders"
100,16,292,"that no man was either to give ground, or to stand out before the"
100,16,293,"others, but all were to hold well together about the body and"
100,16,294,"fight hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth"
100,16,295,ran red with blood as the corpses fell thick on one another alike
100,16,296,"on the side of the Trojans and allies, and on that of the"
100,16,297,"Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless fight though"
100,16,298,"many fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defend"
100,16,299,and stand by one another.
100,16,300,Thus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as
100,16,301,"though it had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were"
100,16,302,hidden over all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting
100,16,303,"about the dead son of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and"
100,16,304,Achaeans fought at their ease in full daylight with brilliant
100,16,305,"sunshine all round them, and there was not a cloud to be seen"
100,16,306,neither on plain nor mountain. These last moreover would rest for
100,16,307,"a while and leave off fighting, for they were some distance apart"
100,16,308,"and beyond the range of one another’s weapons, whereas those who"
100,16,309,were in the thick of the fray suffered both from battle and
100,16,310,darkness. All the best of them were being worn out by the great
100,16,311,"weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes, Thrasymedes"
100,16,312,"and Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of Patroclus, and"
100,16,313,believed him to be still alive and leading the van against the
100,16,314,Trojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve against the
100,16,315,"death or rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered"
100,16,316,when he sent them from the ships into battle.
100,16,317,"Thus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the"
100,16,318,"sweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on"
100,16,319,"their hands and eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet"
100,16,320,son of Peleus. It was as when a man gives a great ox - hide all
100,16,321,"drenched in fat to his men, and bids them stretch it; whereon"
100,16,322,they stand round it in a ring and tug till the moisture leaves
100,16,323,"it, and the fat soaks in for the many that pull at it, and it is"
100,16,324,well stretched — even so did the two sides tug the dead body hither
100,16,325,and thither within the compass of but a little space — the Trojans
100,16,326,"steadfastly set on dragging it into Ilius, while the Achaeans"
100,16,327,were no less so on taking it to their ships; and fierce was the
100,16,328,"fight between them. Not Mars himself the lord of hosts, nor yet"
100,16,329,"Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make light of such a"
100,16,330,battle.
100,16,331,Such fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day
100,16,332,ordain round the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not
100,16,333,"know that he had fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy"
100,16,334,"a long way off the ships. He had no idea, therefore, that"
100,16,335,"Patroclus was dead, and deemed that he would return alive as soon"
100,16,336,as he had gone close up to the gates. He knew that he was not to
100,16,337,"sack the city neither with nor without himself, for his mother"
100,16,338,"had often told him this when he had sat alone with her, and she"
100,16,339,"had informed him of the counsels of great Jove. Now, however, she"
100,16,340,had not told him how great a disaster had befallen him in the
100,16,341,death of the one who was far dearest to him of all his comrades.
100,16,342,The others still kept on charging one another round the body with
100,16,343,"their pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say,"
100,16,344,"“My friends, we can never again show our faces at the"
100,16,345,"ships — better, and greatly better, that earth should open and"
100,16,346,"swallow us here in this place, than that we should let the"
100,16,347,Trojans have the triumph of bearing off Patroclus to their city.”
100,16,348,"The Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying,"
100,16,349,"“Friends, though we fall to a man beside this body, let none"
100,16,350,shrink from fighting.” With such words did they exhort each
100,16,351,"other. They fought and fought, and an iron clank rose through the"
100,16,352,void air to the brazen vault of heaven. The horses of the
100,16,353,descendant of Aeacus stood out of the fight and wept when they
100,16,354,heard that their driver had been laid low by the hand of
100,16,355,"murderous Hector. Automedon, valiant son of Diores, lashed them"
100,16,356,"again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and"
100,16,357,"many a time did he upbraid them, but they would neither go back"
100,16,358,"to the ships by the waters of the broad Hellespont, nor yet into"
100,16,359,battle among the Achaeans; they stood with their chariot stock
100,16,360,"still, as a pillar set over the tomb of some dead man or woman,"
100,16,361,and bowed their heads to the ground. Hot tears fell from their
100,16,362,"eyes as they mourned the loss of their charioteer, and their"
100,16,363,noble manes drooped all wet from under the yokestraps on either
100,16,364,side the yoke.
100,16,365,The son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He
100,16,366,"wagged his head, and muttered to himself, saying, “Poor things,"
100,16,367,"why did we give you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are"
100,16,368,yourselves ageless and immortal? Was it that you might share the
100,16,369,sorrows that befall mankind? for of all creatures that live and
100,16,370,"move upon the earth there is none so pitiable as he is — still,"
100,16,371,Hector son of Priam shall drive neither you nor your chariot. I
100,16,372,will not have it. It is enough that he should have the armour
100,16,373,over which he vaunts so vainly. Furthermore I will give you
100,16,374,strength of heart and limb to bear Automedon safely to the ships
100,16,375,"from battle, for I shall let the Trojans triumph still further,"
100,16,376,and go on killing till they reach the ships; whereon night shall
100,16,377,fall and darkness overshadow the land.”
100,16,378,As he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so
100,16,379,"that they shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their"
100,16,380,chariot swiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and
100,16,381,Achaeans. Behind them fought Automedon full of sorrow for his
100,16,382,"comrade, as a vulture amid a flock of geese. In and out, and here"
100,16,383,"and there, full speed he dashed amid the throng of the Trojans,"
100,16,384,"but for all the fury of his pursuit he killed no man, for he"
100,16,385,could not wield his spear and keep his horses in hand when alone
100,16,386,"in the chariot; at last, however, a comrade, Alcimedon, son of"
100,16,387,Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of him and came up behind his
100,16,388,"chariot. “Automedon,” said he, “what god has put this folly into"
100,16,389,"your heart and robbed you of your right mind, that you fight the"
100,16,390,Trojans in the front rank single - handed? He who was your comrade
100,16,391,"is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed in the armour"
100,16,392,of the descendant of Aeacus.”
100,16,393,"Automedon son of Diores answered, “Alcimedon, there is no one"
100,16,394,else who can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you
100,16,395,"can, save only Patroclus — while he was alive — peer of gods in"
100,16,396,"counsel. Take then the whip and reins, while I go down from the"
100,16,397,car and fight.”
100,16,398,"Alcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and"
100,16,399,"reins, while Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw"
100,16,400,"him he said to Aeneas who was near him, “Aeneas, counsellor of"
100,16,401,"the mail - clad Trojans, I see the steeds of the fleet son of"
100,16,402,"Aeacus come into battle with weak hands to drive them. I am sure,"
100,16,403,"if you think well, that we might take them; they will not dare"
100,16,404,face us if we both attack them.”
100,16,405,"The valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair"
100,16,406,"went right on, with their shoulders covered under shields of"
100,16,407,"tough dry ox - hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus"
100,16,408,"went also with them, and their hearts beat high with hope that"
100,16,409,they might kill the men and capture the horses — fools that they
100,16,410,"were, for they were not to return scatheless from their meeting"
100,16,411,"with Automedon, who prayed to father Jove and was forthwith"
100,16,412,filled with courage and strength abounding. He turned to his
100,16,413,"trusty comrade Alcimedon and said, “Alcimedon, keep your horses"
100,16,414,so close up that I may feel their breath upon my back; I doubt
100,16,415,that we shall not stay Hector son of Priam till he has killed us
100,16,416,and mounted behind the horses; he will then either spread panic
100,16,417,"among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himself be killed among the"
100,16,418,foremost.”
100,16,419,"On this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, “Ajaxes"
100,16,420,"captains of the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to"
100,16,421,"them that are best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of"
100,16,422,us living; for Hector and Aeneas who are the two best men among
100,16,423,"the Trojans, are pressing us hard in the full tide of war."
100,16,424,"Nevertheless the issue lies on the lap of heaven, I will"
100,16,425,therefore hurl my spear and leave the rest to Jove.”
100,16,426,"He poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the"
100,16,427,"round shield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield"
100,16,428,"stayed it not, so that it was driven through his belt into the"
100,16,429,"lower part of his belly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand,"
100,16,430,deals his blow behind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons
100,16,431,at the back of its neck so that it springs forward and then
100,16,432,"drops, even so did Aretus give one bound and then fall on his"
100,16,433,back the spear quivering in his body till it made an end of him.
100,16,434,Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but he saw it coming and
100,16,435,"stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew past him and the"
100,16,436,"point stuck in the ground, while the butt - end went on quivering"
100,16,437,till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then have fought
100,16,438,hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced their way
100,16,439,"through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and"
100,16,440,"parted them for all their fury — for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius"
100,16,441,"were afraid and drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to"
100,16,442,"the heart. Automedon, peer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of"
100,16,443,"his armour and vaunted over him saying, “I have done little to"
100,16,444,"assuage my sorrow for the son of Menoetius, for the man I have"
100,16,445,killed is not so good as he was.”
100,16,446,As he spoke he took the blood - stained spoils and laid them upon
100,16,447,his chariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all
100,16,448,steeped in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.
100,16,449,"And now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus,"
100,16,450,for Minerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the
100,16,451,"command of far - seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her"
100,16,452,to encourage the Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in
100,16,453,heaven in token to mankind either of war or of the chill storms
100,16,454,"that stay men from their labour and plague the flocks — even so,"
100,16,455,"wrapped in such radiant raiment, did Minerva go in among the host"
100,16,456,and speak man by man to each. First she took the form and voice
100,16,457,"of Phoenix and spoke to Menelaus son of Atreus, who was standing"
100,16,458,"near her. “Menelaus,” said she, “it will be shame and dishonour"
100,16,459,"to you, if dogs tear the noble comrade of Achilles under the"
100,16,460,"walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and urge your men to be so"
100,16,461,also.”
100,16,462,"Menelaus answered, “Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva"
100,16,463,"vouchsafe me strength and keep the darts from off me, for so"
100,16,464,shall I stand by Patroclus and defend him; his death has gone to
100,16,465,"my heart, but Hector is as a raging fire and deals his blows"
100,16,466,"without ceasing, for Jove is now granting him a time of triumph.”"
100,16,467,Minerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the
100,16,468,other gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and
100,16,469,"shoulders, and made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven"
100,16,470,"off will yet come again and bite if it can, so dearly does it"
100,16,471,love man’s blood — even so bold as this did she make him as he
100,16,472,stood over Patroclus and threw his spear. Now there was among the
100,16,473,"Trojans a man named Podes, son of Eetion, who was both rich and"
100,16,474,valiant. Hector held him in the highest honour for he was his
100,16,475,comrade and boon companion; the spear of Menelaus struck this man
100,16,476,"in the girdle just as he had turned in flight, and went right"
100,16,477,"through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward, and Menelaus son of"
100,16,478,Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of his
100,16,479,own people.
100,16,480,"Apollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the"
100,16,481,likeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the
100,16,482,most favoured of all Hector’s guests. In his likeness Apollo
100,16,483,"said, “Hector, who of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now"
100,16,484,that you have quailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated
100,16,485,poorly as a soldier? Yet he has now got a corpse away from the
100,16,486,"Trojans single - handed, and has slain your own true comrade, a man"
100,16,487,"brave among the foremost, Podes son of Eetion.”"
100,16,488,"A dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made"
100,16,489,his way to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of
100,16,490,"Saturn seized his bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in"
100,16,491,"cloud: he sent forth his lightnings and his thunders, and as he"
100,16,492,shook his aegis he gave victory to the Trojans and routed the
100,16,493,Achaeans.
100,16,494,"The panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping"
100,16,495,his face turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear
100,16,496,on the upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas
100,16,497,"had grazed the top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him"
100,16,498,and struck him from close at hand. Then Hector in close combat
100,16,499,"struck Leitus son of noble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist,"
100,16,500,and disabled him from fighting further. He looked about him in
100,16,501,"dismay, knowing that never again should he wield spear in battle"
100,16,502,"with the Trojans. While Hector was in pursuit of Leitus,"
100,16,503,Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate over his chest near the
100,16,504,"nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and the Trojans cheered"
100,16,505,aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son of Deucalion as he was
100,16,506,"standing on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, but the"
100,16,507,"spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer of Meriones who had"
100,16,508,come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left the ships on foot
100,16,509,and would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans if
100,16,510,"Coiranus had not driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought"
100,16,511,"life and rescue to Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of"
100,16,512,murderous Hector. For Hector hit him on the jaw under the ear;
100,16,513,the end of the spear drove out his teeth and cut his tongue in
100,16,514,"two pieces, so that he fell from his chariot and let the reins"
100,16,515,fall to the ground. Meriones gathered them up from the ground and
100,16,516,"took them into his own hands, then he said to Idomeneus, “Lay on,"
100,16,517,"till you get back to the ships, for you must see that the day is"
100,16,518,no longer ours.”
100,16,519,"On this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had"
100,16,520,taken hold upon him.
100,16,521,Ajax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour
100,16,522,"of the Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. “Alas,” said he,"
100,16,523,“even a fool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All
100,16,524,their weapons strike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or
100,16,525,"a coward that hurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours"
100,16,526,"fall each one of them without effect. What, then, will be best"
100,16,527,"both as regards rescuing the body, and our return to the joy of"
100,16,528,our friends who will be grieving as they look hitherwards; for
100,16,529,they will make sure that nothing can now check the terrible hands
100,16,530,"of Hector, and that he will fling himself upon our ships. I wish"
100,16,531,"that some one would go and tell the son of Peleus at once, for I"
100,16,532,do not think he can have yet heard the sad news that the dearest
100,16,533,of his friends has fallen. But I can see not a man among the
100,16,534,"Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike hidden in"
100,16,535,"darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from over the sons of"
100,16,536,"the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you will"
100,16,537,"that we perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.”"
100,16,538,Father Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears.
100,16,539,"Forthwith he chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun"
100,16,540,shone out and all the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to
100,16,541,"Menelaus, “Look, Menelaus, and if Antilochus son of Nestor be"
100,16,542,"still living, send him at once to tell Achilles that by far the"
100,16,543,dearest to him of all his comrades has fallen.”
100,16,544,Menelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a
100,16,545,"stockyard — the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who"
100,16,546,keep watch the whole night through and will not let him feast on
100,16,547,the fat of their herd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at
100,16,548,"them but in vain, for darts from strong hands assail him, and"
100,16,549,"burning brands which daunt him for all his hunger, so in the"
100,16,550,morning he slinks sulkily away — even so did Menelaus sorely
100,16,551,"against his will leave Patroclus, in great fear lest the Achaeans"
100,16,552,should be driven back in rout and let him fall into the hands of
100,16,553,"the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes straitly saying,"
100,16,554,"“Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, now indeed remember"
100,16,555,"how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous while alive, bear"
100,16,556,it in mind now that he is dead.”
100,16,557,"With this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an"
100,16,558,"eagle, whose sight they say is keener than that of any other"
100,16,559,"bird — however high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs"
100,16,560,"can escape him by crouching under bush or thicket, for he will"
100,16,561,"swoop down upon it and make an end of it — even so, O Menelaus, did"
100,16,562,your keen eyes range round the mighty host of your followers to
100,16,563,see if you could find the son of Nestor still alive. Presently
100,16,564,Menelaus saw him on the extreme left of the battle cheering on
100,16,565,his men and exhorting them to fight boldly. Menelaus went up to
100,16,566,"him and said, “Antilochus, come here and listen to sad news,"
100,16,567,which I would indeed were untrue. You must see with your own eyes
100,16,568,"that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans, and giving"
100,16,569,"victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was the bravest"
100,16,570,"of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Run"
100,16,571,"instantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to"
100,16,572,"rescue the body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour,"
100,16,573,Hector already has it.”
100,16,574,Antilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was
100,16,575,speechless; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no
100,16,576,"utterance, but he did as Menelaus had said, and set off running"
100,16,577,"as soon as he had given his armour to a comrade, Laodocus, who"
100,16,578,"was wheeling his horses round, close beside him."
100,16,579,"Thus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad"
100,16,580,"news to Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded"
100,16,581,"to succour his harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the"
100,16,582,Pylians — and greatly did they miss him — but he sent them noble
100,16,583,"Thrasymedes, and himself went back to Patroclus. He came running"
100,16,584,"up to the two Ajaxes and said, “I have sent Antilochus to the"
100,16,585,"ships to tell Achilles, but rage against Hector as he may, he"
100,16,586,"cannot come, for he cannot fight without armour. What then will"
100,16,587,"be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead, and our own"
100,16,588,escape from death amid the battle - cries of the Trojans?”
100,16,589,"Ajax answered, “Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and"
100,16,590,"Meriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray,"
100,16,591,"while we two behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in"
100,16,592,"heart as in name, and long used to fighting side by side with one"
100,16,593,another.”
100,16,594,On this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and
100,16,595,lifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised
100,16,596,a hue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the
100,16,597,"body away, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded"
100,16,598,boar at the loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the
100,16,599,"hounds fly at him as though they would tear him in pieces, but"
100,16,600,"now and again he turns on them in a fury, scaring and scattering"
100,16,601,them in all directions — even so did the Trojans for a while charge
100,16,602,"in a body, striking with sword and with spears pointed at both"
100,16,603,"the ends, but when the two Ajaxes faced them and stood at bay,"
100,16,604,they would turn pale and no man dared press on to fight further
100,16,605,about the dead.
100,16,606,In this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the
100,16,607,body to the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them
100,16,608,like fierce flames that when once kindled spread like wildfire
100,16,609,"over a city, and the houses fall in the glare of its burning — even"
100,16,610,such was the roar and tramp of men and horses that pursued them
100,16,611,as they bore Patroclus from the field. Or as mules that put forth
100,16,612,all their strength to draw some beam or great piece of ship’s
100,16,613,"timber down a rough mountain - track, and they pant and sweat as"
100,16,614,they go — even so did Menelaus and Meriones pant and sweat as they bore the
100,16,615,body of Patroclus. Behind them the two Ajaxes held stoutly out.
100,16,616,As some wooded mountain - spur that stretches across a plain will
100,16,617,"turn water and check the flow even of a great river, nor is there"
100,16,618,any stream strong enough to break through it — even so did the two
100,16,619,Ajaxes face the Trojans and stem the tide of their fighting
100,16,620,though they kept pouring on towards them and foremost among them
100,16,621,all was Aeneas son of Anchises with valiant Hector. As a flock of
100,16,622,daws or starlings fall to screaming and chattering when they see
100,16,623,"a falcon, foe to all small birds, come soaring near them, even so"
100,16,624,did the Achaean youth raise a babel of cries as they fled before
100,16,625,"Aeneas and Hector, unmindful of their former prowess. In the rout"
100,16,626,"of the Danaans much goodly armour fell round about the trench,"
100,16,627,and of fighting there was no end.
100,17,1,The grief of Achilles over Patroclus — The visit of Thetis to
100,17,2,Vulcan and the armour that he made for Achilles.
100,17,3,Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the
100,17,4,"fleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached"
100,17,5,"Achilles, and found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that"
100,17,6,"which was indeed too surely true. “Alas,” said he to himself in"
100,17,7,"the heaviness of his heart, “why are the Achaeans again scouring"
100,17,8,the plain and flocking towards the ships? Heaven grant the gods
100,17,9,be not now bringing that sorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis
100,17,10,"spoke, saying that while I was yet alive the bravest of the"
100,17,11,"Myrmidons should fall before the Trojans, and see the light of"
100,17,12,the sun no longer. I fear the brave son of Menoetius has fallen
100,17,13,through his own daring and yet I bade him return to the ships as
100,17,14,soon as he had driven back those that were bringing fire against
100,17,15,"them, and not join battle with Hector.”"
100,17,16,"As he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and"
100,17,17,"told his sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. “Alas,” he cried,"
100,17,18,"“son of noble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that"
100,17,19,"they were untrue. Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging"
100,17,20,about his naked body — for Hector holds his armour.”
100,17,21,A dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He
100,17,22,"filled both hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it"
100,17,23,"over his head, disfiguring his comely face, and letting the"
100,17,24,refuse settle over his shirt so fair and new. He flung himself
100,17,25,"down all huge and hugely at full length, and tore his hair with"
100,17,26,his hands. The bondswomen whom Achilles and Patroclus had taken
100,17,27,"captive screamed aloud for grief, beating their breasts, and with"
100,17,28,their limbs failing them for sorrow. Antilochus bent over him the
100,17,29,"while, weeping and holding both his hands as he lay groaning for"
100,17,30,he feared that he might plunge a knife into his own throat. Then
100,17,31,Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard him as she was
100,17,32,"sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father,"
100,17,33,"whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus"
100,17,34,"that dwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her."
100,17,35,"There were Glauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, Thoe and"
100,17,36,"dark - eyed Halie, Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera,"
100,17,37,"Amphithoe and Agave, Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene,"
100,17,38,"Dexamene, Amphinome and Callianeira, Doris, Panope, and the"
100,17,39,"famous sea - nymph Galatea, Nemertes, Apseudes and Callianassa."
100,17,40,"There were also Clymene, Ianeira and Ianassa, Maera, Oreithuia"
100,17,41,"and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids who dwell in"
100,17,42,the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was filled with their
100,17,43,multitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them
100,17,44,in their lament.
100,17,45,"“Listen,” she cried, “sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may"
100,17,46,"hear the burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I"
100,17,47,have borne the most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and
100,17,48,"strong, hero among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended"
100,17,49,"him as a plant in a goodly garden, and sent him with his ships to"
100,17,50,"Ilius to fight the Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to"
100,17,51,the house of Peleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light
100,17,52,"of the sun he is in heaviness, and though I go to him I cannot"
100,17,53,"help him. Nevertheless I will go, that I may see my dear son and"
100,17,54,learn what sorrow has befallen him though he is still holding
100,17,55,aloof from battle.”
100,17,56,"She left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping"
100,17,57,"after, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached"
100,17,58,"the rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long"
100,17,59,"line on to the sands, at the place where the ships of the"
100,17,60,Myrmidons were drawn up in close order round the tents of
100,17,61,Achilles. His mother went up to him as he lay groaning; she laid
100,17,62,"her hand upon his head and spoke piteously, saying, “My son, why"
100,17,63,are you thus weeping? What sorrow has now befallen you? Tell me;
100,17,64,hide it not from me. Surely Jove has granted you the prayer you
100,17,65,"made him, when you lifted up your hands and besought him that the"
100,17,66,"Achaeans might all of them be pent up at their ships, and rue it"
100,17,67,bitterly in that you were no longer with them.”
100,17,68,"Achilles groaned and answered, “Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed"
100,17,69,"vouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to"
100,17,70,"me, seeing that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen — he whom I"
100,17,71,"valued more than all others, and loved as dearly as my own life?"
100,17,72,"I have lost him; aye, and Hector when he had killed him stripped"
100,17,73,"the wondrous armour, so glorious to behold, which the gods gave"
100,17,74,to Peleus when they laid you in the couch of a mortal man. Would
100,17,75,"that you were still dwelling among the immortal sea - nymphs, and"
100,17,76,that Peleus had taken to himself some mortal bride. For now you
100,17,77,shall have grief infinite by reason of the death of that son whom
100,17,78,"you can never welcome home — nay, I will not live nor go about"
100,17,79,"among mankind unless Hector fall by my spear, and thus pay me for"
100,17,80,having slain Patroclus son of Menoetius.”
100,17,81,"Thetis wept and answered, “Then, my son, is your end near at"
100,17,82,hand — for your own death awaits you full soon after that of
100,17,83,Hector.”
100,17,84,"Then said Achilles in his great grief, “I would die here and now,"
100,17,85,"in that I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home,"
100,17,86,and in his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What
100,17,87,"is there for me? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have"
100,17,88,brought no saving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades
100,17,89,of whom so many have been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by
100,17,90,"my ships a bootless burden upon the earth, I, who in fight have"
100,17,91,"no peer among the Achaeans, though in council there are better"
100,17,92,"than I. Therefore, perish strife both from among gods and men,"
100,17,93,"and anger, wherein even a righteous man will harden his"
100,17,94,"heart — which rises up in the soul of a man like smoke, and the"
100,17,95,taste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey. Even so has
100,17,96,"Agamemnon angered me. And yet — so be it, for it is over; I will"
100,17,97,force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will
100,17,98,"pursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will"
100,17,99,then abide my doom when it may please Jove and the other gods to
100,17,100,"send it. Even Hercules, the best beloved of Jove — even he could"
100,17,101,"not escape the hand of death, but fate and Juno’s fierce anger"
100,17,102,"laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom"
100,17,103,"awaits me. Till then I will win fame, and will bid Trojan and"
100,17,104,Dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both
100,17,105,their hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall
100,17,106,they know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no
100,17,107,"longer. Hold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for"
100,17,108,you shall not move me.”
100,17,109,"Then silver - footed Thetis answered, “My son, what you have said"
100,17,110,"is true. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but"
100,17,111,your armour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in
100,17,112,triumph upon his own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt
100,17,113,"shall not be lasting, for his end is close at hand; go not,"
100,17,114,"however, into the press of battle till you see me return hither;"
100,17,115,"to - morrow at break of day I shall be here, and will bring you"
100,17,116,goodly armour from King Vulcan.”
100,17,117,"On this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said"
100,17,118,"to the sea - nymphs her sisters, “Dive into the bosom of the sea"
100,17,119,and go to the house of the old sea - god my father. Tell him
100,17,120,"everything; as for me, I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on"
100,17,121,"high Olympus, and ask him to provide my son with a suit of"
100,17,122,splendid armour.”
100,17,123,"When she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves,"
100,17,124,while silver - footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the
100,17,125,armour for her son.
100,17,126,"Thus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and"
100,17,127,meanwhile the Achaeans were flying with loud cries before
100,17,128,"murderous Hector till they reached the ships and the Hellespont,"
100,17,129,and they could not draw the body of Mars’s servant Patroclus out
100,17,130,"of reach of the weapons that were showered upon him, for Hector"
100,17,131,son of Priam with his host and horsemen had again caught up to
100,17,132,him like the flame of a fiery furnace; thrice did brave Hector
100,17,133,"seize him by the feet, striving with might and main to draw him"
100,17,134,"away and calling loudly on the Trojans, and thrice did the two"
100,17,135,"Ajaxes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him from off"
100,17,136,the body; but all undaunted he would now charge into the thick of
100,17,137,"the fight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud, but"
100,17,138,he would give no ground. As upland shepherds that cannot chase
100,17,139,"some famished lion from a carcase, even so could not the two"
100,17,140,Ajaxes scare Hector son of Priam from the body of Patroclus.
100,17,141,And now he would even have dragged it off and have won
100,17,142,"imperishable glory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her"
100,17,143,way as messenger from Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him
100,17,144,arm. She came secretly without the knowledge of Jove and of the
100,17,145,"other gods, for Juno sent her, and when she had got close to him"
100,17,146,"she said, “Up, son of Peleus, mightiest of all mankind; rescue"
100,17,147,Patroclus about whom this fearful fight is now raging by the
100,17,148,"ships. Men are killing one another, the Danaans in defence of the"
100,17,149,"dead body, while the Trojans are trying to hale it away, and take"
100,17,150,it to windy Ilius: Hector is the most furious of them all; he is
100,17,151,for cutting the head from the body and fixing it on the stakes of
100,17,152,"the wall. Up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink from the"
100,17,153,thought that Patroclus may become meat for the dogs of Troy.
100,17,154,"Shame on you, should his body suffer any kind of outrage.”"
100,17,155,"And Achilles said, “Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you"
100,17,156,to me?”
100,17,157,"Iris answered, “It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son"
100,17,158,"of Saturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of"
100,17,159,the immortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus.”
100,17,160,"Then fleet Achilles answered her saying, “How can I go up into"
100,17,161,the battle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till
100,17,162,"I should see her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour"
100,17,163,"from Vulcan; I know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the"
100,17,164,"shield of Ajax son of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in"
100,17,165,the front rank and wielding his spear about the body of dead
100,17,166,Patroclus.”
100,17,167,"Iris said, “We know that your armour has been taken, but go as"
100,17,168,you are; go to the deep trench and show yourself before the
100,17,169,"Trojans, that they may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the"
100,17,170,"fainting sons of the Achaeans gain some brief breathing - time,"
100,17,171,which in battle may hardly be.”
100,17,172,Iris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove
100,17,173,"arose, and Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong"
100,17,174,shoulders; she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from
100,17,175,which she kindled a glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes
100,17,176,up into heaven from some city that is being beleaguered on an
100,17,177,island far out at sea — all day long do men sally from the city and
100,17,178,"fight their hardest, and at the going down of the sun the line of"
100,17,179,"beacon - fires blazes forth, flaring high for those that dwell near"
100,17,180,"them to behold, if so be that they may come with their ships and"
100,17,181,succour them — even so did the light flare from the head of
100,17,182,"Achilles, as he stood by the trench, going beyond the wall — but he"
100,17,183,did not join the Achaeans for he heeded the charge which his
100,17,184,mother laid upon him.
100,17,185,There did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice
100,17,186,"from afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans."
100,17,187,Ringing as the note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe
100,17,188,"is at the gates of a city, even so brazen was the voice of the"
100,17,189,"son of Aeacus, and when the Trojans heard its clarion tones they"
100,17,190,were dismayed; the horses turned back with their chariots for
100,17,191,"they boded mischief, and their drivers were awe - struck by the"
100,17,192,steady flame which the grey - eyed goddess had kindled above the
100,17,193,head of the great son of Peleus.
100,17,194,"Thrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,"
100,17,195,and thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into
100,17,196,confusion; whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath
100,17,197,the wheels of their chariots and perished by their own spears.
100,17,198,The Achaeans to their great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach
100,17,199,"of the weapons, and laid him on a litter: his comrades stood"
100,17,200,"mourning round him, and among them fleet Achilles who wept"
100,17,201,bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying dead upon his bier. He
100,17,202,"had sent him out with horses and chariots into battle, but his"
100,17,203,return he was not to welcome.
100,17,204,"Then Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters"
100,17,205,"of Oceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and"
100,17,206,turmoil of war.
100,17,207,"Now the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked"
100,17,208,their horses and gathered in assembly before preparing their
100,17,209,"supper. They kept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for"
100,17,210,fear had fallen upon them all because Achilles had shown himself
100,17,211,after having held aloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of
100,17,212,"Panthous was first to speak, a man of judgement, who alone among"
100,17,213,"them could look both before and after. He was comrade to Hector,"
100,17,214,and they had been born upon the same night; with all sincerity
100,17,215,"and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus: —"
100,17,216,"“Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to"
100,17,217,"your city and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are"
100,17,218,far from our walls. So long as this man was at enmity with
100,17,219,"Agamemnon the Achaeans were easier to deal with, and I would have"
100,17,220,gladly camped by the ships in the hope of taking them; but now I
100,17,221,go in great fear of the fleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that
100,17,222,he will never bide here on the plain whereon the Trojans and
100,17,223,"Achaeans fight with equal valour, but he will try to storm our"
100,17,224,"city and carry off our women. Do then as I say, and let us"
100,17,225,retreat. For this is what will happen. The darkness of night will
100,17,226,"for a time stay the son of Peleus, but if he find us here in the"
100,17,227,"morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall have"
100,17,228,knowledge of him in good earnest. Glad indeed will he be who can
100,17,229,"escape and get back to Ilius, and many a Trojan will become meat"
100,17,230,for dogs and vultures may I never live to hear it. If we do as I
100,17,231,"say, little though we may like it, we shall have strength in"
100,17,232,"counsel during the night, and the great gates with the doors that"
100,17,233,close them will protect the city. At dawn we can arm and take our
100,17,234,stand on the walls; he will then rue it if he sallies from the
100,17,235,ships to fight us. He will go back when he has given his horses
100,17,236,"their fill of being driven all whithers under our walls, and will"
100,17,237,be in no mind to try and force his way into the city. Neither
100,17,238,"will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so.”"
100,17,239,"Hector looked fiercely at him and answered, “Polydamas, your"
100,17,240,words are not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent
100,17,241,within the city. Have you not had enough of being cooped up
100,17,242,behind walls? In the old - days the city of Priam was famous the
100,17,243,"whole world over for its wealth of gold and bronze, but our"
100,17,244,"treasures are wasted out of our houses, and much goods have been"
100,17,245,"sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia, for the hand of Jove has"
100,17,246,"been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore, that the son of"
100,17,247,scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here and to hem
100,17,248,"the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this fool’s wise"
100,17,249,among the people. You will have no man with you; it shall not be;
100,17,250,do all of you as I now say; — take your suppers in your companies
100,17,251,"throughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful every"
100,17,252,"man of you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let"
100,17,253,him gather them and give them out among the people. Better let
100,17,254,"these, rather than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will"
100,17,255,arm and fight about the ships; granted that Achilles has again
100,17,256,"come forward to defend them, let it be as he will, but it shall"
100,17,257,"go hard with him. I shall not shun him, but will fight him, to"
100,17,258,"fall or conquer. The god of war deals out like measure to all,"
100,17,259,and the slayer may yet be slain.”
100,17,260,"Thus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted"
100,17,261,"in applause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their"
100,17,262,"understanding. They gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but"
100,17,263,the wise words of Polydamas no man would heed. They took their
100,17,264,"supper throughout the host, and meanwhile through the whole night"
100,17,265,"the Achaeans mourned Patroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in"
100,17,266,their lament. He laid his murderous hands upon the breast of his
100,17,267,"comrade, groaning again and again as a bearded lion when a man"
100,17,268,who was chasing deer has robbed him of his young in some dense
100,17,269,"forest; when the lion comes back he is furious, and searches"
100,17,270,"dingle and dell to track the hunter if he can find him, for he is"
100,17,271,mad with rage — even so with many a sigh did Achilles speak among
100,17,272,"the Myrmidons saying, “Alas! vain were the words with which I"
100,17,273,cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said that I would
100,17,274,bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked
100,17,275,Ilius and taken his share of the spoils — but Jove does not give
100,17,276,all men their heart’s desire. The same soil shall be reddened
100,17,277,"here at Troy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be"
100,17,278,"welcomed home by the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis,"
100,17,279,"but even in this place shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O"
100,17,280,"Patroclus, now that I am left behind you, I will not bury you,"
100,17,281,till I have brought hither the head and armour of mighty Hector
100,17,282,who has slain you. Twelve noble sons of Trojans will I behead
100,17,283,before your bier to avenge you; till I have done so you shall lie
100,17,284,"as you are by the ships, and fair women of Troy and Dardanus,"
100,17,285,whom we have taken with spear and strength of arm when we sacked
100,17,286,"men’s goodly cities, shall weep over you both night and day.”"
100,17,287,Then Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire
100,17,288,that they might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon
100,17,289,they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they
100,17,290,"threw sticks on to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot"
100,17,291,as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. When the water
100,17,292,"in the cauldron was boiling they washed the body, anointed it"
100,17,293,"with oil, and closed its wounds with ointment that had been kept"
100,17,294,nine years. Then they laid it on a bier and covered it with a
100,17,295,"linen cloth from head to foot, and over this they laid a fair"
100,17,296,white robe. Thus all night long did the Myrmidons gather round
100,17,297,Achilles to mourn Patroclus.
100,17,298,"Then Jove said to Juno his sister - wife, “So, Queen Juno, you have"
100,17,299,"gained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think"
100,17,300,that the Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.”
100,17,301,"And Juno answered, “Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this"
100,17,302,thing? May not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than
100,17,303,"we do, do what he can for another person? And shall not"
100,17,304,I — foremost of all goddesses both by descent and as wife to you
100,17,305,who reign in heaven — devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry
100,17,306,with them?”
100,17,307,Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of
100,17,308,"Vulcan, imperishable, star - bespangled, fairest of the abodes in"
100,17,309,"heaven, a house of bronze wrought by the lame god’s own hands."
100,17,310,"She found him busy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work,"
100,17,311,for he was making twenty tripods that were to stand by the wall
100,17,312,"of his house, and he set wheels of gold under them all that they"
100,17,313,"might go of their own selves to the assemblies of the gods, and"
100,17,314,come back again — marvels indeed to see. They were finished all but
100,17,315,the ears of cunning workmanship which yet remained to be fixed to
100,17,316,"them: these he was now fixing, and he was hammering at the"
100,17,317,rivets. While he was thus at work silver - footed Thetis came to
100,17,318,"the house. Charis, of graceful head - dress, wife to the far - famed"
100,17,319,"lame god, came towards her as soon as she saw her, and took her"
100,17,320,"hand in her own, saying, “Why have you come to our house, Thetis,"
100,17,321,honoured and ever welcome — for you do not visit us often? Come
100,17,322,inside and let me set refreshment before you.”
100,17,323,"The goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a"
100,17,324,richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool
100,17,325,"also under her feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, “Vulcan,"
100,17,326,"come here, Thetis wants you”; and the far - famed lame god"
100,17,327,"answered, “Then it is indeed an august and honoured goddess who"
100,17,328,has come here; she it was that took care of me when I was
100,17,329,suffering from the heavy fall which I had through my cruel
100,17,330,mother’s anger — for she would have got rid of me because I was
100,17,331,"lame. It would have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome,"
100,17,332,"daughter of the ever - encircling waters of Oceanus, and Thetis,"
100,17,333,"taken me to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them, and"
100,17,334,"many beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups,"
100,17,335,"and chains, did I make for them in their cave, with the roaring"
100,17,336,waters of Oceanus foaming as they rushed ever past it; and no one
100,17,337,"knew, neither of gods nor men, save only Thetis and Eurynome who"
100,17,338,"took care of me. If, then, Thetis has come to my house I must"
100,17,339,"make her due requital for having saved me; entertain her,"
100,17,340,"therefore, with all hospitality, while I put by my bellows and"
100,17,341,all my tools.”
100,17,342,"On this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin"
100,17,343,legs plying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the
100,17,344,"fire, and gathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a"
100,17,345,"sponge and washed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny"
100,17,346,"neck; he donned his shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped"
100,17,347,towards the door. There were golden handmaids also who worked for
200,1,1,ASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA — SPEECHES OF TELEMACHUS AND OF THE
200,1,2,SUITORS — TELEMACHUS MAKES HIS PREPARATIONS AND STARTS FOR PYLOS WITH
200,1,3,MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.
200,1,4,"Now when the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared Telemachus"
200,1,5,"rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,"
200,1,6,"girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an"
200,1,7,immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in
200,1,8,"assembly, so they called them and the people gathered thereon; then,"
200,1,9,"when they were got together, he went to the place of assembly spear in"
200,1,10,"hand — not alone, for his two hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him"
200,1,11,with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as
200,1,12,"he went by, and when he took his place in his father’s seat even the"
200,1,13,oldest councillors made way for him.
200,1,14,"Aegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, was"
200,1,15,"the first to speak. His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius,"
200,1,16,"land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they"
200,1,17,"were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him.17"
200,1,18,"He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father’s"
200,1,19,"land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless"
200,1,20,"their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still"
200,1,21,weeping for him when he began his speech.
200,1,22,"“Men of Ithaca,” he said, “hear my words. From the day Ulysses left us"
200,1,23,there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then can it
200,1,24,"be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene us? Has"
200,1,25,"he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or"
200,1,26,would he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure he is
200,1,27,"an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart’s"
200,1,28,desire.”
200,1,29,"Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he"
200,1,30,was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the
200,1,31,"assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,"
200,1,32,"turning to Aegyptius, “Sir,” said he, “it is I, as you will shortly"
200,1,33,"learn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I"
200,1,34,"have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you,"
200,1,35,nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My
200,1,36,"grievance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which"
200,1,37,have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my
200,1,38,"excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and was"
200,1,39,"like a father to every one of you; the second is much more serious, and"
200,1,40,ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief
200,1,41,men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will.
200,1,42,"They are afraid to go to her father Icarius, asking him to choose the"
200,1,43,"one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but"
200,1,44,"day by day they keep hanging about my father’s house, sacrificing our"
200,1,45,"oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much"
200,1,46,as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand
200,1,47,such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our
200,1,48,"doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days"
200,1,49,"be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had"
200,1,50,"power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house"
200,1,51,"is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own"
200,1,52,"consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest"
200,1,53,the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and
200,1,54,"Themis, who is the beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold"
200,1,55,"back, my friends, and leave me singlehanded18 — unless it be that my"
200,1,56,brave father Ulysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now
200,1,57,"avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am"
200,1,58,"to be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the"
200,1,59,"eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some"
200,1,60,"purpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I got paid"
200,1,61,"in full, whereas now I have no remedy.”19"
200,1,62,With this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into
200,1,63,"tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no"
200,1,64,"one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke"
200,1,65,thus:
200,1,66,"“Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw"
200,1,67,"the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother’s fault not ours, for she"
200,1,68,"is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she"
200,1,69,"had been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us,"
200,1,70,and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And
200,1,71,then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great
200,1,72,"tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of"
200,1,73,"fine needlework. ‘Sweet hearts,’ said she, ‘Ulysses is indeed dead,"
200,1,74,"still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait — for I would not"
200,1,75,have skill in needlework perish unrecorded — till I have completed a pall
200,1,76,"for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against the time when death"
200,1,77,"shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk"
200,1,78,if he is laid out without a pall.’
200,1,79,"“This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her"
200,1,80,"working on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick"
200,1,81,the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three
200,1,82,"years and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was now"
200,1,83,"in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told"
200,1,84,"us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to"
200,1,85,"finish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you"
200,1,86,"this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand — ‘Send your"
200,1,87,"mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father’s"
200,1,88,choice’; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us
200,1,89,much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the
200,1,90,"accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is so clever."
200,1,91,"We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena,"
200,1,92,"Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing to your"
200,1,93,"mother any one of them. It was not fair of her to treat us in that way,"
200,1,94,and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven has now
200,1,95,"endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your estate; and I do not"
200,1,96,"see why she should change, for she gets all the honour and glory, and"
200,1,97,"it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that we will not"
200,1,98,"go back to our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made her"
200,1,99,choice and married some one or other of us.”
200,1,100,"Telemachus answered, “Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore me"
200,1,101,from my father’s house? My father is abroad and we do not know whether
200,1,102,he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the
200,1,103,large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter
200,1,104,"back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will"
200,1,105,also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will call on
200,1,106,"the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be a creditable thing"
200,1,107,"to do, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you choose to take"
200,1,108,"offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another’s"
200,1,109,"houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand, you"
200,1,110,"elect to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove"
200,1,111,"shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father’s house"
200,1,112,there shall be no man to avenge you.”
200,1,113,"As he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they"
200,1,114,"flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly"
200,1,115,flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they
200,1,116,"wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring"
200,1,117,"death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting fiercely"
200,1,118,"and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the"
200,1,119,"town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what"
200,1,120,"all this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best prophet and"
200,1,121,"reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all honesty,"
200,1,122,saying:
200,1,123,"“Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors,"
200,1,124,for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away
200,1,125,much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and
200,1,126,"destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who live in"
200,1,127,"Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness"
200,1,128,before he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be
200,1,129,"better for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge;"
200,1,130,everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set
200,1,131,"out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through much"
200,1,132,hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the
200,1,133,twentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this is
200,1,134,coming true.”
200,1,135,"Eurymachus son of Polybus then said, “Go home, old man, and prophesy to"
200,1,136,"your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens"
200,1,137,myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the
200,1,138,"sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has"
200,1,139,"died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with"
200,1,140,"him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger"
200,1,141,of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he
200,1,142,"will give you something for your family, but I tell you — and it shall"
200,1,143,"surely be — when an old man like you, who should know better, talks a"
200,1,144,"young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his"
200,1,145,young friend will only fare so much the worse — he will take nothing by
200,1,146,"it, for the suitors will prevent this — and in the next, we will lay a"
200,1,147,"heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for"
200,1,148,"it will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the"
200,1,149,"presence of you all to send his mother back to her father, who will"
200,1,150,find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear
200,1,151,a daughter may expect. Till then we shall go on harassing him with our
200,1,152,"suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with all his fine"
200,1,153,"speeches, nor for any fortune - telling of yours. You may preach as much"
200,1,154,"as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back"
200,1,155,"and continue to eat up Telemachus’s estate without paying him, till"
200,1,156,such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day
200,1,157,"after day on the tiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in"
200,1,158,his suit for a prize of such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go
200,1,159,"after the other women whom we should marry in due course, but for the"
200,1,160,way in which she treats us.”
200,1,161,"Then Telemachus said, “Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say"
200,1,162,"no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of"
200,1,163,"Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty"
200,1,164,"men to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos"
200,1,165,in quest of my father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell
200,1,166,"me something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some"
200,1,167,heaven - sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on
200,1,168,his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet
200,1,169,"another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will"
200,1,170,"return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a"
200,1,171,"barrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.”"
200,1,172,"With these words he sat down, and Mentor20 who had been a friend of"
200,1,173,"Ulysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority"
200,1,174,"over the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty"
200,1,175,addressed them thus:
200,1,176,"“Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and"
200,1,177,"well - disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I"
200,1,178,"hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for"
200,1,179,"there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as"
200,1,180,"though he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors,"
200,1,181,"for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts,"
200,1,182,"and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the"
200,1,183,"high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at"
200,1,184,the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop such
200,1,185,"scandalous goings on — which you could do if you chose, for you are many"
200,1,186,and they are few.”
200,1,187,"Leiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, “Mentor, what folly is"
200,1,188,"all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing"
200,1,189,for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses
200,1,190,"himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do"
200,1,191,"his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly, would"
200,1,192,"have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own"
200,1,193,head if he fought against such great odds. There is no sense in what
200,1,194,"you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about your"
200,1,195,"business, and let his father’s old friends, Mentor and Halitherses,"
200,1,196,"speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all — which I do not think"
200,1,197,"he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes"
200,1,198,and tells him something.”
200,1,199,"On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own"
200,1,200,"abode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses."
200,1,201,"Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the"
200,1,202,"grey waves, and prayed to Minerva."
200,1,203,"“Hear me,” he cried, “you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me"
200,1,204,sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I
200,1,205,"would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked"
200,1,206,"suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so.”"
200,1,207,"As he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and"
200,1,208,"with the voice of Mentor. “Telemachus,” said she, “if you are made of"
200,1,209,the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward
200,1,210,"henceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half"
200,1,211,"done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,"
200,1,212,but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins
200,1,213,I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as
200,1,214,"their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as you are"
200,1,215,"not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not"
200,1,216,"entirely without some share of your father’s wise discernment, I look"
200,1,217,with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause
200,1,218,"with any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor"
200,1,219,"virtue, and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortly"
200,1,220,"fall on one and all of them, so that they shall perish on the same day."
200,1,221,"As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was such"
200,1,222,"an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with"
200,1,223,"you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about among the suitors;"
200,1,224,begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well
200,1,225,"stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of"
200,1,226,"life, in leathern bags, while I go round the town and beat up"
200,1,227,volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I
200,1,228,will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get
200,1,229,her ready and will put out to sea without delay.”
200,1,230,"Thus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in"
200,1,231,"doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the"
200,1,232,suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous
200,1,233,"came up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,"
200,1,234,"saying, “Telemachus, my fine fire - eater, bear no more ill blood neither"
200,1,235,"in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The"
200,1,236,Achaeans will find you in everything — a ship and a picked crew to
200,1,237,boot — so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your
200,1,238,noble father.”
200,1,239,"“Antinous,” answered Telemachus, “I cannot eat in peace, nor take"
200,1,240,pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that
200,1,241,you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?
200,1,242,"Now that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and"
200,1,243,"whether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do you all"
200,1,244,"the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain — though,"
200,1,245,"thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must"
200,1,246,be passenger not captain.”
200,1,247,As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the
200,1,248,"others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings,21 jeering at"
200,1,249,him tauntingly as they did so.
200,1,250,"“Telemachus,” said one youngster, “means to be the death of us; I"
200,1,251,"suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again"
200,1,252,"from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as"
200,1,253,"well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?”"
200,1,254,"Another said, “Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be"
200,1,255,like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should
200,1,256,"have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us:"
200,1,257,as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries her have
200,1,258,that.”
200,1,259,This was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and
200,1,260,spacious store - room where his father’s treasure of gold and bronze lay
200,1,261,"heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were"
200,1,262,"kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive"
200,1,263,"oil, while casks of old, well - ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god"
200,1,264,"to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home"
200,1,265,again after all. The room was closed with well - made doors opening in
200,1,266,"the middle; moreover the faithful old house - keeper Euryclea, daughter"
200,1,267,"of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and"
200,1,268,day. Telemachus called her to the store - room and said:
200,1,269,"“Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are"
200,1,270,"keeping for my father’s own drinking, in case, poor man, he should"
200,1,271,"escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve"
200,1,272,"jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well - sewn"
200,1,273,leathern bags with barley meal — about twenty measures in all. Get these
200,1,274,"things put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take"
200,1,275,everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for
200,1,276,the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear
200,1,277,anything about the return of my dear father.”
200,1,278,"When Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him,"
200,1,279,"saying, “My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into"
200,1,280,"your head? Where in the world do you want to go to — you, who are the one"
200,1,281,hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign
200,1,282,"country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these"
200,1,283,"wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way, and"
200,1,284,will share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are
200,1,285,"among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your life"
200,1,286,out on the barren ocean.”
200,1,287,"“Fear not, nurse,” answered Telemachus, “my scheme is not without"
200,1,288,heaven’s sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this
200,1,289,"to my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she"
200,1,290,"hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to spoil"
200,1,291,her beauty by crying.”
200,1,292,"The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had"
200,1,293,"completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and"
200,1,294,"getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to"
200,1,295,the suitors.
200,1,296,"Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and"
200,1,297,"went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at"
200,1,298,"the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked"
200,1,299,him to let her have a ship — which he was very ready to do. When the sun
200,1,300,"had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship into the"
200,1,301,"water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and"
200,1,302,"stationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the crew came up,"
200,1,303,and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.
200,1,304,"Furthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors"
200,1,305,"into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made"
200,1,306,"them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting over"
200,1,307,"their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their eyes"
200,1,308,heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of
200,1,309,"Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside."
200,1,310,"“Telemachus,” said she, “the men are on board and at their oars,"
200,1,311,"waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.”"
200,1,312,"On this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When"
200,1,313,"they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side, and"
200,1,314,"Telemachus said, “Now my men, help me to get the stores on board; they"
200,1,315,"are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not know"
200,1,316,"anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.”"
200,1,317,With these words he led the way and the others followed after. When
200,1,318,"they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,"
200,1,319,Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the
200,1,320,"vessel, while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the"
200,1,321,hawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair
200,1,322,"wind from the West,22 that whistled over the deep blue waves23 whereon"
200,1,323,"Telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and"
200,1,324,they did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross
200,1,325,"plank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they"
200,1,326,hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the
200,1,327,"sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue"
200,1,328,"water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then"
200,1,329,"they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing bowls to the"
200,1,330,"brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from"
200,1,331,"everlasting, but more particularly to the grey - eyed daughter of Jove."
200,1,332,"Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night"
200,1,333,"from dark till dawn,"
200,2,1,TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.
200,2,2,but as the sun was rising from the fair sea24 into the firmament of
200,2,3,"heaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the"
200,2,4,city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore
200,2,5,to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.
200,2,6,"There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were"
200,2,7,nine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats25 and
200,2,8,"burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune,"
200,2,9,"Telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship"
200,2,10,"to anchor, and went ashore."
200,2,11,"Minerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,"
200,2,12,"“Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have"
200,2,13,taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and
200,2,14,how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see
200,2,15,"what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will"
200,2,16,"tell no lies, for he is an excellent person.”"
200,2,17,"“But how, Mentor,” replied Telemachus, “dare I go up to Nestor, and how"
200,2,18,am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long
200,2,19,"conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one who"
200,2,20,is so much older than myself.”
200,2,21,"“Some things, Telemachus,” answered Minerva, “will be suggested to you"
200,2,22,"by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I am"
200,2,23,assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth
200,2,24,until now.”
200,2,25,"She then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till"
200,2,26,they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were
200,2,27,"assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his"
200,2,28,"company round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of"
200,2,29,meat on to the spits26 while other pieces were cooking. When they saw
200,2,30,"the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade"
200,2,31,them take their places. Nestor’s son Pisistratus at once offered his
200,2,32,"hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were"
200,2,33,lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he
200,2,34,gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them
200,2,35,"into a golden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting her at the"
200,2,36,same time.
200,2,37,"“Offer a prayer, sir,” said he, “to King Neptune, for it is his feast"
200,2,38,that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink
200,2,39,"offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt"
200,2,40,"not that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without"
200,2,41,"God in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an"
200,2,42,"age with myself, so I will give you the precedence.”"
200,2,43,As he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and
200,2,44,proper of him to have given it to herself first;27 she accordingly
200,2,45,"began praying heartily to Neptune. “O thou,” she cried, “that"
200,2,46,"encirclest the earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants"
200,2,47,that call upon thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace
200,2,48,on Nestor and on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian
200,2,49,people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering
200,2,50,"you. Lastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of"
200,2,51,the matter that has brought us in our ship to Pylos.”
200,2,52,"When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to"
200,2,53,"Telemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were"
200,2,54,"roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man"
200,2,55,his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had
200,2,56,"had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak."
200,2,57,"“Now,” said he, “that our guests have done their dinner, it will be"
200,2,58,"best to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and"
200,2,59,from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail the
200,2,60,"seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man’s hand"
200,2,61,against you?”
200,2,62,"Telemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask"
200,2,63,about his father and get himself a good name.
200,2,64,"“Nestor,” said he, “son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you ask"
200,2,65,"whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under"
200,2,66,"Neritum,28 and the matter about which I would speak is of private not"
200,2,67,"public import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said to"
200,2,68,have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what
200,2,69,"fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but as"
200,2,70,regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is
200,2,71,"dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished, nor"
200,2,72,"say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid"
200,2,73,"the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if"
200,2,74,"haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether you"
200,2,75,"saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller, for"
200,2,76,he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for
200,2,77,"me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave"
200,2,78,"father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either by word or deed, when"
200,2,79,"you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in"
200,2,80,my favour and tell me truly all.”
200,2,81,"“My friend,” answered Nestor, “you recall a time of much sorrow to my"
200,2,82,"mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while"
200,2,83,"privateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of"
200,2,84,"king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there — Ajax, Achilles,"
200,2,85,"Patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a"
200,2,86,man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much
200,2,87,more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story?
200,2,88,"Though you were to stay here and question me for five years, or even"
200,2,89,"six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would"
200,2,90,turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we
200,2,91,"try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us;"
200,2,92,during all this time there was no one who could compare with your
200,2,93,father in subtlety — if indeed you are his son — I can hardly believe my
200,2,94,eyes — and you talk just like him too — no one would say that people of
200,2,95,such different ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had any
200,2,96,"kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council, but"
200,2,97,in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might
200,2,98,be ordered for the best.
200,2,99,"“When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail"
200,2,100,"in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex the"
200,2,101,Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either wise
200,2,102,"or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the"
200,2,103,"displeasure of Jove’s daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel"
200,2,104,between the two sons of Atreus.
200,2,105,"“The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for"
200,2,106,it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they
200,2,107,"explained why they had called the people together, it seemed that"
200,2,108,"Menelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased"
200,2,109,"Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offered"
200,2,110,"hecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might"
200,2,111,"have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have"
200,2,112,made up their minds they do not change them lightly. So the two stood
200,2,113,"bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a"
200,2,114,"cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what they should do."
200,2,115,"“That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching"
200,2,116,mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into
200,2,117,"the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,"
200,2,118,"about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We — the other"
200,2,119,"half — embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had"
200,2,120,smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the
200,2,121,"gods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet"
200,2,122,"mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of"
200,2,123,"which some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away"
200,2,124,"under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the"
200,2,125,"ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was"
200,2,126,"brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with me, and his crews with"
200,2,127,"him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our"
200,2,128,minds about our course — for we did not know whether to go outside Chios
200,2,129,"by the island of Psyra, keeping this to our left, or inside Chios, over"
200,2,130,"against the stormy headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven for a sign,"
200,2,131,and were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest out of
200,2,132,danger if we headed our ships across the open sea to Euboea. This we
200,2,133,"therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage"
200,2,134,"during the night to Geraestus,29 where we offered many sacrifices to"
200,2,135,Neptune for having helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomed
200,2,136,"and his men stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos,"
200,2,137,and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it
200,2,138,fair for me.
200,2,139,"“Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything"
200,2,140,about the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were lost
200,2,141,"but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that"
200,2,142,have reached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the
200,2,143,Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles’ son Neoptolemus; so also
200,2,144,"did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no"
200,2,145,"men at sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the field got"
200,2,146,safe home with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the world you
200,2,147,"live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at"
200,2,148,the hands of Aegisthus — and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently
200,2,149,pay. See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to
200,2,150,"do as Orestes did, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble"
200,2,151,"father. You too, then — for you are a tall smart - looking fellow — show your"
200,2,152,mettle and make yourself a name in story.”
200,2,153,"“Nestor son of Neleus,” answered Telemachus, “honour to the Achaean"
200,2,154,"name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all"
200,2,155,time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant
200,2,156,"me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, who are"
200,2,157,ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no such
200,2,158,"happiness in store for me and for my father, so we must bear it as best"
200,2,159,we may.”
200,2,160,"“My friend,” said Nestor, “now that you remind me, I remember to have"
200,2,161,"heard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards"
200,2,162,"you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely,"
200,2,163,or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows
200,2,164,"but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in"
200,2,165,"full, either single - handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If"
200,2,166,Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses
200,2,167,when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so
200,2,168,"openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she"
200,2,169,"would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would"
200,2,170,soon some of them forget their wooing.”
200,2,171,"Telemachus answered, “I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far"
200,2,172,too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though
200,2,173,the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me.”
200,2,174,"On this Minerva said, “Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven"
200,2,175,"has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, I"
200,2,176,"should not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I"
200,2,177,"could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get home"
200,2,178,"quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the"
200,2,179,"treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when"
200,2,180,"a man’s hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no matter how"
200,2,181,fond they are of him.”
200,2,182,"“Mentor,” answered Telemachus, “do not let us talk about it any more."
200,2,183,There is no chance of my father’s ever coming back; the gods have long
200,2,184,"since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,"
200,2,185,"about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than"
200,2,186,any one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so
200,2,187,"that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and"
200,2,188,tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What was
200,2,189,Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better a
200,2,190,"man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging"
200,2,191,"elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed"
200,2,192,Agamemnon?”
200,2,193,"“I will tell you truly,” answered Nestor, “and indeed you have yourself"
200,2,194,divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had
200,2,195,"found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no"
200,2,196,"barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have"
200,2,197,"been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a woman"
200,2,198,"would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but"
200,2,199,"we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus, who was"
200,2,200,"taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon’s wife"
200,2,201,Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.
200,2,202,"“At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she"
200,2,203,was of a good natural disposition;30 moreover there was a bard with
200,2,204,"her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy,"
200,2,205,that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled
200,2,206,"her destruction, Aegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and"
200,2,207,left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon — after which she
200,2,208,went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many
200,2,209,"burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples with"
200,2,210,"tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his"
200,2,211,expectations.
200,2,212,"“Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms"
200,2,213,"with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens,"
200,2,214,Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of
200,2,215,Menelaus’ ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in
200,2,216,rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in his
200,2,217,"hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had to wait"
200,2,218,in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites.
200,2,219,"Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far"
200,2,220,"as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow"
200,2,221,hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and
200,2,222,took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about
200,2,223,the waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts
200,2,224,"stretching out into the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along"
200,2,225,this part of the coast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there
200,2,226,"is a south wind blowing, but after Phaestus the coast is more"
200,2,227,"protected, for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this"
200,2,228,part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews
200,2,229,"just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were"
200,2,230,"taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and"
200,2,231,substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at
200,2,232,home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed
200,2,233,"Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and the people were obedient under him,"
200,2,234,"but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens to be his bane,"
200,2,235,and killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral
200,2,236,rites of his mother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people
200,2,237,"of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus came home,31 with as much"
200,2,238,treasure as his ships could carry.
200,2,239,"“Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far"
200,2,240,"from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your"
200,2,241,"house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will"
200,2,242,"have been on a fool’s errand. Still, I should advise you by all means"
200,2,243,"to go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such"
200,2,244,"distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the"
200,2,245,winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds
200,2,246,"cannot fly the distance in a twelve - month, so vast and terrible are the"
200,2,247,"seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your"
200,2,248,own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a
200,2,249,"chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you"
200,2,250,"to Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and"
200,2,251,"he will tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.”"
200,2,252,"As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,"
200,2,253,"“Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues"
200,2,254,"of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink - offerings"
200,2,255,"to Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed"
200,2,256,time. People should go away early and not keep late hours at a
200,2,257,religious festival.”
200,2,258,"Thus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men"
200,2,259,"servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled"
200,2,260,"the mixing - bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving"
200,2,261,every man his drink offering; then they threw the tongues of the
200,2,262,"victims into the fire, and stood up to make their drink offerings. When"
200,2,263,they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was
200,2,264,"minded, Minerva and Telemachus were for going on board their ship, but"
200,2,265,Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.
200,2,266,"“Heaven and the immortal gods,” he exclaimed, “forbid that you should"
200,2,267,leave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and
200,2,268,"short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to"
200,2,269,find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell
200,2,270,"you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son"
200,2,271,of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship — not while I
200,2,272,"live — nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as I"
200,2,273,have done.”
200,2,274,"Then Minerva answered, “Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much"
200,2,275,"better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall"
200,2,276,"return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give"
200,2,277,"orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older"
200,2,278,"person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus’ own age,"
200,2,279,who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the
200,2,280,ship and sleep there. Moreover to - morrow I must go to the Cauconians
200,2,281,"where I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus,"
200,2,282,"now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let"
200,2,283,one of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him with your
200,2,284,best and fleetest horses.”
200,2,285,"When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and"
200,2,286,"all marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took"
200,2,287,"Telemachus by the hand. “My friend,” said he, “I see that you are going"
200,2,288,"to be a great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while"
200,2,289,you are still so young. This can have been none other of those who
200,2,290,"dwell in heaven than Jove’s redoubtable daughter, the Trito - born, who"
200,2,291,shewed such favour towards your brave father among the Argives. Holy
200,2,292,"queen,” he continued, “vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my"
200,2,293,"good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a"
200,2,294,"broad - browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by"
200,2,295,"man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you"
200,2,296,in sacrifice.”
200,2,297,"Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to"
200,2,298,"his own house, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got"
200,2,299,"there and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed"
200,2,300,them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the
200,2,301,housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the
200,2,302,"wine, he prayed much and made drink offerings to Minerva, daughter of"
200,2,303,"Aegis - bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink offerings and"
200,2,304,"had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home to bed"
200,2,305,each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room
200,2,306,"that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was the only"
200,2,307,"unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room"
200,2,308,"of the house, with the queen his wife by his side."
200,2,309,"Now when the child of morning rosy - fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left"
200,2,310,his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble
200,2,311,"that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of"
200,2,312,"gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the house of"
200,2,313,"Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat sceptre in hand, as guardian of the"
200,2,314,"public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him,"
200,2,315,"Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son"
200,2,316,"was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with"
200,2,317,them. Nestor then addressed them.
200,2,318,"“My sons,” said he, “make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first"
200,2,319,"and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested"
200,2,320,"herself visibly to me during yesterday’s festivities. Go, then, one or"
200,2,321,"other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer,"
200,2,322,"and come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus’ ship,"
200,2,323,"and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel."
200,2,324,Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the
200,2,325,"horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the"
200,2,326,"maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats,"
200,2,327,and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me some
200,2,328,clear spring water.”
200,2,329,On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was
200,2,330,"brought in from the plain, and Telemachus’s crew came from the ship;"
200,2,331,"the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he"
200,2,332,"worked his gold, and Minerva herself came to accept the sacrifice."
200,2,333,"Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer"
200,2,334,that the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and
200,2,335,Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the
200,2,336,"house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand"
200,2,337,he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a
200,2,338,"sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket."
200,2,339,Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley
200,2,340,"meal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from"
200,2,341,the heifer’s head upon the fire.
200,2,342,When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal32 Thrasymedes
200,2,343,"dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut"
200,2,344,"through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and"
200,2,345,"daughters in law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was"
200,2,346,eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they lifted
200,2,347,"the heifer’s head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut her throat."
200,2,348,"When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They"
200,2,349,"cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two"
200,2,350,"layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then"
200,2,351,"Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while"
200,2,352,the young men stood near him with five - pronged spits in their hands.
200,2,353,"When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they"
200,2,354,"cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the spits and"
200,2,355,toasted them over the fire.
200,2,356,"Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor’s youngest daughter, washed"
200,2,357,"Telemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she"
200,2,358,"brought him a fair mantle and shirt,33 and he looked like a god as he"
200,2,359,came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the
200,2,360,outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to
200,2,361,"dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept"
200,2,362,pouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had
200,2,363,"enough to eat and drink Nestor said, “Sons, put Telemachus’s horses to"
200,2,364,the chariot that he may start at once.”
200,2,365,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the"
200,2,366,fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision
200,2,367,"of bread, wine, and sweet meats fit for the sons of princes. Then"
200,2,368,"Telemachus got into the chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the"
200,2,369,reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they
200,2,370,"flew forward nothing loth into the open country, leaving the high"
200,2,371,"citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the"
200,2,372,yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all
200,2,373,"the land. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to"
200,2,374,Ortilochus and grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and
200,2,375,"Diocles entertained them hospitably. When the child of morning,"
200,2,376,"rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and drove"
200,2,377,out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse.34 Pisistratus
200,2,378,lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently they
200,2,379,"came to the corn lands of the open country, and in the course of time"
200,2,380,"completed their journey, so well did their steeds take them.35"
200,2,381,"Now when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,"
200,3,1,"THE VISIT TO KING MENELAUS, WHO TELLS HIS STORY — MEANWHILE THE SUITORS"
200,3,2,IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.
200,3,3,"they reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove"
200,3,4,"straight to the abode of Menelaus36 [and found him in his own house,"
200,3,5,"feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son,"
200,3,6,"and also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that"
200,3,7,valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her to
200,3,8,"him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the"
200,3,9,marriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses to the
200,3,10,city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles’ son was reigning. For his
200,3,11,"only son he had found a bride from Sparta,37 the daughter of Alector."
200,3,12,"This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven"
200,3,13,"vouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who was"
200,3,14,fair as golden Venus herself.
200,3,15,So the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making
200,3,16,merry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his
200,3,17,"lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them"
200,3,18,when the man struck up with his tune.38
200,3,19,"Telemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,"
200,3,20,"whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw"
200,3,21,them ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went close
200,3,22,"up to him and said, “Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two"
200,3,23,"men, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall we take their"
200,3,24,"horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?”"
200,3,25,"Menelaus was very angry and said, “Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never"
200,3,26,"used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses"
200,3,27,"out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper;"
200,3,28,you and I have staid often enough at other people’s houses before we
200,3,29,"got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace"
200,3,30,henceforward.”
200,3,31,So Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him.
200,3,32,"They took their sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to"
200,3,33,"the mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they"
200,3,34,"leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the"
200,3,35,way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when
200,3,36,"they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then,"
200,3,37,"when they had admired everything to their heart’s content, they went"
200,3,38,into the bath room and washed themselves.
200,3,39,"When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they"
200,3,40,"brought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by"
200,3,41,the side of Menelaus. A maid - servant brought them water in a beautiful
200,3,42,"golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their"
200,3,43,hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought
200,3,44,"them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the"
200,3,45,"house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and"
200,3,46,set cups of gold by their side.
200,3,47,"Menelaus then greeted them saying, “Fall to, and welcome; when you have"
200,3,48,"done supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as you"
200,3,49,cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of
200,3,50,"sceptre - bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you"
200,3,51,are.”
200,3,52,"On this he handed them39 a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set"
200,3,53,"near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good"
200,3,54,things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and
200,3,55,"drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close"
200,3,56,"that no one might hear, “Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see"
200,3,57,"the gleam of bronze and gold — of amber,40 ivory, and silver. Everything"
200,3,58,is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Jove. I am
200,3,59,lost in admiration.”
200,3,60,"Menelaus overheard him and said, “No one, my sons, can hold his own"
200,3,61,"with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but"
200,3,62,"among mortal men — well, there may be another who has as much wealth as I"
200,3,63,"have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and"
200,3,64,"have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I"
200,3,65,"could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the"
200,3,66,"Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the"
200,3,67,"Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are"
200,3,68,"born, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that"
200,3,69,"country, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good"
200,3,70,"milk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling"
200,3,71,"and getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly"
200,3,72,"and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, so that"
200,3,73,I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever your
200,3,74,"parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of my heavy"
200,3,75,loss in the ruin41 of a stately mansion fully and magnificently
200,3,76,furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so that I
200,3,77,"had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the plain"
200,3,78,"of Troy, far from Argos. I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for"
200,3,79,"one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I"
200,3,80,"leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it."
200,3,81,"Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for one man more than for them"
200,3,82,"all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep,"
200,3,83,"so miserable does he make me, for no one of all the Achaeans worked so"
200,3,84,"hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing by it, and has left a"
200,3,85,"legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we"
200,3,86,"know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his"
200,3,87,"long - suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left"
200,3,88,"behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.”"
200,3,89,"Thus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he"
200,3,90,bethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him
200,3,91,"thus mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with both"
200,3,92,hands. When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his
200,3,93,"own time for speaking, or to ask him at once and find what it was all"
200,3,94,about.
200,3,95,While he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted
200,3,96,"and perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought"
200,3,97,"her a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the"
200,3,98,silver work - box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus
200,3,99,"lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world;"
200,3,100,"he gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and ten"
200,3,101,"talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful"
200,3,102,"presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work box that ran on"
200,3,103,"wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed this by"
200,3,104,"her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet"
200,3,105,"coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat,"
200,3,106,"put her feet upon the footstool, and began to question her husband.42"
200,3,107,"“Do we know, Menelaus,” said she, “the names of these strangers who"
200,3,108,have come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong? — but I cannot help
200,3,109,saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like
200,3,110,somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what to think)
200,3,111,"as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby"
200,3,112,"behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in your hearts,"
200,3,113,on account of my most shameless self.”
200,3,114,"“My dear wife,” replied Menelaus, “I see the likeness just as you do."
200,3,115,"His hands and feet are just like Ulysses; so is his hair, with the"
200,3,116,"shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was"
200,3,117,"talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my"
200,3,118,"account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.”"
200,3,119,"Then Pisistratus said, “Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in"
200,3,120,"thinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and"
200,3,121,is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose
200,3,122,"conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor,"
200,3,123,"sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether you could"
200,3,124,give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home
200,3,125,when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this
200,3,126,"is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is"
200,3,127,no one among his own people to stand by him.”
200,3,128,"“Bless my heart,” replied Menelaus, “then I am receiving a visit from"
200,3,129,"the son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake."
200,3,130,I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when
200,3,131,heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have
200,3,132,"founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should have"
200,3,133,"made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and"
200,3,134,should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that
200,3,135,"are subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually,"
200,3,136,and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an
200,3,137,"intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great good"
200,3,138,"fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at"
200,3,139,all.”
200,3,140,"Thus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,"
200,3,141,"Telemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his"
200,3,142,"eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom"
200,3,143,"the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,"
200,3,144,"“Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me"
200,3,145,"you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be"
200,3,146,"possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am"
200,3,147,"getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon"
200,3,148,I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all
200,3,149,we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and
200,3,150,wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died at Troy; he
200,3,151,was by no means the worst man there; you are sure to have known him — his
200,3,152,"name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say"
200,3,153,that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.”
200,3,154,"“Your discretion, my friend,” answered Menelaus, “is beyond your years."
200,3,155,It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is
200,3,156,son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and
200,3,157,"offspring — and it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days,"
200,3,158,"giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who"
200,3,159,are both well disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all
200,3,160,"this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be poured over"
200,3,161,our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the
200,3,162,morning.”
200,3,163,"On this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands"
200,3,164,and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.
200,3,165,Then Jove’s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged
200,3,166,"the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour."
200,3,167,Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest
200,3,168,"of the day, not even though his father and mother both of them drop"
200,3,169,"down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very"
200,3,170,"eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to"
200,3,171,"Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all"
200,3,172,"sorts of herbs, some good to put into the mixing bowl and others"
200,3,173,"poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is a skilled"
200,3,174,"physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put this"
200,3,175,"drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round,"
200,3,176,she said:
200,3,177,"“Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable"
200,3,178,"men (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil,"
200,3,179,"and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I"
200,3,180,tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the
200,3,181,"exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy,"
200,3,182,and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself
200,3,183,"with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the"
200,3,184,"enemy’s city looking like a menial or a beggar, and quite different"
200,3,185,from what he did when he was among his own people. In this disguise he
200,3,186,"entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone"
200,3,187,"recognised him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for"
200,3,188,"me. When, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him"
200,3,189,"clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the"
200,3,190,"Trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships,"
200,3,191,he told me all that the Achaeans meant to do. He killed many Trojans
200,3,192,"and got much information before he reached the Argive camp, for all"
200,3,193,"which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I"
200,3,194,"was glad, for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I was"
200,3,195,"unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,"
200,3,196,"away from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is"
200,3,197,indeed by no means deficient either in person or understanding.”
200,3,198,"Then Menelaus said, “All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is"
200,3,199,"true. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but I"
200,3,200,"have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and"
200,3,201,"what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the"
200,3,202,bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and
200,3,203,destruction upon the Trojans.43 At that moment you came up to us; some
200,3,204,god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you
200,3,205,had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding
200,3,206,"place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and"
200,3,207,"mimicked all our wives — Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside"
200,3,208,heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds
200,3,209,"whether to spring out then and there, or to answer you from inside, but"
200,3,210,"Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except"
200,3,211,"Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two"
200,3,212,"brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that"
200,3,213,"saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away"
200,3,214,again.”
200,3,215,"“How sad,” exclaimed Telemachus, “that all this was of no avail to save"
200,3,216,"him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us"
200,3,217,"all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.”"
200,3,218,On this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was
200,3,219,"in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread"
200,3,220,coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to
200,3,221,"wear. So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to"
200,3,222,"which a man - servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did"
200,3,223,"Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while the son"
200,3,224,of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.
200,3,225,"When the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose"
200,3,226,"and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded"
200,3,227,"his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an"
200,3,228,"immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:"
200,3,229,"“And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to"
200,3,230,"Lacedaemon? Are you on public, or private business? Tell me all about"
200,3,231,it.”
200,3,232,"“I have come, sir,” replied Telemachus, “to see if you can tell me"
200,3,233,anything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my
200,3,234,"fair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who"
200,3,235,"keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of"
200,3,236,"paying their addresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your"
200,3,237,"knees if haply you may tell me about my father’s melancholy end,"
200,3,238,"whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other"
200,3,239,traveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out
200,3,240,"of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you"
200,3,241,saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by
200,3,242,"word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it"
200,3,243,in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.”
200,3,244,"Menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. “So,” he exclaimed,"
200,3,245,“these cowards would usurp a brave man’s bed? A hind might as well lay
200,3,246,"her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in"
200,3,247,the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his
200,3,248,lair will make short work with the pair of them — and so will Ulysses
200,3,249,"with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is"
200,3,250,still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in
200,3,251,"Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him — if"
200,3,252,"he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they would have a"
200,3,253,"short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I"
200,3,254,"will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without"
200,3,255,concealment all that the old man of the sea told me.
200,3,256,"“I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for"
200,3,257,"my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are"
200,3,258,"very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a"
200,3,259,"ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an"
200,3,260,island called Pharos — it has a good harbour from which vessels can get
200,3,261,out into open sea when they have taken in water — and here the gods
200,3,262,becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to
200,3,263,help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men
200,3,264,"would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved"
200,3,265,"me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of the"
200,3,266,"sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me."
200,3,267,"“She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the"
200,3,268,"men used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope"
200,3,269,of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger.
200,3,270,"‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘it seems to me that you like starving in this"
200,3,271,"way — at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day"
200,3,272,"after day, without even trying to get away though your men are dying by"
200,3,273,inches.’
200,3,274,"“‘Let me tell you,’ said I, ‘whichever of the goddesses you may happen"
200,3,275,"to be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have"
200,3,276,"offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods"
200,3,277,"know everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in"
200,3,278,"this way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my"
200,3,279,home.’
200,3,280,"“‘Stranger,’ replied she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. There"
200,3,281,is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is
200,3,282,"Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is"
200,3,283,Neptune’s head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom
200,3,284,"of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you"
200,3,285,"about your voyage, what courses you are to take, and how you are to"
200,3,286,"sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also tell you, if you so"
200,3,287,"will, all that has been going on at your house both good and bad, while"
200,3,288,you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.’
200,3,289,"“‘Can you show me,’ said I, ‘some stratagem by means of which I may"
200,3,290,catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a
200,3,291,god is not easily caught — not by a mortal man.’
200,3,292,"“‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. About"
200,3,293,"the time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the"
200,3,294,"sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs"
200,3,295,"the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and"
200,3,296,"goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals — Halosydne’s chickens"
200,3,297,"as they call them — come up also from the grey sea, and go to sleep in"
200,3,298,shoals all round him; and a very strong and fish - like smell do they
200,3,299,bring with them. 44 Early to - morrow morning I will take you to this
200,3,300,"place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best"
200,3,301,"men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the"
200,3,302,old man will play you.
200,3,303,"“‘First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he"
200,3,304,"has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep"
200,3,305,"among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he"
200,3,306,"is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for"
200,3,307,he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He will turn himself
200,3,308,"into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become"
200,3,309,also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him
200,3,310,"tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes back to"
200,3,311,what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your
200,3,312,hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that
200,3,313,"is angry with you, and what you must do to reach your home over the"
200,3,314,seas.’
200,3,315,"“Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the"
200,3,316,place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was
200,3,317,clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper
200,3,318,"ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach."
200,3,319,"“When the child of morning rosy - fingered Dawn appeared, I took the"
200,3,320,"three men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went"
200,3,321,"along by the sea - side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the"
200,3,322,"goddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all"
200,3,323,"of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father."
200,3,324,"Then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we"
200,3,325,"should come up. When we were close to her, she made us lie down in the"
200,3,326,"pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our"
200,3,327,"ambuscade would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy"
200,3,328,seals was most distressing45 — who would go to bed with a sea monster if
200,3,329,"he could help it? — but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of"
200,3,330,"something that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under"
200,3,331,"each man’s nostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of"
200,3,332,the seals.46
200,3,333,"“We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the"
200,3,334,"seals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the"
200,3,335,"old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he"
200,3,336,"went over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted,"
200,3,337,"and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep as"
200,3,338,soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and
200,3,339,"seized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed"
200,3,340,himself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he
200,3,341,"became a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running"
200,3,342,"water, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuck to him and"
200,3,343,"never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature became"
200,3,344,"distressed, and said, ‘Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that"
200,3,345,hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my
200,3,346,will? What do you want?’
200,3,347,"“‘You know that yourself, old man,’ I answered, ‘you will gain nothing"
200,3,348,by trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in this
200,3,349,"island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing all"
200,3,350,"heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the"
200,3,351,"immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail"
200,3,352,the sea so as to reach my home?’
200,3,353,"“Then,’ he said, ‘if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,"
200,3,354,you must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before
200,3,355,embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your
200,3,356,"friends, and to your own house, till you have returned to the"
200,3,357,"heaven - fed stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal"
200,3,358,gods that reign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you
200,3,359,finish your voyage.’
200,3,360,“I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long
200,3,361,"and terrible voyage to Egypt;47 nevertheless, I answered, ‘I will do"
200,3,362,"all, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me"
200,3,363,"true, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we"
200,3,364,"set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them"
200,3,365,came to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends
200,3,366,when the days of his fighting were done.’
200,3,367,"“‘Son of Atreus,’ he answered, ‘why ask me? You had better not know"
200,3,368,"what I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard"
200,3,369,"my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many"
200,3,370,"still remain, and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans perished"
200,3,371,during their return home. As for what happened on the field of
200,3,372,"battle — you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,"
200,3,373,"alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove"
200,3,374,"him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe"
200,3,375,"out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva’s hatred he would have"
200,3,376,"escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the"
200,3,377,"gods could not drown him even though they had tried to do so, and when"
200,3,378,"Neptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny"
200,3,379,"hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained"
200,3,380,"where it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into"
200,3,381,the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt water and was
200,3,382,drowned.
200,3,383,"“‘Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but when"
200,3,384,"he was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught"
200,3,385,by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his
200,3,386,"will, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but"
200,3,387,"where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed as"
200,3,388,"though he was to return safely after all, for the gods backed the wind"
200,3,389,into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed
200,3,390,"his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own"
200,3,391,country.
200,3,392,"“‘Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and"
200,3,393,to whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had been looking
200,3,394,out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the
200,3,395,"slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by, he"
200,3,396,"went and told Aegisthus, who at once began to lay a plot for him. He"
200,3,397,picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on
200,3,398,"one side the cloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a"
200,3,399,"banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon, and"
200,3,400,"invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all"
200,3,401,"unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the"
200,3,402,banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles;
200,3,403,"not one of Agamemnon’s followers was left alive, nor yet one of"
200,3,404,"Aegisthus’, but they were all killed there in the cloisters.’"
200,3,405,"“Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat"
200,3,406,down upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear
200,3,407,"to live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had"
200,3,408,"my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea"
200,3,409,"said, ‘Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly;"
200,3,410,it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you
200,3,411,"can, for Aegisthus may be still alive, and even though Orestes has been"
200,3,412,"beforehand with you in killing him, you may yet come in for his"
200,3,413,funeral.’
200,3,414,"“On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, ‘I know,"
200,3,415,"then, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of whom"
200,3,416,"you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home? or is"
200,3,417,"he dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.’"
200,3,418,"“‘The third man,’ he answered, ‘is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I can"
200,3,419,see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph
200,3,420,"Calypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for"
200,3,421,he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your own
200,3,422,"end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take you"
200,3,423,"to the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There"
200,3,424,"fair - haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any"
200,3,425,"where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail,"
200,3,426,"nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly"
200,3,427,"from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This will happen to you"
200,3,428,"because you have married Helen, and are Jove’s son - in - law.’"
200,3,429,"“As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the"
200,3,430,"ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went"
200,3,431,"along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was"
200,3,432,"falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,"
200,3,433,"rosy - fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and put"
200,3,434,"our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took"
200,3,435,"our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I again"
200,3,436,"stationed my ships in the heaven - fed stream of Egypt, and offered"
200,3,437,hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased
200,3,438,"heaven’s anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of Agamemnon that his"
200,3,439,"name might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home, for"
200,3,440,the gods sent me a fair wind.
200,3,441,"“And now for yourself — stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I"
200,3,442,will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present of a
200,3,443,chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice that
200,3,444,so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a
200,3,445,drink - offering to the immortal gods.”
200,3,446,"“Son of Atreus,” replied Telemachus, “do not press me to stay longer; I"
200,3,447,should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months; I
200,3,448,find your conversation so delightful that I should never once wish
200,3,449,myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos
200,3,450,"are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for any"
200,3,451,"present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should be"
200,3,452,"a piece of plate. I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca, but"
200,3,453,"will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have much flat"
200,3,454,"ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as also meadow - sweet and"
200,3,455,"wheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas"
200,3,456,"in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country"
200,3,457,"is more fit for goats than horses, and I like it the better for that."
200,3,458,"48 None of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and"
200,3,459,Ithaca least of all.”
200,3,460,Menelaus smiled and took Telemachus’s hand within his own. “What you
200,3,461,"say,” said he, “shows that you come of good family. I both can, and"
200,3,462,"will, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most"
200,3,463,precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl by
200,3,464,"Vulcan’s own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with"
200,3,465,"gold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a"
200,3,466,visit which I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey.
200,3,467,I will make you a present of it.”
200,3,468,Thus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king’s house.
200,3,469,"They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for"
200,3,470,them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in the
200,3,471,courts].49
200,3,472,Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a
200,3,473,"mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses’ house, and were"
200,3,474,"behaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who"
200,3,475,"were their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were"
200,3,476,sitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to
200,3,477,"Antinous,"
200,3,478,"“Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?"
200,3,479,"He has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis: I have"
200,3,480,twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet
200,3,481,"broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break him.”"
200,3,482,"They were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that"
200,3,483,Telemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was only
200,3,484,"away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the"
200,3,485,"swineherd; so Antinous said, “When did he go? Tell me truly, and what"
200,3,486,young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own
200,3,487,"bondsmen — for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him"
200,3,488,"have the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he"
200,3,489,take it without your leave?”
200,3,490,"“I lent it him,” answered Noemon, “what else could I do when a man of"
200,3,491,"his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige him? I"
200,3,492,could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they were the
200,3,493,"best young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain — or some"
200,3,494,"god who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor"
200,3,495,"here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for"
200,3,496,Pylos.”
200,3,497,"Noemon then went back to his father’s house, but Antinous and"
200,3,498,"Eurymachus were very angry. They told the others to leave off playing,"
200,3,499,"and to come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,"
200,3,500,Antinous son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with
200,3,501,"rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:"
200,3,502,"“Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we"
200,3,503,"had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow has"
200,3,504,"got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving"
200,3,505,us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find
200,3,506,"me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait"
200,3,507,for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the
200,3,508,day that he set out to try and get news of his father.”
200,3,509,"Thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all"
200,3,510,of them went inside the buildings.
200,3,511,It was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were
200,3,512,"plotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the"
200,3,513,"outer court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell"
200,3,514,his mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:
200,3,515,"“Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the"
200,3,516,maids to leave their master’s business and cook dinner for them? I wish
200,3,517,"they may neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere"
200,3,518,"else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of"
200,3,519,"my son’s estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children,"
200,3,520,"how good Ulysses had been to them — never doing anything high - handed, nor"
200,3,521,"speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they"
200,3,522,"may take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did"
200,3,523,"an unjust thing by anybody — which shows what bad hearts you have, and"
200,3,524,that there is no such thing as gratitude left in this world.”
200,3,525,"Then Medon said, “I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are"
200,3,526,plotting something much more dreadful now — may heaven frustrate their
200,3,527,design. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming
200,3,528,"home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his"
200,3,529,father.”
200,3,530,"Then Penelope’s heart sank within her, and for a long time she was"
200,3,531,"speechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no"
200,3,532,"utterance. At last, however, she said, “Why did my son leave me? What"
200,3,533,business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over
200,3,534,the ocean like sea - horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one
200,3,535,behind him to keep up his name?”
200,3,536,"“I do not know,” answered Medon, “whether some god set him on to it, or"
200,3,537,whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if his
200,3,538,"father was dead, or alive and on his way home.”"
200,3,539,"Then he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief."
200,3,540,"There were plenty of seats in the house, but she had no heart for"
200,3,541,sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor
200,3,542,"of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old"
200,3,543,"and young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last in a"
200,3,544,"transport of sorrow she exclaimed,"
200,3,545,"“My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction than"
200,3,546,any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and
200,3,547,"lion - hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and"
200,3,548,"whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my"
200,3,549,"darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having"
200,3,550,"heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one"
200,3,551,"of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though"
200,3,552,you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I had known he
200,3,553,"meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give it up, no matter"
200,3,554,"how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse behind him — one or"
200,3,555,"other. Now, however, go some of you and call old Dolius, who was given"
200,3,556,"me by my father on my marriage, and who is my gardener. Bid him go at"
200,3,557,"once and tell everything to Laertes, who may be able to hit on some"
200,3,558,"plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side, as against those who"
200,3,559,are trying to exterminate his own race and that of Ulysses.”
200,3,560,"Then the dear old nurse Euryclea said, “You may kill me, Madam, or let"
200,3,561,"me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the"
200,3,562,"real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in"
200,3,563,"the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I"
200,3,564,"would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you"
200,3,565,"asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did not want you"
200,3,566,"to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change"
200,3,567,"your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to"
200,3,568,"Minerva, daughter of Aegis - bearing Jove, for she can save him even"
200,3,569,though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has
200,3,570,"trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the"
200,3,571,"race of the son of Arceisius so much, but there will be a son left to"
200,3,572,"come up after him, and inherit both the house and the fair fields that"
200,3,573,lie far all round it.”
200,3,574,"With these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the"
200,3,575,"tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and"
200,3,576,went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a
200,3,577,basket and began praying to Minerva.
200,3,578,"“Hear me,” she cried, “Daughter of Aegis - bearing Jove, unweariable. If"
200,3,579,ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or
200,3,580,"heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son"
200,3,581,from the villainy of the suitors.”
200,3,582,"She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;"
200,3,583,"meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister,"
200,3,584,and one of them said:
200,3,585,“The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.
200,3,586,Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.”
200,3,587,"This was what they said, but they did not know what was going to"
200,3,588,"happen. Then Antinous said, “Comrades, let there be no loud talking,"
200,3,589,lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in
200,3,590,"silence, about which we are all of a mind.”"
200,3,591,"He then chose twenty men, and they went down to their ship and to the"
200,3,592,sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and
200,3,593,sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole - pins with twisted
200,3,594,"thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft,"
200,3,595,while their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made the
200,3,596,"ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and"
200,3,597,waited till night should fall.
200,3,598,"But Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink, and"
200,3,599,"wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by the"
200,3,600,wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen
200,3,601,hemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into
200,3,602,"a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion."
200,3,603,"Then Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in the"
200,3,604,likeness of Penelope’s sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who had
200,3,605,married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to the
200,3,606,"house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came"
200,3,607,into her room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the
200,3,608,"door to, and hovered over her head saying,"
200,3,609,"“You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer"
200,3,610,"you to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will"
200,3,611,yet come back to you.”
200,3,612,"Penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,"
200,3,613,"“Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I"
200,3,614,"suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to"
200,3,615,leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?
200,3,616,"I, who have lost my brave and lion - hearted husband, who had every good"
200,3,617,"quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and"
200,3,618,middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship — a
200,3,619,"foolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor to going"
200,3,620,about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than
200,3,621,"about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest"
200,3,622,"something should happen to him, either from the people among whom he"
200,3,623,"has gone, or by sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting against"
200,3,624,"him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home.”"
200,3,625,"Then the vision said, “Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There"
200,3,626,is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand
200,3,627,"by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you, and"
200,3,628,who has sent me to bear you this message.”
200,3,629,"“Then,” said Penelope, “if you are a god or have been sent here by"
200,3,630,"divine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one — is he"
200,3,631,"still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?”"
200,3,632,"And the vision said, “I shall not tell you for certain whether he is"
200,3,633,"alive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.”"
200,3,634,Then it vanished through the thong - hole of the door and was dissipated
200,3,635,into thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and
200,3,636,"comforted, so vivid had been her dream."
200,3,637,"Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea,"
200,3,638,intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called
200,3,639,"Asteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and"
200,3,640,there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then
200,3,641,the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.
200,3,642,BOOK V
200,3,643,CALYPSO — ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.
200,3,644,"And now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus — harbinger of light"
200,3,645,"alike to mortals and immortals — the gods met in council and with them,"
200,3,646,"Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to"
200,3,647,"tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away"
200,3,648,there in the house of the nymph Calypso.
200,3,649,"“Father Jove,” said she, “and all you other gods that live in"
200,3,650,"everlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and"
200,3,651,"well - disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope"
200,3,652,"they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of"
200,3,653,"his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as though he"
200,3,654,"were their father. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where"
200,3,655,"dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get"
200,3,656,"back to his own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to"
200,3,657,"take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to"
200,3,658,"murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and"
200,3,659,"Lacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news of his father.”"
200,3,660,"“What, my dear, are you talking about?” replied her father, “did you"
200,3,661,"not send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses"
200,3,662,"to get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to"
200,3,663,"protect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while the suitors"
200,3,664,have to come hurry - skurrying back without having killed him.”
200,3,665,"When he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, “Mercury, you are"
200,3,666,"our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor"
200,3,667,Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor
200,3,668,"men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to"
200,3,669,"reach fertile Scheria,50 the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of"
200,3,670,"kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he were one of"
200,3,671,"ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and will"
200,3,672,give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought
200,3,673,"back from Troy, if he had had all his prize money and had got home"
200,3,674,without disaster. This is how we have settled that he shall return to
200,3,675,his country and his friends.”
200,3,676,"Thus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as"
200,3,677,he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with
200,3,678,which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand
200,3,679,with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he
200,3,680,"pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped"
200,3,681,"down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose"
200,3,682,waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and
200,3,683,"corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He"
200,3,684,"flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the"
200,3,685,"island which was his journey’s end, he left the sea and went on by land"
200,3,686,till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.
200,3,687,"He found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and"
200,3,688,one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal
200,3,689,"wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden"
200,3,690,shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there
200,3,691,"was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees,"
200,3,692,"wherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests — owls, hawks, and"
200,3,693,chattering sea - crows that occupy their business in the waters. A vine
200,3,694,loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of
200,3,695,the cave; there were also four running rills of water in channels cut
200,3,696,"pretty close together, and turned hither and thither so as to irrigate"
200,3,697,the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. 51
200,3,698,"Even a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so"
200,3,699,Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it
200,3,700,sufficiently he went inside the cave.
200,3,701,"Calypso knew him at once — for the gods all know each other, no matter"
200,3,702,how far they live from one another — but Ulysses was not within; he was
200,3,703,"on the sea - shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears"
200,3,704,"in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave"
200,3,705,"Mercury a seat and said: “Why have you come to see me,"
200,3,706,"Mercury — honoured, and ever welcome — for you do not visit me often? Say"
200,3,707,"what you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can be"
200,3,708,"done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you.”"
200,3,709,As she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed
200,3,710,"him some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough,"
200,3,711,and then said:
200,3,712,"“We are speaking god and goddess to one another, and you ask me why I"
200,3,713,"have come here, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove"
200,3,714,sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all
200,3,715,this way over the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer
200,3,716,"me sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none"
200,3,717,"of us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says"
200,3,718,that you have here the most ill - starred of all those who fought nine
200,3,719,years before the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year
200,3,720,after having sacked it. On their way home they sinned against
200,3,721,"Minerva,52 who raised both wind and waves against them, so that all his"
200,3,722,"brave companions perished, and he alone was carried hither by wind and"
200,3,723,"tide. Jove says that you are to let this man go at once, for it is"
200,3,724,"decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but"
200,3,725,shall return to his house and country and see his friends again.”
200,3,726,"Calypso trembled with rage when she heard this, “You gods,” she"
200,3,727,"exclaimed, “ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous"
200,3,728,"and hate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with"
200,3,729,"him in open matrimony. So when rosy - fingered Dawn made love to Orion,"
200,3,730,you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed
200,3,731,"him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and"
200,3,732,"yielded to him in a thrice - ploughed fallow field, Jove came to hear of"
200,3,733,it before so very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts. And now
200,3,734,you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found the poor
200,3,735,"creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his"
200,3,736,"ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were"
200,3,737,"drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island."
200,3,738,"I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him"
200,3,739,"immortal, so that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot"
200,3,740,"cross Jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing; therefore, if he insists"
200,3,741,"upon it, let the man go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him"
200,3,742,anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men who can take him.
200,3,743,"Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good faith, as"
200,3,744,will be likely to bring him safely to his own country.”
200,3,745,"“Then send him away,” said Mercury, “or Jove will be angry with you and"
200,3,746,punish you”.
200,3,747,"On this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses,"
200,3,748,for she had heard Jove’s message. She found him sitting upon the beach
200,3,749,"with his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness;"
200,3,750,"for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with"
200,3,751,"her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have it so. As"
200,3,752,"for the day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore,"
200,3,753,"weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon the"
200,3,754,sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:
200,3,755,"“My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your"
200,3,756,life out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will;
200,3,757,"so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an"
200,3,758,"upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread,"
200,3,759,"wine, and water on board to save you from starving. I will also give"
200,3,760,"you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home, if the"
200,3,761,"gods in heaven so will it — for they know more about these things, and"
200,3,762,can settle them better than I can.”
200,3,763,"Ulysses shuddered as he heard her. “Now goddess,” he answered, “there"
200,3,764,is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me
200,3,765,home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft.
200,3,766,Not even a well found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a
200,3,767,distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall make me go on
200,3,768,board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no
200,3,769,mischief.”
200,3,770,Calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: “You know a
200,3,771,"great deal,” said she, “but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above"
200,3,772,"and earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx — and"
200,3,773,this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take — that I mean
200,3,774,"you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly what I"
200,3,775,should do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite
200,3,776,"straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry"
200,3,777,for you.”
200,3,778,"When she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and"
200,3,779,"Ulysses followed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on"
200,3,780,"and on till they came to Calypso’s cave, where Ulysses took the seat"
200,3,781,that Mercury had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of
200,3,782,the food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar
200,3,783,"for herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were"
200,3,784,"before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,"
200,3,785,"Calypso spoke, saying:"
200,3,786,"“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own"
200,3,787,"land at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how"
200,3,788,much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own
200,3,789,"country, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and"
200,3,790,"let me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see this"
200,3,791,"wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet"
200,3,792,I flatter myself that I am no whit less tall or well - looking than she
200,3,793,"is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should compare in"
200,3,794,beauty with an immortal.”
200,3,795,"“Goddess,” replied Ulysses, “do not be angry with me about this. I am"
200,3,796,quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so
200,3,797,"beautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an"
200,3,798,"immortal. Nevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing"
200,3,799,"else. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and"
200,3,800,make the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea
200,3,801,"already, so let this go with the rest.”"
200,3,802,"Presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into"
200,3,803,the inner part of the cave and went to bed.
200,3,804,"When the child of morning rosy - fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on"
200,3,805,"his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer"
200,3,806,"fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about"
200,3,807,her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to
200,3,808,think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a great
200,3,809,"bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and"
200,3,810,had a beautiful olive - wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave
200,3,811,"him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of the island"
200,3,812,"where the largest trees grew — alder, poplar and pine, that reached the"
200,3,813,"sky — very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the"
200,3,814,"water.53 Then, when she had shown him where the best trees grew,"
200,3,815,"Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished"
200,3,816,"doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring"
200,3,817,them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back
200,3,818,"with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers"
200,3,819,together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled
200,3,820,"shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top"
200,3,821,"of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a"
200,3,822,"yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round with"
200,3,823,"wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then he threw on"
200,3,824,a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him some linen to make
200,3,825,"the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making them fast with"
200,3,826,"braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers, he drew the"
200,3,827,raft down into the water.
200,3,828,"In four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso"
200,3,829,sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean
200,3,830,"clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another"
200,3,831,"larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and"
200,3,832,"found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm"
200,3,833,"for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it, while he sat"
200,3,834,and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder. He never closed
200,3,835,"his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late - setting Bootes,"
200,3,836,"and on the Bear — which men also call the wain, and which turns round and"
200,3,837,"round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into the"
200,3,838,stream of Oceanus — for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left.
200,3,839,"Days seven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the"
200,3,840,dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian
200,3,841,"coast appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon."
200,3,842,"But King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight"
200,3,843,"of Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could"
200,3,844,"see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged"
200,3,845,"his head and muttered to himself, saying, “Good heavens, so the gods"
200,3,846,have been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in
200,3,847,"Ethiopia, and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it"
200,3,848,is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen
200,3,849,"him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done"
200,3,850,with it.”
200,3,851,"Thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred"
200,3,852,"it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till"
200,3,853,"earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of"
200,3,854,"the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all"
200,3,855,"at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses’ heart"
200,3,856,"began to fail him. “Alas,” he said to himself in his dismay, “what ever"
200,3,857,will become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she said I should
200,3,858,have trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming true. How
200,3,859,"black is Jove making heaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds"
200,3,860,are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest
200,3,861,and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause
200,3,862,of the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when the
200,3,863,"Trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for"
200,3,864,then I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured
200,3,865,my name; but now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.”
200,3,866,As he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft
200,3,867,"reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go"
200,3,868,"the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke the"
200,3,869,"mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea. For a"
200,3,870,"long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do to rise"
200,3,871,"to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him"
200,3,872,down; but at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter
200,3,873,"brine that was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this,"
200,3,874,"however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he"
200,3,875,"could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to"
200,3,876,escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn
200,3,877,winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though
200,3,878,"the South, North, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and"
200,3,879,shuttlecock with it at once.
200,3,880,"When he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called"
200,3,881,"Leucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been"
200,3,882,since raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great
200,3,883,"distress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like"
200,3,884,"a sea - gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft."
200,3,885,"“My poor good man,” said she, “why is Neptune so furiously angry with"
200,3,886,"you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster"
200,3,887,"he will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I"
200,3,888,"bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind, and swim to"
200,3,889,"the Phaeacian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take my"
200,3,890,"veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to"
200,3,891,"no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off,"
200,3,892,"throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then go away again.”"
200,3,893,With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived
200,3,894,down again like a sea - gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.
200,3,895,"But Ulysses did not know what to think. “Alas,” he said to himself in"
200,3,896,"his dismay, “this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring"
200,3,897,me to ruin by advising me to quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so
200,3,898,"at present, for the land where she said I should be quit of all"
200,3,899,troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know what I will do — I am
200,3,900,sure it will be best — no matter what happens I will stick to the raft as
200,3,901,"long as her timbers hold together, but when the sea breaks her up I"
200,3,902,will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any better than this.”
200,3,903,"While he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that"
200,3,904,"seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft,"
200,3,905,which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed
200,3,906,about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it
200,3,907,as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had
200,3,908,"given him, bound Ino’s veil under his arms, and plunged into the"
200,3,909,"sea — meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched him as he did so,"
200,3,910,"and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying, “There now, swim"
200,3,911,up and down as you best can till you fall in with well - to - do people. I
200,3,912,do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too
200,3,913,lightly.” On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his
200,3,914,palace is.
200,3,915,"But Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the"
200,3,916,"winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good"
200,3,917,stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses
200,3,918,reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.
200,3,919,"Thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with"
200,3,920,a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when
200,3,921,"the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so"
200,3,922,much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked
200,3,923,"eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children rejoice"
200,3,924,when their dear father begins to get better after having for a long
200,3,925,"time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but the gods"
200,3,926,"deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when he again saw land"
200,3,927,"and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might once more"
200,3,928,"set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he"
200,3,929,"began to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell"
200,3,930,still broke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped
200,3,931,"in spray; there were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter"
200,3,932,"of any kind, but only headlands, low - lying rocks, and mountain tops."
200,3,933,"Ulysses’ heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to"
200,3,934,"himself, “Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I"
200,3,935,"had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast"
200,3,936,"is rocky and surf - beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the"
200,3,937,"sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot climb out for"
200,3,938,want of foot hold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs
200,3,939,and dash me against the rocks as I leave the water — which would give me
200,3,940,"a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of"
200,3,941,"some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me out to sea"
200,3,942,"again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster of"
200,3,943,"the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that"
200,3,944,Neptune is very angry with me.”
200,3,945,While he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such
200,3,946,force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to
200,3,947,pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the
200,3,948,rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till the wave
200,3,949,"retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave came on"
200,3,950,again and carried him back with it far into the sea — tearing his hands
200,3,951,as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks it from its
200,3,952,"bed, and the stones come up along with it — even so did the rocks tear"
200,3,953,"the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep down"
200,3,954,under the water.
200,3,955,Here poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his
200,3,956,"own destiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him."
200,3,957,"He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating"
200,3,958,"against the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the"
200,3,959,"shore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take"
200,3,960,"the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a"
200,3,961,"river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there were no"
200,3,962,"rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a"
200,3,963,"current, so he prayed inwardly and said:"
200,3,964,"“Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the"
200,3,965,"sea - god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost"
200,3,966,"his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my"
200,3,967,"distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees of your"
200,3,968,"riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself your"
200,3,969,suppliant.”
200,3,970,"Then the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm"
200,3,971,"before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here"
200,3,972,"at last Ulysses’ knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had"
200,3,973,"completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and"
200,3,974,"nostrils ran down like a river with sea - water, so that he could neither"
200,3,975,"breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,"
200,3,976,"when he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off the"
200,3,977,scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt54 stream
200,3,978,"of the river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that"
200,3,979,"bore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among"
200,3,980,"the rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth."
200,3,981,"“Alas,” he cried to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of"
200,3,982,"me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through"
200,3,983,"the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold"
200,3,984,and damp may make an end of me — for towards sunrise there will be a keen
200,3,985,"wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand, I climb the"
200,3,986,"hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may"
200,3,987,"escape the cold and have a good night’s rest, but some savage beast may"
200,3,988,take advantage of me and devour me.”
200,3,989,"In the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one"
200,3,990,upon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath
200,3,991,two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock — the one an ungrafted
200,3,992,"sucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally,"
200,3,993,"could break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun’s rays"
200,3,994,"pierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow"
200,3,995,into one another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself a
200,3,996,"bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying"
200,3,997,about — enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard
200,3,998,"winter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down"
200,3,999,"and heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in"
200,3,1000,"the country, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire - seed in the"
200,3,1001,"ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did"
200,3,1002,Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep
200,3,1003,"upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose all memories of"
200,3,1004,his sorrows.
200,4,1,THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.
200,4,2,"So here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off"
200,4,3,to the country and city of the Phaeacians — a people who used to live in
200,4,4,"the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes"
200,4,5,"were stronger than they and plundered them, so their king Nausithous"
200,4,6,"moved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all other"
200,4,7,"people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples,"
200,4,8,and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone to the
200,4,9,"house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were inspired of"
200,4,10,"heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in"
200,4,11,furtherance of the return of Ulysses.
200,4,12,She went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there
200,4,13,"slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King"
200,4,14,"Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty,"
200,4,15,"one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well made"
200,4,16,folding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas’s
200,4,17,"daughter, who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age;"
200,4,18,"then, coming up to the girl’s bedside like a breath of wind, she"
200,4,19,hovered over her head and said:
200,4,20,"“Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy"
200,4,21,"daughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are"
200,4,22,"going to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well"
200,4,23,"dressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend"
200,4,24,"you. This is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your"
200,4,25,"father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a"
200,4,26,"washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you so that"
200,4,27,"you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best"
200,4,28,"young men among your own people are courting you, and you are not going"
200,4,29,"to remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a"
200,4,30,"waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and"
200,4,31,"girdles, and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you"
200,4,32,"than walking, for the washing - cisterns are some way from the town.”"
200,4,33,"When she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say is"
200,4,34,"the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and"
200,4,35,neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine
200,4,36,"and in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are"
200,4,37,illumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which the goddess
200,4,38,went when she had given instructions to the girl.
200,4,39,"By and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about her"
200,4,40,dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her
200,4,41,"father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her"
200,4,42,mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her
200,4,43,"maids around her, and she happened to catch her father just as he was"
200,4,44,"going out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian"
200,4,45,aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:
200,4,46,"“Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want"
200,4,47,to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are the
200,4,48,"chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a clean shirt"
200,4,49,"when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons"
200,4,50,"at home, two of them married, while the other three are good looking"
200,4,51,bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go
200,4,52,"to a dance, and I have been thinking about all this.”"
200,4,53,"She did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to,"
200,4,54,"but her father knew and said, “You shall have the mules, my love, and"
200,4,55,"whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall"
200,4,56,get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your
200,4,57,clothes.”
200,4,58,"On this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out,"
200,4,59,"harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the"
200,4,60,clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her
200,4,61,mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good
200,4,62,"things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon,"
200,4,63,"and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her"
200,4,64,women might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and reins and
200,4,65,"lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on"
200,4,66,"the road. They pulled without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa"
200,4,67,"and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were with her."
200,4,68,"When they reached the water side they went to the washing cisterns,"
200,4,69,through which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any
200,4,70,"quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules"
200,4,71,and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the
200,4,72,"water side. They took the clothes out of the waggon, put them in the"
200,4,73,"water, and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get"
200,4,74,"the dirt out. After they had washed them and got them quite clean, they"
200,4,75,"laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach"
200,4,76,"of shingle, and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves"
200,4,77,"with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream,"
200,4,78,and waited for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done
200,4,79,dinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to
200,4,80,"play at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes"
200,4,81,forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars
200,4,82,"or deer, and the wood nymphs, daughters of Aegis - bearing Jove, take"
200,4,83,their sport along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter
200,4,84,"stand a full head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest"
200,4,85,"amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her"
200,4,86,handmaids.
200,4,87,"When it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the"
200,4,88,"clothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider how"
200,4,89,Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him
200,4,90,"to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one"
200,4,91,"of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they"
200,4,92,"all shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat up in his"
200,4,93,bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.
200,4,94,"“Alas,” said he to himself, “what kind of people have I come amongst?"
200,4,95,"Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilised, or hospitable and humane? I"
200,4,96,"seem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those of"
200,4,97,"the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows"
200,4,98,of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let me
200,4,99,try if I cannot manage to get a look at them.”
200,4,100,"As he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough"
200,4,101,covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some
200,4,102,lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and
200,4,103,defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of
200,4,104,"oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even into"
200,4,105,"a well fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep — even such did"
200,4,106,"Ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked as"
200,4,107,"he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so"
200,4,108,"begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off along the spits that"
200,4,109,"jutted out into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm, for"
200,4,110,Minerva put courage into her heart and took away all fear from her. She
200,4,111,"stood right in front of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he should go up"
200,4,112,"to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees as a"
200,4,113,"suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her to give him some"
200,4,114,clothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he deemed it best
200,4,115,to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offence at
200,4,116,"his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her in"
200,4,117,honeyed and persuasive language.
200,4,118,"“O queen,” he said, “I implore your aid — but tell me, are you a goddess"
200,4,119,"or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven, I"
200,4,120,"can only conjecture that you are Jove’s daughter Diana, for your face"
200,4,121,and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a
200,4,122,"mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and"
200,4,123,"mother — thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and"
200,4,124,delighted they must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself
200,4,125,"going out to a dance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose"
200,4,126,"wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes you to his own home."
200,4,127,"I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am"
200,4,128,lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young
200,4,129,palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of
200,4,130,"Apollo — for I was there, too, with much people after me, when I was on"
200,4,131,that journey which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet
200,4,132,"did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I"
200,4,133,admired and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at
200,4,134,"yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I am in great distress;"
200,4,135,yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the
200,4,136,sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian
200,4,137,"island,55 and now fate has flung me upon this coast that I may endure"
200,4,138,still further suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to the
200,4,139,"end of it, but rather that heaven has still much evil in store for me."
200,4,140,"“And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I"
200,4,141,"have met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to"
200,4,142,"your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to"
200,4,143,wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart’s
200,4,144,"desire — husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing"
200,4,145,better in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a
200,4,146,"house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends"
200,4,147,"glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.”"
200,4,148,"To this Nausicaa answered, “Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,"
200,4,149,well - disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives
200,4,150,"prosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what"
200,4,151,"he has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now, however,"
200,4,152,"that you have come to this our country, you shall not want for clothes"
200,4,153,nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look
200,4,154,"for. I will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the name of"
200,4,155,"our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to Alcinous, in"
200,4,156,whom the whole power of the state is vested.”
200,4,157,"Then she called her maids and said, “Stay where you are, you girls. Can"
200,4,158,you not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a
200,4,159,robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do
200,4,160,"us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on"
200,4,161,"a land’s end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing to do"
200,4,162,"with any other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way,"
200,4,163,"and we must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners in distress"
200,4,164,"are under Jove’s protection, and will take what they can get and be"
200,4,165,"thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to eat and drink,"
200,4,166,and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from the
200,4,167,wind.”
200,4,168,On this the maids left off running away and began calling one another
200,4,169,back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told
200,4,170,"them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the"
200,4,171,"little golden cruse of oil, and told him to go and wash in the stream."
200,4,172,"But Ulysses said, “Young women, please to stand a little on one side"
200,4,173,"that I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil,"
200,4,174,for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I
200,4,175,cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to
200,4,176,strip56 before a number of good looking young women.”
200,4,177,"Then they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses"
200,4,178,washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and
200,4,179,"from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and"
200,4,180,"had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and"
200,4,181,put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made him
200,4,182,"look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair grow thick"
200,4,183,"on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;"
200,4,184,she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful workman who
200,4,185,has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva enriches a piece
200,4,186,of silver plate by gilding it — and his work is full of beauty. Then he
200,4,187,"went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young"
200,4,188,"and handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said"
200,4,189,to her maids:
200,4,190,"“Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who"
200,4,191,live in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw
200,4,192,"him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the"
200,4,193,gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be just
200,4,194,"such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to go"
200,4,195,"away. However, give him something to eat and drink.”"
200,4,196,"They did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and"
200,4,197,"drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind."
200,4,198,"Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen"
200,4,199,"folded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she"
200,4,200,"took her seat, she called Ulysses:"
200,4,201,"“Stranger,” said she, “rise and let us be going back to the town; I"
200,4,202,"will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can"
200,4,203,tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians.
200,4,204,"But be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible person."
200,4,205,"As long as we are going past the fields and farm lands, follow briskly"
200,4,206,behind the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself.
200,4,207,"Presently, however, we shall come to the town, where you will find a"
200,4,208,"high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on either side with"
200,4,209,"a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the"
200,4,210,"road side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You"
200,4,211,"will see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it,"
200,4,212,and paved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in
200,4,213,"ship’s gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are"
200,4,214,"the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of"
200,4,215,"archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea - faring"
200,4,216,"folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which"
200,4,217,they travel far over the sea.
200,4,218,“I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against
200,4,219,"me later on; for the people here are very ill - natured, and some low"
200,4,220,"fellow, if he met us, might say, ‘Who is this fine - looking stranger"
200,4,221,that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose
200,4,222,she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has
200,4,223,"taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or some god"
200,4,224,"has at last come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she is"
200,4,225,going to live with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good
200,4,226,"thing if she would take herself off and find a husband somewhere else,"
200,4,227,for she will not look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who
200,4,228,are in love with her.’ This is the kind of disparaging remark that
200,4,229,"would be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself"
200,4,230,"be scandalised at seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with"
200,4,231,"men in spite of everybody, while her father and mother were still"
200,4,232,"alive, and without having been married in the face of all the world."
200,4,233,"“If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help"
200,4,234,"you home, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by"
200,4,235,the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow
200,4,236,"all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about"
200,4,237,as far from the town as a man’s voice will carry. Sit down there and
200,4,238,wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach my
200,4,239,"father’s house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into"
200,4,240,the town and ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous. You will
200,4,241,"have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it out to you,"
200,4,242,for no one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine house
200,4,243,as he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer
200,4,244,"court, go right across the inner court till you come to my mother. You"
200,4,245,will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by
200,4,246,firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leans back against one
200,4,247,of the bearing - posts with her maids all ranged behind her. Close to her
200,4,248,"seat stands that of my father, on which he sits and topes like an"
200,4,249,"immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my mother, and lay your"
200,4,250,hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you can gain her
200,4,251,"over, you may hope to see your own country again, no matter how distant"
200,4,252,it may be.”
200,4,253,So saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.
200,4,254,"The mules drew well, and their hoofs went up and down upon the road."
200,4,255,She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were
200,4,256,"following on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with"
200,4,257,judgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of
200,4,258,"Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter"
200,4,259,of Jove.
200,4,260,"“Hear me,” he cried, “daughter of Aegis - bearing Jove, unweariable, hear"
200,4,261,"me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking"
200,4,262,"me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends"
200,4,263,and be hospitably received by the Phaeacians.”
200,4,264,"Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show"
200,4,265,"herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, who was"
200,4,266,still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting home.
200,5,1,RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.
200,5,2,"Thus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the"
200,5,3,"town. When she reached her father’s house she drew up at the gateway,"
200,5,4,"and her brothers — comely as the gods — gathered round her, took the mules"
200,5,5,"out of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she"
200,5,6,"went to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit"
200,5,7,"the fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,"
200,5,8,and had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over
200,5,9,"the Phaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god.57"
200,5,10,"She had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and"
200,5,11,brought her supper for her into her own room.
200,5,12,Presently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a
200,5,13,thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud
200,5,14,"Phaeacians who met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was."
200,5,15,"Then, as he was just entering the town, she came towards him in the"
200,5,16,likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front
200,5,17,"of him, and Ulysses said:"
200,5,18,"“My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?"
200,5,19,"I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your"
200,5,20,town and country.”
200,5,21,"Then Minerva said, “Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you"
200,5,22,"want, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before"
200,5,23,"you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look at"
200,5,24,"any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide"
200,5,25,"strangers, and do not like men who come from some other place. They are"
200,5,26,"a sea - faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships"
200,5,27,"that glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air.”"
200,5,28,"On this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one"
200,5,29,of the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the
200,5,30,midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards
200,5,31,him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their
200,5,32,"harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,"
200,5,33,"which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when"
200,5,34,they reached the king’s house Minerva said:
200,5,35,"“This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you."
200,5,36,"You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do not be"
200,5,37,"afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is"
200,5,38,"to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen."
200,5,39,"Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband"
200,5,40,"Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune, who was father to"
200,5,41,"Nausithous by Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the"
200,5,42,"youngest daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the"
200,5,43,"giants, but he ruined his ill - fated people and lost his own life to"
200,5,44,boot.
200,5,45,"“Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the"
200,5,46,"great Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two"
200,5,47,sons Rhexenor and Alcinous;58 Apollo killed the first of them while he
200,5,48,was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter
200,5,49,"Arete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other woman is honoured"
200,5,50,of all those that keep house along with their husbands.
200,5,51,"“Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her"
200,5,52,"children, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon"
200,5,53,"her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for"
200,5,54,"she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any"
200,5,55,"women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle"
200,5,56,"their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope"
200,5,57,"of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to your home and"
200,5,58,country.”
200,5,59,Then Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to
200,5,60,"Marathon59 and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered the"
200,5,61,"abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous, and"
200,5,62,he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold of
200,5,63,"bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or"
200,5,64,"moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the"
200,5,65,"cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of"
200,5,66,"silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver"
200,5,67,and the hook of the door was of gold.
200,5,68,"On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with"
200,5,69,"his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the"
200,5,70,palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow
200,5,71,"old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end"
200,5,72,"to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the"
200,5,73,house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit
200,5,74,"and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there"
200,5,75,"were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands,"
200,5,76,"raised on pedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table."
200,5,77,"There are60 fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always"
200,5,78,"grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom,"
200,5,79,"or sit and spin, and their shuttles go backwards and forwards like the"
200,5,80,"fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it"
200,5,81,"will turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so"
200,5,82,"their women excel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them"
200,5,83,"all manner of useful arts, and they are very intelligent."
200,5,84,Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about
200,5,85,four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful
200,5,86,"trees — pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are"
200,5,87,"luscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor"
200,5,88,"fail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so"
200,5,89,soft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on
200,5,90,"pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for"
200,5,91,"there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,"
200,5,92,the grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being
200,5,93,"gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on"
200,5,94,"have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again"
200,5,95,are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are
200,5,96,beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year
200,5,97,"round. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout"
200,5,98,"the whole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the"
200,5,99,"outer court to the house itself, and the town’s people draw water from"
200,5,100,"it. Such, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the"
200,5,101,house of king Alcinous.
200,5,102,"So here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he had"
200,5,103,looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the
200,5,104,precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the
200,5,105,"Phaeacians making their drink offerings to Mercury, which they always"
200,5,106,did the last thing before going away for the night.61 He went straight
200,5,107,"through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which"
200,5,108,"Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King Alcinous;"
200,5,109,"then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at that moment"
200,5,110,the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became visible. Every
200,5,111,"one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there, but Ulysses"
200,5,112,began at once with his petition.
200,5,113,"“Queen Arete,” he exclaimed, “daughter of great Rhexenor, in my"
200,5,114,"distress I humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests"
200,5,115,"(whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they"
200,5,116,"leave their possessions to their children, and all the honours"
200,5,117,conferred upon them by the state) to help me home to my own country as
200,5,118,soon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my
200,5,119,friends.”
200,5,120,Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their
200,5,121,"peace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent"
200,5,122,"speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty"
200,5,123,addressed them thus:
200,5,124,"“Alcinous,” said he, “it is not creditable to you that a stranger"
200,5,125,should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is
200,5,126,"waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and"
200,5,127,"take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix"
200,5,128,some wine and water that we may make a drink offering to Jove the lord
200,5,129,"of thunder, who takes all well disposed suppliants under his"
200,5,130,"protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever"
200,5,131,there may be in the house.”
200,5,132,"When Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from"
200,5,133,"the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been"
200,5,134,"sitting beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then"
200,5,135,brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a
200,5,136,"silver basin for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table"
200,5,137,beside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many
200,5,138,"good things of what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank."
200,5,139,"Then Alcinous said to one of the servants, “Pontonous, mix a cup of"
200,5,140,wine and hand it round that we may make drink - offerings to Jove the
200,5,141,"lord of thunder, who is the protector of all well - disposed suppliants.”"
200,5,142,"Pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving"
200,5,143,"every man his drink - offering. When they had made their offerings, and"
200,5,144,"had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:"
200,5,145,"“Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You"
200,5,146,"have had your supper, so now go home to bed. To - morrow morning I shall"
200,5,147,"invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial"
200,5,148,banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his
200,5,149,"escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his"
200,5,150,"own country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how"
200,5,151,distant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his
200,5,152,"homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take the"
200,5,153,luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is
200,5,154,"possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who has"
200,5,155,come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods are
200,5,156,"departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made"
200,5,157,themselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them
200,5,158,"hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,"
200,5,159,and if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other
200,5,160,"of them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the"
200,5,161,gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.”62
200,5,162,"Then Ulysses said: “Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into"
200,5,163,"your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body nor"
200,5,164,"mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted."
200,5,165,"Indeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me,"
200,5,166,"you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,"
200,5,167,"let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very"
200,5,168,"importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man’s notice no matter how"
200,5,169,"dire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I"
200,5,170,"shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and"
200,5,171,"dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as"
200,5,172,"you propose, and at break of day set about helping me to get home. I"
200,5,173,"shall be content to die if I may first once more behold my property, my"
200,5,174,"bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house.”63"
200,5,175,"Thus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he"
200,5,176,should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when
200,5,177,"they had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he"
200,5,178,"was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving"
200,5,179,Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were
200,5,180,"taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak, for"
200,5,181,"she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses was"
200,5,182,"wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,"
200,5,183,"“Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like"
200,5,184,"to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes?"
200,5,185,Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?”
200,5,186,"And Ulysses answered, “It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate"
200,5,187,"in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been"
200,5,188,"laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island"
200,5,189,far away in the sea which is called ‘the Ogygian.’ Here dwells the
200,5,190,"cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by"
200,5,191,"herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however,"
200,5,192,"brought me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my"
200,5,193,"ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid - ocean. My brave"
200,5,194,"comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and"
200,5,195,"was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last"
200,5,196,during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the
200,5,197,Ogygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in
200,5,198,and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me
200,5,199,"immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to"
200,5,200,let her do so.
200,5,201,"“I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the"
200,5,202,good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at
200,5,203,last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free
200,5,204,"will, either because Jove had told her she must, or because she had"
200,5,205,"changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she"
200,5,206,provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good
200,5,207,"stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days"
200,5,208,"seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught"
200,5,209,sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast — and glad
200,5,210,indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much
200,5,211,"trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no"
200,5,212,"further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly"
200,5,213,"high that I could no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under"
200,5,214,"the fury of the gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current"
200,5,215,brought me to your shores.
200,5,216,"“There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the"
200,5,217,"waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam"
200,5,218,"on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place,"
200,5,219,"for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then,"
200,5,220,I got out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was
200,5,221,"coming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I"
200,5,222,"covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off"
200,5,223,into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the
200,5,224,"leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke"
200,5,225,"as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter’s maid servants playing"
200,5,226,"upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I"
200,5,227,"besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition,"
200,5,228,much more so than could be expected from so young a person — for young
200,5,229,"people are apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine,"
200,5,230,and when she had had me washed in the river she also gave me the
200,5,231,"clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to"
200,5,232,"do so, I have told you the whole truth.”"
200,5,233,"Then Alcinous said, “Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to"
200,5,234,"bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she"
200,5,235,was the first person whose aid you asked.”
200,5,236,"“Pray do not scold her,” replied Ulysses; “she is not to blame. She did"
200,5,237,"tell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid,"
200,5,238,for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every
200,5,239,human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.”
200,5,240,"“Stranger,” replied Alcinous, “I am not the kind of man to get angry"
200,5,241,about nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father
200,5,242,"Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are,"
200,5,243,"and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my"
200,5,244,"daughter, and become my son - in - law. If you will stay I will give you a"
200,5,245,"house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here"
200,5,246,"against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend"
200,5,247,tomorrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep64 during the whole
200,5,248,"voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters"
200,5,249,"either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a"
200,5,250,"long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people who saw it"
200,5,251,when they took yellow - haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of
200,5,252,"Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place — and yet they did the whole"
200,5,253,"voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, and came back"
200,5,254,"again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships excel all others,"
200,5,255,and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.”
200,5,256,"Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, “Father Jove, grant that"
200,5,257,"Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable"
200,5,258,"name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.”"
200,5,259,Thus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the
200,5,260,"room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to"
200,5,261,spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to
200,5,262,"wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when"
200,5,263,"they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said, “Rise, sir"
200,5,264,"stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,” and glad indeed was"
200,5,265,he to go to his rest.
200,5,266,So Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;
200,5,267,"but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his"
200,5,268,wife by his side.
200,6,1,BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS — THE GAMES.
200,6,2,"Now when the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous"
200,6,3,"and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place"
200,6,4,"of assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat"
200,6,5,"down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the"
200,6,6,"form of one of Alcinous’ servants, and went round the town in order to"
200,6,7,"help Ulysses to get home. She went up to the citizens, man by man, and"
200,6,8,"said, “Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, come to the"
200,6,9,assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off a
200,6,10,long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal
200,6,11,god.”
200,6,12,"With these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to"
200,6,13,the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one
200,6,14,"was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified"
200,6,15,"him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter"
200,6,16,"than he really was, that he might impress the Phaeacians favourably as"
200,6,17,"being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials"
200,6,18,"of skill to which they would challenge him. Then, when they were got"
200,6,19,"together, Alcinous spoke:"
200,6,20,"“Hear me,” said he, “aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,"
200,6,21,"that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be,"
200,6,22,has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East or
200,6,23,West. He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled. Let us
200,6,24,"then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before him;"
200,6,25,"indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain"
200,6,26,of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into
200,6,27,the sea — one that has never yet made a voyage — and man her with two and
200,6,28,fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your
200,6,29,"oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to"
200,6,30,prepare a feast.65 I will find you in everything. I am giving these
200,6,31,"instructions to the young men who will form the crew, for as regards"
200,6,32,"you aldermen and town councillors, you will join me in entertaining our"
200,6,33,"guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have"
200,6,34,Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may
200,6,35,choose to sing about.”
200,6,36,"Alcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a"
200,6,37,servant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty - two picked oarsmen went to
200,6,38,"the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew"
200,6,39,"the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the"
200,6,40,"oars to the thole - pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due"
200,6,41,"course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a"
200,6,42,"little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house"
200,6,43,"of King Alcinous. The out houses,66 yards, and all the precincts were"
200,6,44,filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and
200,6,45,"Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two"
200,6,46,oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent
200,6,47,banquet.
200,6,48,"A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had"
200,6,49,"dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though"
200,6,50,"she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of"
200,6,51,"his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it"
200,6,52,up against a bearing - post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his
200,6,53,"head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He"
200,6,54,"also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup"
200,6,55,of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.
200,6,56,The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before
200,6,57,"them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse"
200,6,58,"inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a"
200,6,59,"matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel"
200,6,60,"between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on"
200,6,61,one another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad
200,6,62,"when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo"
200,6,63,had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to
200,6,64,consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will
200,6,65,of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.
200,6,66,"Thus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head"
200,6,67,"and covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that"
200,6,68,he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from
200,6,69,"his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a"
200,6,70,drink - offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus
200,6,71,"to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again"
200,6,72,drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his
200,6,73,"distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy"
200,6,74,"sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said, “Aldermen and town"
200,6,75,"councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the"
200,6,76,"feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us"
200,6,77,"proceed therefore to the athletic sports, so that our guest on his"
200,6,78,return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all
200,6,79,"other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners.”"
200,6,80,"With these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A"
200,6,81,"servant hung Demodocus’s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the"
200,6,82,"cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief"
200,6,83,men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several
200,6,84,"thousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent"
200,6,85,"competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,"
200,6,86,"Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus,"
200,6,87,and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus
200,6,88,"son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking"
200,6,89,"man among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous,"
200,6,90,"Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also."
200,6,91,The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the
200,6,92,"starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew"
200,6,93,forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he
200,6,94,left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a
200,6,95,couple of mules can plough in a fallow field.67 They then turned to the
200,6,96,"painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best man."
200,6,97,"Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the"
200,6,98,disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous’s son
200,6,99,"Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when"
200,6,100,"they had all been diverted with the games, “Let us ask the stranger"
200,6,101,whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully
200,6,102,"built; his thighs, calves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength,"
200,6,103,"nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is"
200,6,104,"nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no matter how strong"
200,6,105,he is.”
200,6,106,"“You are quite right, Laodamas,” replied Euryalus, “go up to your guest"
200,6,107,and speak to him about it yourself.”
200,6,108,When Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd
200,6,109,"and said to Ulysses, “I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for"
200,6,110,some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of
200,6,111,them — and you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is
200,6,112,nothing that does any one so much credit all his life long as the
200,6,113,showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try
200,6,114,"therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your"
200,6,115,"return home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn"
200,6,116,"into the water, and the crew is found.”"
200,6,117,"Ulysses answered, “Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind"
200,6,118,is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite
200,6,119,"trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king"
200,6,120,and people to further me on my return home.”
200,6,121,"Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said, “I gather, then, that you"
200,6,122,are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in.
200,6,123,I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships
200,6,124,"as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward"
200,6,125,freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be much of the
200,6,126,athlete about you.”
200,6,127,"“For shame, Sir,” answered Ulysses, fiercely, “you are an insolent"
200,6,128,fellow — so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in
200,6,129,"speech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but"
200,6,130,heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms
200,6,131,every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with
200,6,132,"him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever"
200,6,133,"he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god, but"
200,6,134,his good looks are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No
200,6,135,"god could make a finer looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool."
200,6,136,"Your ill - judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are"
200,6,137,"quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed,"
200,6,138,"so long as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of"
200,6,139,"the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have"
200,6,140,gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the
200,6,141,"weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will compete, for your taunts"
200,6,142,have stung me to the quick.”
200,6,143,"So he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,"
200,6,144,"larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians"
200,6,145,"when disc - throwing among themselves.68 Then, swinging it back, he threw"
200,6,146,"it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he"
200,6,147,did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it
200,6,148,"sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been"
200,6,149,"made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place"
200,6,150,"where it had fallen. “A blind man, Sir,” said she, “could easily tell"
200,6,151,your mark by groping for it — it is so far ahead of any other. You may
200,6,152,"make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian can come near"
200,6,153,to such a throw as yours.”
200,6,154,"Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers - on, so"
200,6,155,"he began to speak more pleasantly. “Young men,” said he, “come up to"
200,6,156,"that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even"
200,6,157,"heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I"
200,6,158,"am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what"
200,6,159,"it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him"
200,6,160,"because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one’s own personal"
200,6,161,friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a
200,6,162,"guest to challenge his host’s family at any game, especially when he is"
200,6,163,in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under his own feet if
200,6,164,"he does; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I want to"
200,6,165,have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at
200,6,166,every kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent
200,6,167,archer. In battle I am always the first to bring a man down with my
200,6,168,"arrow, no matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me."
200,6,169,Philoctetes was the only man who could shoot better than I could when
200,6,170,we Achaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel every one
200,6,171,"else in the whole world, of those who still eat bread upon the face of"
200,6,172,"the earth, but I should not like to shoot against the mighty dead, such"
200,6,173,"as Hercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian — men who could shoot against the"
200,6,174,gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his
200,6,175,"end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged"
200,6,176,him as an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can
200,6,177,shoot an arrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am
200,6,178,"afraid some of the Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought"
200,6,179,"down very low at sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still"
200,6,180,weak.”
200,6,181,"They all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, “Sir, we"
200,6,182,"have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which"
200,6,183,"I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having been"
200,6,184,displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one
200,6,185,"of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who"
200,6,186,"knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning,"
200,6,187,and will explain to any one of your chief men who may be dining with
200,6,188,"yourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary"
200,6,189,aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly
200,6,190,"remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly"
200,6,191,fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good
200,6,192,"dinners, music, and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen,"
200,6,193,"warm baths, and good beds, so now, please, some of you who are the best"
200,6,194,"dancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be"
200,6,195,able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as
200,6,196,"sailors, runners, dancers, and minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre"
200,6,197,"at my house, so run some one or other of you and fetch it for him.”"
200,6,198,"On this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king’s house,"
200,6,199,and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was
200,6,200,"their business to manage everything connected with the sports, so they"
200,6,201,made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.
200,6,202,"Presently the servant came back with Demodocus’s lyre, and he took his"
200,6,203,"place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town"
200,6,204,began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the
200,6,205,merry twinkling of their feet.
200,6,206,"Meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how"
200,6,207,they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus
200,6,208,"many presents, and defiled King Vulcan’s marriage bed, so the sun, who"
200,6,209,"saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he"
200,6,210,"heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief,"
200,6,211,"got his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some chains"
200,6,212,"which none could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there"
200,6,213,in that place.69 When he had finished his snare he went into his
200,6,214,bedroom and festooned the bed - posts all over with chains like cobwebs;
200,6,215,he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even
200,6,216,a god could see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had
200,6,217,"spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting"
200,6,218,"out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was"
200,6,219,"the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out, and as"
200,6,220,"soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his house, burning with love"
200,6,221,for Venus.
200,6,222,"Now Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was"
200,6,223,"about sitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took"
200,6,224,"her hand in his own, “Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at"
200,6,225,"home, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is"
200,6,226,barbarous.”
200,6,227,"She was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest,"
200,6,228,whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread
200,6,229,"for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too"
200,6,230,"late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had"
200,6,231,"turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him"
200,6,232,"what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the"
200,6,233,vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the gods.
200,6,234,"“Father Jove,” he cried, “and all you other blessed gods who live for"
200,6,235,"ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I"
200,6,236,will show you. Jove’s daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because
200,6,237,"I am lame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and clean built,"
200,6,238,"whereas I am a cripple — but my parents are to blame for that, not I;"
200,6,239,they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together
200,6,240,asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very
200,6,241,"fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there longer than"
200,6,242,"they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there,"
200,6,243,"however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave"
200,6,244,"him for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.”"
200,6,245,On this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth - encircling
200,6,246,"Neptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the"
200,6,247,goddesses staid at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all
200,6,248,"good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with"
200,6,249,"inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,"
200,6,250,whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:
200,6,251,"“Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how"
200,6,252,"limping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god"
200,6,253,in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.”
200,6,254,"Thus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, “Messenger"
200,6,255,"Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains"
200,6,256,"were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?”"
200,6,257,"“King Apollo,” answered Mercury, “I only wish I might get the chance,"
200,6,258,"though there were three times as many chains — and you might look on, all"
200,6,259,"of you, gods and goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could.”"
200,6,260,"The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune"
200,6,261,"took it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free"
200,6,262,"again. “Let him go,” he cried, “and I will undertake, as you require,"
200,6,263,that he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among
200,6,264,the immortal gods.”
200,6,265,"“Do not,” replied Vulcan, “ask me to do this; a bad man’s bond is bad"
200,6,266,security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go
200,6,267,away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?”
200,6,268,"“Vulcan,” said Neptune, “if Mars goes away without paying his damages,"
200,6,269,"I will pay you myself.” So Vulcan answered, “In this case I cannot and"
200,6,270,must not refuse you.”
200,6,271,"Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were"
200,6,272,"free they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter - loving Venus to"
200,6,273,"Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with"
200,6,274,"burnt offerings. Here the Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil"
200,6,275,"of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her"
200,6,276,in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.
200,6,277,"Thus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were"
200,6,278,charmed as they heard him.
200,6,279,"Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no"
200,6,280,one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had
200,6,281,"made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up"
200,6,282,"towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and"
200,6,283,caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had done
200,6,284,"throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance, and at"
200,6,285,the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one
200,6,286,"another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great"
200,6,287,stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:
200,6,288,"“King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the"
200,6,289,"world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was"
200,6,290,astonished as I saw them.”
200,6,291,"The king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians,"
200,6,292,"“Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of"
200,6,293,singular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he
200,6,294,"may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and"
200,6,295,"counting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean"
200,6,296,"cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in"
200,6,297,"a lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with"
200,6,298,a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology
200,6,299,"and a present too, for he has been rude.”"
200,6,300,"Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and"
200,6,301,"sent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, “King"
200,6,302,"Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He"
200,6,303,"shall have my sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of"
200,6,304,silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into
200,6,305,which it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.”
200,6,306,"As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, “Good"
200,6,307,"luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the"
200,6,308,"winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return,"
200,6,309,"for I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone"
200,6,310,through much hardship.”
200,6,311,"To which Ulysses answered, “Good luck to you too my friend, and may the"
200,6,312,gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you
200,6,313,have given me along with your apology.”
200,6,314,With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards
200,6,315,"sundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of"
200,6,316,the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his
200,6,317,"sons received them, and placed them under their mother’s charge. Then"
200,6,318,Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.
200,6,319,"“Wife,” said he, turning to Queen Arete, “Go, fetch the best chest we"
200,6,320,"have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the"
200,6,321,fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to
200,6,322,the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made
200,6,323,him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that
200,6,324,will follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet — which is of
200,6,325,exquisite workmanship — that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his
200,6,326,"life whenever he makes a drink offering to Jove, or to any of the"
200,6,327,gods.”70
200,6,328,Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast
200,6,329,"as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a"
200,6,330,"clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became"
200,6,331,hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.71 Meanwhile
200,6,332,"Arete brought a magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it she"
200,6,333,packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the
200,6,334,Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from
200,6,335,"Alcinous, and said to Ulysses:"
200,6,336,"“See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for"
200,6,337,fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your
200,6,338,ship.” 72
200,6,339,When Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast
200,6,340,with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper
200,6,341,servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad
200,6,342,"of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he"
200,6,343,"left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had"
200,6,344,taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the
200,6,345,"servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him"
200,6,346,"a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests"
200,6,347,who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the
200,6,348,"bearing - posts supporting the roof of the cloister, and admired him as"
200,6,349,"she saw him pass. “Farewell stranger,” said she, “do not forget me when"
200,6,350,"you are safe at home again, for it is to me first that you owe a ransom"
200,6,351,for having saved your life.”
200,6,352,"And Ulysses said, “Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove the"
200,6,353,"mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall I"
200,6,354,"bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved"
200,6,355,me.”
200,6,356,"When he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was"
200,6,357,"then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the"
200,6,358,"favourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near"
200,6,359,"one of the bearing - posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean"
200,6,360,against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of
200,6,361,"fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant,"
200,6,362,“Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it; for
200,6,363,all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less;
200,6,364,"bards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse"
200,6,365,teaches them their songs and loves them.”
200,6,366,"The servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who took"
200,6,367,it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good
200,6,368,"things that were before them, and as soon as they had had to eat and"
200,6,369,"drink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, “Demodocus, there is no one in the"
200,6,370,world whom I admire more than I do you. You must have studied under the
200,6,371,"Muse, Jove’s daughter, and under Apollo, so accurately do you sing the"
200,6,372,return of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you
200,6,373,"were not there yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who"
200,6,374,"was. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse"
200,6,375,"which Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got"
200,6,376,by stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who
200,6,377,afterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will
200,6,378,tell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.”
200,6,379,The bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some
200,6,380,"of the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others,"
200,6,381,"hidden within the horse,73 were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan"
200,6,382,place of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into
200,6,383,"their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it,"
200,6,384,and were in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for
200,6,385,breaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top
200,6,386,"of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the"
200,6,387,precipice; while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering
200,6,388,and propitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the
200,6,389,"end, for the city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which"
200,6,390,were all the bravest of the Argives waiting to bring death and
200,6,391,destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans
200,6,392,"issued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their"
200,6,393,ambuscade. He sang how they overran the city hither and thither and
200,6,394,"ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus"
200,6,395,to the house of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most
200,6,396,"furiously, nevertheless by Minerva’s help he was victorious."
200,6,397,"All this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his"
200,6,398,cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws
200,6,399,herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city
200,6,400,"and people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She"
200,6,401,screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for
200,6,402,"breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back"
200,6,403,"and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labour and"
200,6,404,"sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks — even so piteously did"
200,6,405,"Ulysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except"
200,6,406,"Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs"
200,6,407,"that he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:"
200,6,408,"“Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease"
200,6,409,"his song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it. From"
200,6,410,"the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing, our"
200,6,411,guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in
200,6,412,"great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy"
200,6,413,"ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should"
200,6,414,"be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we"
200,6,415,"are making with so much good will are wholly in his honour, and any one"
200,6,416,with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to
200,6,417,treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.
200,6,418,"“Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor"
200,6,419,reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more
200,6,420,polite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your
200,6,421,"father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which you were"
200,6,422,"known among your neighbours and fellow - citizens. There is no one,"
200,6,423,"neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name whatever, for"
200,6,424,people’s fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.
200,6,425,"Tell me also your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape"
200,6,426,their purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have
200,6,427,no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of other nations
200,6,428,"have, but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are"
200,6,429,thinking about and want; they know all the cities and countries in the
200,6,430,"whole world, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is"
200,6,431,"covered with mist and cloud, so that there is no danger of being"
200,6,432,wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do remember hearing my father
200,6,433,say that Neptune was angry with us for being too easy - going in the
200,6,434,matter of giving people escorts. He said that one of these days he
200,6,435,should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted
200,6,436,"some one,74 and bury our city under a high mountain. This is what my"
200,6,437,"father used to say, but whether the god will carry out his threat or no"
200,6,438,is a matter which he will decide for himself.
200,6,439,"“And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and"
200,6,440,in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples
200,6,441,"themselves, and of their cities — who were hostile, savage and"
200,6,442,"uncivilised, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us"
200,6,443,also why you are made so unhappy on hearing about the return of the
200,6,444,"Argive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them"
200,6,445,their misfortunes in order that future generations might have something
200,6,446,to sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife’s when you
200,6,447,were before Troy? a son - in - law or father - in - law — which are the nearest
200,6,448,relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood? or was it some
200,6,449,brave and kindly - natured comrade — for a good friend is as dear to a man
200,6,450,as his own brother?”
200,7,1,"ULYSSES DECLARES HIMSELF AND BEGINS HIS STORY —  - THE CICONS, LOTOPHAGI,"
200,7,2,AND CYCLOPES.
200,7,3,"And Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard"
200,7,4,with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or
200,7,5,"more delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the"
200,7,6,"guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread"
200,7,7,"and meats, and the cup - bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every"
200,7,8,"man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however,"
200,7,9,"since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my"
200,7,10,"own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor"
200,7,11,"yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has"
200,7,12,been laid heavily upon me.
200,7,13,"“Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and"
200,7,14,"one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though"
200,7,15,"I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes,"
200,7,16,"renowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my fame"
200,7,17,"ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain"
200,7,18,"called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a"
200,7,19,"group of islands very near to one another — Dulichium, Same, and the"
200,7,20,"wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest"
200,7,21,"up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it"
200,7,22,"towards dawn.75 It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my"
200,7,23,eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso
200,7,24,"kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as did also"
200,7,25,the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them
200,7,26,"persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man than his own country"
200,7,27,"and his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a foreign"
200,7,28,"country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it."
200,7,29,"Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by"
200,7,30,Jove’s will I met with on my return from Troy.
200,7,31,"“When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which is"
200,7,32,the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people to
200,7,33,"the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided"
200,7,34,"equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I"
200,7,35,"then said that we had better make off at once, but my men very"
200,7,36,"foolishly would not obey me, so they staid there drinking much wine and"
200,7,37,killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the
200,7,38,Cicons cried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were
200,7,39,"more in number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of"
200,7,40,"war, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the"
200,7,41,"occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as"
200,7,42,"leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us, so"
200,7,43,"that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships,"
200,7,44,and the hosts aimed their bronze - shod spears at one another.76 So long
200,7,45,"as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held our own against"
200,7,46,"them, though they were more in number than we; but as the sun went"
200,7,47,"down, towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Cicons got the"
200,7,48,"better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship we had; so"
200,7,49,we got away with those that were left.
200,7,50,"“Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have"
200,7,51,"escaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till we"
200,7,52,had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by the
200,7,53,hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it
200,7,54,"blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and"
200,7,55,night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the
200,7,56,"gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters, so we took"
200,7,57,"them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the"
200,7,58,land. There we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from
200,7,59,"toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we again"
200,7,60,"raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and"
200,7,61,steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed
200,7,62,had not the North wind and the currents been against me as I was
200,7,63,"doubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by the island of"
200,7,64,Cythera.
200,7,65,“I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the
200,7,66,"sea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus - eaters, who"
200,7,67,live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take
200,7,68,"in fresh water, and our crews got their mid - day meal on the shore near"
200,7,69,the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my company to
200,7,70,"see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had a"
200,7,71,"third man under them. They started at once, and went about among the"
200,7,72,"Lotus - eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of the lotus,"
200,7,73,which was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about
200,7,74,"home, and did not even want to go back and say what had happened to"
200,7,75,"them, but were for staying and munching lotus77 with the Lotus - eaters"
200,7,76,"without thinking further of their return; nevertheless, though they"
200,7,77,wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships and made them fast under
200,7,78,"the benches. Then I told the rest to go on board at once, lest any of"
200,7,79,"them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting to get home, so"
200,7,80,they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.
200,7,81,"“We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land of"
200,7,82,the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant nor
200,7,83,"plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and"
200,7,84,"grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes"
200,7,85,yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no
200,7,86,"laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of"
200,7,87,"high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and they take no"
200,7,88,account of their neighbours.
200,7,89,“Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite
200,7,90,"close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is over - run"
200,7,91,"with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never"
200,7,92,disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen — who as a rule will suffer so
200,7,93,"much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices — do not go there,"
200,7,94,"nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness"
200,7,95,"untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no living thing upon it"
200,7,96,"but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who"
200,7,97,"could make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city,"
200,7,98,or sail over the sea to one another’s country as people who have ships
200,7,99,"can do; if they had had these they would have colonised the island,78"
200,7,100,"for it is a very good one, and would yield everything in due season."
200,7,101,"There are meadows that in some places come right down to the sea shore,"
200,7,102,well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do there
200,7,103,"excellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would always"
200,7,104,"yield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is deep. There is a good"
200,7,105,"harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be"
200,7,106,"moored, but all one has to do is to beach one’s vessel and stay there"
200,7,107,till the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of
200,7,108,"the harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and"
200,7,109,there are poplars growing all round it.
200,7,110,"“Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have"
200,7,111,"brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist"
200,7,112,hung all round our ships;79 the moon was hidden behind a mass of clouds
200,7,113,"so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked for it, nor"
200,7,114,were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore before we
200,7,115,"found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had beached the"
200,7,116,"ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped upon the beach"
200,7,117,till daybreak.
200,7,118,"“When the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn appeared, we admired the"
200,7,119,"island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove’s daughters"
200,7,120,roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On
200,7,121,"this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and"
200,7,122,dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven
200,7,123,"sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got"
200,7,124,"nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to"
200,7,125,"the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, and we had plenty"
200,7,126,"of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we"
200,7,127,"sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out. While we"
200,7,128,were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the
200,7,129,"Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires."
200,7,130,We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their
200,7,131,"sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we"
200,7,132,"camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council."
200,7,133,"“‘Stay here, my brave fellows,’ said I, ‘all the rest of you, while I"
200,7,134,go with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if they
200,7,135,"are uncivilised savages, or a hospitable and humane race.’"
200,7,136,"“I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers;"
200,7,137,so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars. When
200,7,138,"we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff"
200,7,139,"near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a"
200,7,140,"station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large"
200,7,141,"yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built into the ground"
200,7,142,and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster
200,7,143,who was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He would have
200,7,144,"nothing to do with other people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was"
200,7,145,"a horrid creature, not like a human being at all, but resembling rather"
200,7,146,some crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high
200,7,147,mountain.
200,7,148,"“I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all"
200,7,149,"but the twelve best among them, who were to go along with myself. I"
200,7,150,also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by
200,7,151,"Maron, son of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron god of"
200,7,152,"Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we"
200,7,153,"were sacking the city we respected him, and spared his life, as also"
200,7,154,his wife and child; so he made me some presents of great value — seven
200,7,155,"talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet"
200,7,156,"wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid"
200,7,157,"in the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife, and one"
200,7,158,housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of
200,7,159,"wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing - bowl was so exquisite that"
200,7,160,it was impossible to refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with
200,7,161,"this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind"
200,7,162,misgave me that I might have to deal with some savage who would be of
200,7,163,"great strength, and would respect neither right nor law."
200,7,164,"“We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went"
200,7,165,inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese - racks were
200,7,166,"loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could"
200,7,167,"hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets,"
200,7,168,then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones80
200,7,169,"all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels,"
200,7,170,"bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimming with whey."
200,7,171,"When they saw all this, my men begged me to let them first steal some"
200,7,172,"cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; they would then return,"
200,7,173,"drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with"
200,7,174,them. It would have been indeed better if we had done so but I would
200,7,175,"not listen to them, for I wanted to see the owner himself, in the hope"
200,7,176,"that he might give me a present. When, however, we saw him my poor men"
200,7,177,found him ill to deal with.
200,7,178,"“We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others of"
200,7,179,"them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his"
200,7,180,"sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood"
200,7,181,"to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise"
200,7,182,on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far
200,7,183,"end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as"
200,7,184,"the she - goats that he was going to milk, leaving the males, both rams"
200,7,185,"and he - goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the"
200,7,186,mouth of the cave — so huge that two and twenty strong four - wheeled
200,7,187,waggons would not be enough to draw it from its place against the
200,7,188,"doorway. When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats,"
200,7,189,"all in due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He"
200,7,190,"curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the"
200,7,191,other half he poured into bowls that he might drink it for his supper.
200,7,192,"When he had got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then"
200,7,193,"caught sight of us, whereon he said:"
200,7,194,"“‘Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do"
200,7,195,"you sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and"
200,7,196,every man’s hand against you?’
200,7,197,“We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous
200,7,198,"form, but I managed to say, ‘We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,"
200,7,199,"but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far"
200,7,200,"out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who"
200,7,201,"has won infinite renown throughout the whole world, by sacking so great"
200,7,202,a city and killing so many people. We therefore humbly pray you to show
200,7,203,"us some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors"
200,7,204,"may reasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven,"
200,7,205,"for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes all respectable travellers"
200,7,206,"under his protection, for he is the avenger of all suppliants and"
200,7,207,foreigners in distress.’
200,7,208,"“To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, ‘Stranger,’ said he, ‘you"
200,7,209,"are a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me,"
200,7,210,"indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do"
200,7,211,"not care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so"
200,7,212,much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your
200,7,213,"companions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for"
200,7,214,doing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came
200,7,215,"on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the"
200,7,216,land?’
200,7,217,"“He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught in"
200,7,218,"that way, so I answered with a lie; ‘Neptune,’ said I, ‘sent my ship on"
200,7,219,"to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were"
200,7,220,"driven on to them from the open sea, but I and those who are with me"
200,7,221,escaped the jaws of death.’
200,7,222,"“The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a"
200,7,223,sudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down
200,7,224,upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed
200,7,225,"upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore"
200,7,226,them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a
200,7,227,"lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without"
200,7,228,"leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to"
200,7,229,"heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to"
200,7,230,"do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed"
200,7,231,"down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched"
200,7,232,"himself full length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep."
200,7,233,"I was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into"
200,7,234,"his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be"
200,7,235,"lost, for we should never be able to shift the stone which the monster"
200,7,236,had put in front of the door. So we stayed sobbing and sighing where we
200,7,237,were till morning came.
200,7,238,"“When the child of morning, rosy - fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit"
200,7,239,"his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let"
200,7,240,each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his
200,7,241,"work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his"
200,7,242,"morning’s meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone"
200,7,243,"away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back"
200,7,244,again — as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a
200,7,245,"quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried"
200,7,246,"‘Shoo, shoo,’ after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I"
200,7,247,was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself
200,7,248,with glory.
200,7,249,“In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows: The
200,7,250,Cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it
200,7,251,"was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for a"
200,7,252,staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could only
200,7,253,compare it to the mast of a twenty - oared merchant vessel of large
200,7,254,"burden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club"
200,7,255,and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and
200,7,256,"told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do,"
200,7,257,"and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire"
200,7,258,"to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was"
200,7,259,"lying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of"
200,7,260,them should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the
200,7,261,monster’s eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom
200,7,262,"I should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch"
200,7,263,"came back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into the cave — this"
200,7,264,"time driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I"
200,7,265,"suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him"
200,7,266,to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the
200,7,267,"door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and"
200,7,268,then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all
200,7,269,"this work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off"
200,7,270,them. So I went up to him with an ivy - wood bowl of black wine in my
200,7,271,hands:
200,7,272,"“‘Look here, Cyclops,’ said I, you have been eating a great deal of"
200,7,273,"man’s flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what"
200,7,274,kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a
200,7,275,"drink - offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and"
200,7,276,"further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping and"
200,7,277,raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed of yourself; how can
200,7,278,you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this
200,7,279,way?’
200,7,280,“He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of
200,7,281,"the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. ‘Be so kind,’ he"
200,7,282,"said, ‘as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want"
200,7,283,to make you a present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even
200,7,284,"in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but"
200,7,285,this drinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.’
200,7,286,"“I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,"
200,7,287,"and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I"
200,7,288,"saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as"
200,7,289,"I could: ‘Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me,"
200,7,290,"therefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what"
200,7,291,my father and mother and my friends have always called me.’
200,7,292,"“But the cruel wretch said, ‘Then I will eat all Noman’s comrades"
200,7,293,"before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the"
200,7,294,present that I will make him.’
200,7,295,"“As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground."
200,7,296,His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon
200,7,297,"him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets"
200,7,298,"of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk."
200,7,299,"Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and"
200,7,300,encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint - hearted. When the
200,7,301,"wood, green though it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the"
200,7,302,"fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had"
200,7,303,filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam
200,7,304,"into the monster’s eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept"
200,7,305,turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship’s
200,7,306,"plank with an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on"
200,7,307,turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam
200,7,308,"into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked"
200,7,309,"it round and round, so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded"
200,7,310,"his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the"
200,7,311,fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to
200,7,312,temper it — for it is this that gives strength to the iron — and it makes a
200,7,313,"great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops’ eye hiss round the"
200,7,314,"beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We"
200,7,315,"ran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore"
200,7,316,"from his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain,"
200,7,317,shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak
200,7,318,headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave
200,7,319,"when they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with him."
200,7,320,"“‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that you make such a noise,"
200,7,321,"breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able"
200,7,322,to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is
200,7,323,trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?’
200,7,324,"“But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, ‘Noman is killing"
200,7,325,me by fraud; no man is killing me by force.’
200,7,326,"“‘Then,’ said they, ‘if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when"
200,7,327,"Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray"
200,7,328,to your father Neptune.’
200,7,329,"“Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my"
200,7,330,"clever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,"
200,7,331,felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the
200,7,332,door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it
200,7,333,"to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be"
200,7,334,foolish enough to attempt this.
200,7,335,“As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own
200,7,336,"life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who"
200,7,337,"knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In"
200,7,338,the end I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were
200,7,339,"well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them"
200,7,340,"noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which the"
200,7,341,wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man under the middle
200,7,342,"sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that there were"
200,7,343,three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any
200,7,344,"of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in"
200,7,345,"the thick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece,"
200,7,346,"face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the time."
200,7,347,"“Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but"
200,7,348,"when the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep"
200,7,349,"hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens"
200,7,350,"waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their"
200,7,351,master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they
200,7,352,"stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were"
200,7,353,"underneath their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy"
200,7,354,"with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self, Polyphemus laid"
200,7,355,hold of it and said:
200,7,356,"“‘My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this"
200,7,357,"morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the"
200,7,358,"mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are"
200,7,359,the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is
200,7,360,"it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because"
200,7,361,that wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and
200,7,362,blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and
200,7,363,"talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash"
200,7,364,his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should
200,7,365,thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no - good Noman has done
200,7,366,me.’
200,7,367,"“As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way"
200,7,368,"out from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram’s belly,"
200,7,369,"and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by"
200,7,370,constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them
200,7,371,down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who
200,7,372,"had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed."
200,7,373,"However, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to"
200,7,374,"hush their crying, and told them to get all the sheep on board at once"
200,7,375,"and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their places, and smote"
200,7,376,"the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my"
200,7,377,"voice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops."
200,7,378,"“‘Cyclops,’ said I, ‘you should have taken better measure of your man"
200,7,379,"before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your"
200,7,380,visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would
200,7,381,"find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.’"
200,7,382,"“He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from"
200,7,383,"off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that it"
200,7,384,was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder.81 The sea quaked
200,7,385,"as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us"
200,7,386,"back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But I"
200,7,387,"snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my men"
200,7,388,"by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they"
200,7,389,"laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I"
200,7,390,"was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of"
200,7,391,me to hold my tongue.
200,7,392,"“‘Do not,’ they exclaimed, ‘be mad enough to provoke this savage"
200,7,393,creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us
200,7,394,"back again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of"
200,7,395,us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have
200,7,396,pounded our heads and our ship’s timbers into a jelly with the rugged
200,7,397,"rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.’"
200,7,398,"“But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage,"
200,7,399,"‘Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and"
200,7,400,"spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of"
200,7,401,"Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.’"
200,7,402,"“On this he groaned, and cried out, ‘Alas, alas, then the old prophecy"
200,7,403,"about me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a man"
200,7,404,"both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was an"
200,7,405,"excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he"
200,7,406,"grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day, and"
200,7,407,said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all
200,7,408,"along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength,"
200,7,409,"whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has"
200,7,410,managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come
200,7,411,"here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents to show my"
200,7,412,"hospitality, and urge Neptune to help you forward on your journey — for"
200,7,413,"Neptune and I are father and son. He, if he so will, shall heal me,"
200,7,414,which no one else neither god nor man can do.’
200,7,415,"“Then I said, ‘I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and"
200,7,416,"sending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more"
200,7,417,than Neptune to cure that eye of yours.’
200,7,418,"“On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed,"
200,7,419,"saying, ‘Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten"
200,7,420,"son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must"
200,7,421,"get back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight"
200,7,422,after losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man’s ship
200,7,423,and find trouble in his house.’82
200,7,424,"“Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a"
200,7,425,"rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with"
200,7,426,"prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a"
200,7,427,little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock
200,7,428,"fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on"
200,7,429,our way towards the shore of the island.
200,7,430,“When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our
200,7,431,"ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our"
200,7,432,return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the
200,7,433,"sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops’ sheep, and divided them"
200,7,434,equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain. As for
200,7,435,"the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share;"
200,7,436,"so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to"
200,7,437,"Jove, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only"
200,7,438,thought how he might destroy both my ships and my comrades.
200,7,439,“Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted
200,7,440,"our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on"
200,7,441,"dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning rosy - fingered"
200,7,442,"Dawn appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they"
200,7,443,took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so we sailed
200,7,444,"on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we"
200,7,445,had lost our comrades.
200,7,446,BOOK X
200,7,447,"AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE."
200,7,448,“Thence we went on to the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of
200,7,449,"Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it"
200,7,450,"were) upon the sea,83 iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus"
200,7,451,"has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry the"
200,7,452,"daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,"
200,7,453,feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long
200,7,454,the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats
200,7,455,"till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their"
200,7,456,"well made bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets. These"
200,7,457,were the people among whom we had now come.
200,7,458,“Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the
200,7,459,"time about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I"
200,7,460,"told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must"
200,7,461,"go, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of"
200,7,462,"difficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a"
200,7,463,"prime ox - hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up"
200,7,464,"in the hide as in a sack — for Jove had made him captain over the winds,"
200,7,465,and he could stir or still each one of them according to his own
200,7,466,pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly
200,7,467,with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side - wind could blow
200,7,468,from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone let
200,7,469,"blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were lost through"
200,7,470,our own folly.
200,7,471,"“Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native"
200,7,472,land showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the
200,7,473,"stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light"
200,7,474,"sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we"
200,7,475,might get home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among
200,7,476,"themselves, and said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack"
200,7,477,"that Aeolus had given me. ‘Bless my heart,’ would one turn to his"
200,7,478,"neighbour, saying, ‘how this man gets honoured and makes friends to"
200,7,479,whatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking
200,7,480,"home from Troy, while we, who have travelled just as far as he has,"
200,7,481,come back with hands as empty as we set out with — and now Aeolus has
200,7,482,"given him ever so much more. Quick — let us see what it all is, and how"
200,7,483,much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave him.’
200,7,484,"“Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,"
200,7,485,whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried
200,7,486,"us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and"
200,7,487,knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make
200,7,488,"the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the"
200,7,489,"ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our"
200,7,490,fleet back to the Aeolian island.
200,7,491,"“When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard by"
200,7,492,the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men
200,7,493,"and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting"
200,7,494,with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the
200,7,495,"threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, ‘Ulysses,"
200,7,496,what brings you here? What god has been ill - treating you? We took great
200,7,497,"pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever it was"
200,7,498,that you wanted to go to.’
200,7,499,"“Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, ‘My men have undone"
200,7,500,"me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this"
200,7,501,"mischief, for you can if you will.’"
200,7,502,"“I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their"
200,7,503,"father answered, ‘Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the"
200,7,504,"island; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you"
200,7,505,come here as one abhorred of heaven.’ And with these words he sent me
200,7,506,sorrowing from his door.
200,7,507,“Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and
200,7,508,"fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six"
200,7,509,"days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the"
200,7,510,"rocky stronghold of Lamus — Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians,"
200,7,511,where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]
200,7,512,salutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last
200,7,513,answers the salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep
200,7,514,"might earn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a"
200,7,515,"shepherd, for they work much the same by night as they do by day.84"
200,7,516,“When we reached the harbour we found it land - locked under steep
200,7,517,"cliffs, with a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took"
200,7,518,"all their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for"
200,7,519,"there was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always"
200,7,520,"dead calm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the"
200,7,521,"very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but"
200,7,522,"could see no sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising"
200,7,523,from the ground. So I sent two of my company with an attendant to find
200,7,524,out what sort of people the inhabitants were.
200,7,525,“The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the
200,7,526,"people draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till"
200,7,527,"presently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water,"
200,7,528,and who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going
200,7,529,"to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their water, and"
200,7,530,"when my men had come close up to her, they asked her who the king of"
200,7,531,"that country might be, and over what kind of people he ruled; so she"
200,7,532,"directed them to her father’s house, but when they got there they found"
200,7,533,"his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were"
200,7,534,horrified at the sight of her.
200,7,535,"“She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly,"
200,7,536,"and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them,"
200,7,537,"and began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other"
200,7,538,two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates
200,7,539,"raised a hue - and - cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians"
200,7,540,"sprang up from every quarter — ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at"
200,7,541,"us from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard the"
200,7,542,"horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the"
200,7,543,"death cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes"
200,7,544,and took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing my men
200,7,545,"within the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and"
200,7,546,told my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare like
200,7,547,"the rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful enough"
200,7,548,when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at
200,7,549,us. As for the others there was not one of them left.
200,7,550,"“Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we had"
200,7,551,"lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe lives — a"
200,7,552,great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aeetes — for
200,7,553,"they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter to Oceanus."
200,7,554,"We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word, for some god"
200,7,555,"guided us thither, and having landed we lay there for two days and two"
200,7,556,"nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day"
200,7,557,"came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to"
200,7,558,"reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork, or"
200,7,559,hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high look - out I
200,7,560,espied the smoke of Circe’s house rising upwards amid a dense forest of
200,7,561,"trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I"
200,7,562,"would not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I deemed it"
200,7,563,"best to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some"
200,7,564,of them instead of going myself.
200,7,565,“When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my
200,7,566,"solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my"
200,7,567,path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the
200,7,568,"river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him"
200,7,569,in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean
200,7,570,"through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of"
200,7,571,"him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and"
200,7,572,laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them
200,7,573,"into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four"
200,7,574,feet of the noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my
200,7,575,"neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag"
200,7,576,"was much too big for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder,"
200,7,577,"steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship,"
200,7,578,I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. ‘Look
200,7,579,"here my friends,’ said I, ‘we are not going to die so much before our"
200,7,580,"time after all, and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have"
200,7,581,got something to eat and drink on board.’ On this they uncovered their
200,7,582,"heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a"
200,7,583,"splendid fellow. Then, when they had feasted their eyes upon him"
200,7,584,"sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook him for dinner."
200,7,585,“Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed
200,7,586,"there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and it"
200,7,587,"came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning,"
200,7,588,"rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, ‘My friends,"
200,7,589,we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no
200,7,590,"idea where the sun either sets or rises,85 so that we do not even know"
200,7,591,"East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must try and"
200,7,592,"find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as I could"
200,7,593,"this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to the horizon; it"
200,7,594,"lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out of a thick"
200,7,595,forest of trees.’
200,7,596,"“Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had"
200,7,597,"been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre"
200,7,598,"Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing"
200,7,599,"to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a"
200,7,600,"captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while I took"
200,7,601,"command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot"
200,7,602,"fell upon Eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty - two men, and they"
200,7,603,"wept, as also did we who were left behind."
200,7,604,"“When they reached Circe’s house they found it built of cut stones, on"
200,7,605,"a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There"
200,7,606,were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it — poor
200,7,607,bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged
200,7,608,"into subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great"
200,7,609,"tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against"
200,7,610,them.86 As hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming
200,7,611,from dinner — for they know he will bring them something — even so did
200,7,612,"these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the"
200,7,613,men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.
200,7,614,"Presently they reached the gates of the goddess’s house, and as they"
200,7,615,"stood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as"
200,7,616,"she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such"
200,7,617,"dazzling colours as no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites,"
200,7,618,"whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men, said, ‘There"
200,7,619,is some one inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the
200,7,620,"whole place resounds with it, let us call her and see whether she is"
200,7,621,woman or goddess.’
200,7,622,"“They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them"
200,7,623,"enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who"
200,7,624,suspected mischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her
200,7,625,"house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with"
200,7,626,"cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked"
200,7,627,"poisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she"
200,7,628,"turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her"
200,7,629,"pig - styes. They were like pigs — head, hair, and all, and they grunted"
200,7,630,"just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they"
200,7,631,remembered everything.
200,7,632,"“Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some"
200,7,633,"acorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to"
200,7,634,tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with
200,7,635,dismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so;
200,7,636,"his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at last"
200,7,637,"we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the"
200,7,638,others.
200,7,639,"“‘We went,’ said he, ‘as you told us, through the forest, and in the"
200,7,640,middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place
200,7,641,"that could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a"
200,7,642,"goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to"
200,7,643,"her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and"
200,7,644,invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they followed
200,7,645,"her into the house, but I staid where I was, for I thought there might"
200,7,646,"be some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more, for not one of"
200,7,647,"them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching for them.’"
200,7,648,“Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also
200,7,649,"took my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the"
200,7,650,"way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously,"
200,7,651,"saying, ‘Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for"
200,7,652,"I know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even return"
200,7,653,alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with
200,7,654,"the few that are left us, for we may still save our lives.’"
200,7,655,"“‘Stay where you are, then,’ answered I, ‘eating and drinking at the"
200,7,656,"ship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.’"
200,7,657,“With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the
200,7,658,"charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe, I"
200,7,659,"met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the"
200,7,660,hey - day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his
200,7,661,"face. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, ‘My"
200,7,662,"poor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top, alone"
200,7,663,"and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe’s pigstyes,"
200,7,664,like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not fancy that
200,7,665,you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back and
200,7,666,"will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will"
200,7,667,"protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which"
200,7,668,"is one of great virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe’s"
200,7,669,"house, it will be a talisman to you against every kind of mischief."
200,7,670,“‘And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try
200,7,671,"to practice upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she"
200,7,672,"will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to"
200,7,673,"charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you will"
200,7,674,prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it. When
200,7,675,"Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as"
200,7,676,"though you were going to kill her. She will then be frightened, and"
200,7,677,will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank
200,7,678,"refuse her, for you want her to set your companions free, and to take"
200,7,679,"good care also of yourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all"
200,7,680,"the blessed gods that she will plot no further mischief against you, or"
200,7,681,else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for
200,7,682,nothing.’
200,7,683,“As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it
200,7,684,"was like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk;"
200,7,685,"the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods"
200,7,686,can do whatever they like.
200,7,687,“Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island;
200,7,688,"but I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with"
200,7,689,care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and
200,7,690,"called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down, opened"
200,7,691,"the door, and asked me to come in; so I followed her — much troubled in"
200,7,692,"my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver,"
200,7,693,"there was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a"
200,7,694,"golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for she meant me"
200,7,695,"mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it without its"
200,7,696,"charming me, she struck me with her wand. ‘There now,’ she cried, ‘be"
200,7,697,"off to the pigstye, and make your lair with the rest of them.’"
200,7,698,"“But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,"
200,7,699,"whereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke"
200,7,700,"piteously, saying, ‘Who and whence are you? from what place and people"
200,7,701,have you come? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?
200,7,702,Never yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I
200,7,703,gave you; you must be spell - proof; surely you can be none other than
200,7,704,"the bold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here some day"
200,7,705,with his ship while on his way home from Troy; so be it then; sheathe
200,7,706,"your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends and learn to"
200,7,707,trust each other.’
200,7,708,"“And I answered, ‘Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with you"
200,7,709,when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now that you
200,7,710,"have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to"
200,7,711,"bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall"
200,7,712,certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take
200,7,713,your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.’
200,7,714,"“So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed her"
200,7,715,oath then I went to bed with her.
200,7,716,"“Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their"
200,7,717,"work. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the"
200,7,718,holy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair
200,7,719,"purple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another"
200,7,720,"brought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets of"
200,7,721,gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put
200,7,722,"golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth brought in water and set"
200,7,723,it to boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted.
200,7,724,"When the water in the cauldron was boiling,87 she poured cold into it"
200,7,725,"till it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began"
200,7,726,"washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders, to take the"
200,7,727,tire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me
200,7,728,"and anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and"
200,7,729,led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a
200,7,730,footstool also under my feet. A maid servant then brought me water in a
200,7,731,beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash
200,7,732,"my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant"
200,7,733,brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was in the
200,7,734,"house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without"
200,7,735,"heeding what was before me, still moody and suspicious."
200,7,736,"“When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief,"
200,7,737,"she came to me and said, ‘Ulysses, why do you sit like that as though"
200,7,738,"you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and"
200,7,739,"drink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for I"
200,7,740,have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.’
200,7,741,"“And I said, ‘Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think"
200,7,742,of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his
200,7,743,"friends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink, you"
200,7,744,must free my men and bring them to me that I may see them with my own
200,7,745,eyes.’
200,7,746,“When I had said this she went straight through the court with her wand
200,7,747,in her hand and opened the pigstye doors. My men came out like so many
200,7,748,"prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among them and"
200,7,749,"anointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad"
200,7,750,"drug had given them fell off, and they became men again, younger than"
200,7,751,"they were before, and much taller and better looking. They knew me at"
200,7,752,"once, seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the"
200,7,753,"whole house was filled with the sound of their halloa - ballooing, and"
200,7,754,"Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said,"
200,7,755,"‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where you"
200,7,756,"have left your ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide all"
200,7,757,"your ship’s gear and property in some cave, and come back here with"
200,7,758,your men.’
200,7,759,"“I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the men"
200,7,760,at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the
200,7,761,silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out
200,7,762,"and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home to be"
200,7,763,"milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds"
200,7,764,with their lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though they had got
200,7,765,"back to their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred."
200,7,766,"‘Sir,’ said the affectionate creatures, ‘we are as glad to see you back"
200,7,767,as though we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us all about the
200,7,768,fate of our comrades.’
200,7,769,"“I spoke comfortingly to them and said, ‘We must draw our ship on to"
200,7,770,"the land, and hide the ship’s gear with all our property in some cave;"
200,7,771,"then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe’s house, where"
200,7,772,you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great
200,7,773,abundance.’
200,7,774,"“On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried"
200,7,775,"to hold them back and said, ‘Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will"
200,7,776,"become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, who"
200,7,777,"will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to"
200,7,778,keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our
200,7,779,"comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It was all"
200,7,780,through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.’
200,7,781,“When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen
200,7,782,blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of his
200,7,783,being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him and
200,7,784,"said, ‘Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and mind the"
200,7,785,"ship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe’s house.’"
200,7,786,"“On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after"
200,7,787,"all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand"
200,7,788,that I had given him.
200,7,789,“Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind
200,7,790,were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them
200,7,791,"woollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all"
200,7,792,comfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other
200,7,793,"face to face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud"
200,7,794,"till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said,"
200,7,795,"‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men to leave off crying; I"
200,7,796,"know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have"
200,7,797,"fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so"
200,7,798,"stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and"
200,7,799,hearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you are
200,7,800,weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking of the
200,7,801,"hardships you have suffered during your travels, so that you have no"
200,7,802,more cheerfulness left in you.’
200,7,803,“Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole
200,7,804,twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But
200,7,805,when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had
200,7,806,"come round, my men called me apart and said, ‘Sir, it is time you began"
200,7,807,"to think about going home, if so be you are to be spared to see your"
200,7,808,house and native country at all.’
200,7,809,“Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day
200,7,810,"to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but"
200,7,811,when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down
200,7,812,"to sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed"
200,7,813,"with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened to what"
200,7,814,"I had got to say. ‘Circe,’ said I, ‘please to keep the promise you made"
200,7,815,me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get back and so
200,7,816,"do my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon"
200,7,817,as ever your back is turned.’
200,7,818,"“And the goddess answered, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall"
200,7,819,"none of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is"
200,7,820,another journey which you have got to take before you can sail
200,7,821,homewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to
200,7,822,"consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias, whose reason"
200,7,823,is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding
200,7,824,"even in death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.’"
200,7,825,"“I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would"
200,7,826,"gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently"
200,7,827,"when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, ‘And who"
200,7,828,shall guide me upon this voyage — for the house of Hades is a port that
200,7,829,no ship can reach.’
200,7,830,"“‘You will want no guide,’ she answered; ‘raise your mast, set your"
200,7,831,"white sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of"
200,7,832,"itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will"
200,7,833,reach the fertile shore of Proserpine’s country with its groves of tall
200,7,834,poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your
200,7,835,"ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of"
200,7,836,Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon
200,7,837,"and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron,"
200,7,838,"and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers run"
200,7,839,into one another.
200,7,840,"“‘When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a"
200,7,841,"cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a"
200,7,842,"drink - offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then"
200,7,843,"wine, and in the third place water — sprinkling white barley meal over"
200,7,844,the whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble
200,7,845,"ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will"
200,7,846,"sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load the"
200,7,847,pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that
200,7,848,"Teiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all"
200,7,849,your flocks.
200,7,850,"“‘When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer"
200,7,851,"them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but"
200,7,852,yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the
200,7,853,"river. On this, many dead men’s ghosts will come to you, and you must"
200,7,854,"tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just killed, and"
200,7,855,offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to
200,7,856,"Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as to prevent any"
200,7,857,other poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias
200,7,858,shall have answered your questions. The seer will presently come to
200,7,859,"you, and will tell you about your voyage — what stages you are to make,"
200,7,860,and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home.’
200,7,861,"“It was day - break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed me"
200,7,862,in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light
200,7,863,"gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle"
200,7,864,"round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went"
200,7,865,"about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to"
200,7,866,"each of them man by man: ‘You must not lie sleeping here any longer,’"
200,7,867,"said I to them, ‘we must be going, for Circe has told me all about it.’"
200,7,868,And on this they did as I bade them.
200,7,869,"“Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had"
200,7,870,"with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or"
200,7,871,"courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house - top away from the"
200,7,872,"rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the"
200,7,873,"noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot"
200,7,874,"all about coming down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off"
200,7,875,"the roof and broke his neck, and his soul went down to the house of"
200,7,876,Hades.
200,7,877,"“When I had got the men together I said to them, ‘You think you are"
200,7,878,"about to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead"
200,7,879,"of this, we have got to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to"
200,7,880,consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.’
200,7,881,"“The men were broken - hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves on"
200,7,882,"the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend"
200,7,883,"matters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting"
200,7,884,"our fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard"
200,7,885,"by the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it,"
200,7,886,"for who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not"
200,7,887,wish to be seen?
200,8,1,THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88
200,8,2,"“Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the"
200,8,3,water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on
200,8,4,"board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind."
200,8,5,"Circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew"
200,8,6,dead aft and staid steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well
200,8,7,filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship’s gear and let her
200,8,8,go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were
200,8,9,"full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went down"
200,8,10,"and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of the"
200,8,11,"river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live"
200,8,12,enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce
200,8,13,"neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but"
200,8,14,the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there
200,8,15,"we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the"
200,8,16,waters of Oceanus till we came to the place of which Circe had told us.
200,8,17,"“Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword"
200,8,18,and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink - offering to all the
200,8,19,"dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with"
200,8,20,"water, and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying"
200,8,21,"earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I"
200,8,22,"got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best"
200,8,23,"I had, and would load the pyre with good things. I also particularly"
200,8,24,"promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best"
200,8,25,"in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the"
200,8,26,"throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon"
200,8,27,"the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus — brides,89 young bachelors, old"
200,8,28,"men worn out with toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave"
200,8,29,"men who had been killed in battle, with their armour still smirched"
200,8,30,with blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench
200,8,31,with a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with
200,8,32,fear. When I saw them coming I told the men to be quick and flay the
200,8,33,"carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and"
200,8,34,at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine; but I
200,8,35,sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless
200,8,36,ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my
200,8,37,questions.
200,8,38,"“The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had"
200,8,39,not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and
200,8,40,"unburied in Circe’s house, for we had had too much else to do. I was"
200,8,41,"very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: ‘Elpenor,’ said I, ‘how"
200,8,42,did you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have got here
200,8,43,on foot quicker than I have with my ship.’
200,8,44,"“‘Sir,’ he answered with a groan, ‘it was all bad luck, and my own"
200,8,45,unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe’s
200,8,46,"house, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase"
200,8,47,"but fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul came down to"
200,8,48,the house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have
200,8,49,"left behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father"
200,8,50,"who brought you up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is the"
200,8,51,"one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that when"
200,8,52,you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean
200,8,53,"island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or"
200,8,54,I may bring heaven’s anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I
200,8,55,"have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in"
200,8,56,"days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave"
200,8,57,the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and with my messmates.’
200,8,58,"And I said, ‘My poor fellow, I will do all that you have asked of me.’"
200,8,59,"“Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the"
200,8,60,"one side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost"
200,8,61,of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then came the
200,8,62,"ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her"
200,8,63,"alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears when I saw her,"
200,8,64,"but even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come near the blood"
200,8,65,till I had asked my questions of Teiresias.
200,8,66,"“Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre"
200,8,67,"in his hand. He knew me and said, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why,"
200,8,68,"poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the"
200,8,69,dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw your
200,8,70,sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your questions truly.’
200,8,71,"“So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of"
200,8,72,the blood he began with his prophecy.
200,8,73,"“‘You want to know,’ said he, ‘about your return home, but heaven will"
200,8,74,make this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye of
200,8,75,"Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having"
200,8,76,"blinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home if you"
200,8,77,can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the
200,8,78,"Thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging"
200,8,79,"to the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. If you leave these"
200,8,80,"flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting home, you may yet"
200,8,81,"after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn"
200,8,82,you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men. Even though
200,8,83,"you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing all"
200,8,84,"your men, [in another man’s ship, and you will find trouble in your"
200,8,85,"house, which will be overrun by high - handed people, who are devouring"
200,8,86,your substance under the pretext of paying court and making presents to
200,8,87,your wife.
200,8,88,“‘When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and
200,8,89,"after you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you"
200,8,90,"must take a well made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a"
200,8,91,country where the people have never heard of the sea and do not even
200,8,92,"mix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about ships, and"
200,8,93,oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain
200,8,94,token which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and
200,8,95,will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your
200,8,96,shoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a
200,8,97,"ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune.90 Then go home and offer hecatombs"
200,8,98,"to all the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death"
200,8,99,"shall come to you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very"
200,8,100,"gently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your people"
200,8,101,shall bless you. All that I have said will come true].’91
200,8,102,"“‘This,’ I answered, ‘must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and"
200,8,103,"tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother’s ghost close by us; she"
200,8,104,"is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own"
200,8,105,"son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can"
200,8,106,make her know me.’
200,8,107,"“‘That,’ said he, ‘I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the"
200,8,108,"blood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let"
200,8,109,them have any blood they will go away again.’
200,8,110,"“On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for"
200,8,111,"his prophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until"
200,8,112,my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and
200,8,113,"spoke fondly to me, saying, ‘My son, how did you come down to this"
200,8,114,abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for the
200,8,115,"living to see these places, for between us and them there are great and"
200,8,116,"terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no man can cross on foot,"
200,8,117,but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all this time trying
200,8,118,"to find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to"
200,8,119,Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?’
200,8,120,"“‘Mother,’ said I, ‘I was forced to come here to consult the ghost of"
200,8,121,the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean
200,8,122,"land nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one"
200,8,123,long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with
200,8,124,"Agamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans."
200,8,125,"But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did you have a"
200,8,126,"long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to"
200,8,127,"eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the son whom I left behind"
200,8,128,"me, is my property still in their hands, or has some one else got hold"
200,8,129,"of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me again"
200,8,130,"what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with"
200,8,131,"my son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she"
200,8,132,could and married again?’
200,8,133,"“My mother answered, ‘Your wife still remains in your house, but she is"
200,8,134,in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night
200,8,135,"and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and"
200,8,136,Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain
200,8,137,"largely, as of course he must, considering his position as a"
200,8,138,"magistrate,92 and how every one invites him; your father remains at his"
200,8,139,old place in the country and never goes near the town. He has no
200,8,140,comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in
200,8,141,"front of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in"
200,8,142,"summer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the"
200,8,143,vineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown any how upon the ground. He
200,8,144,"grieves continually about your never having come home, and suffers more"
200,8,145,and more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in this wise:
200,8,146,"heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was"
200,8,147,I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear people out
200,8,148,"and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing and the force"
200,8,149,of my affection for you — this it was that was the death of me.’93
200,8,150,“Then I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother’s ghost.
200,8,151,"Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each"
200,8,152,"time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and"
200,8,153,"being touched to the quick I said to her, ‘Mother, why do you not stay"
200,8,154,still when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms around one
200,8,155,another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in
200,8,156,the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of
200,8,157,grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?’
200,8,158,"“‘My son,’ she answered, ‘most ill - fated of all mankind, it is not"
200,8,159,"Proserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when"
200,8,160,they are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;
200,8,161,these perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has
200,8,162,"left the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now,"
200,8,163,"however, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and note all"
200,8,164,these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.’
200,8,165,"“Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the"
200,8,166,wives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds
200,8,167,"about the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally."
200,8,168,In the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that
200,8,169,"hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at"
200,8,170,"once. So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned"
200,8,171,her told me her race and lineage.
200,8,172,“The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of
200,8,173,Cretheus the son of Aeolus.94 She fell in love with the river Enipeus
200,8,174,who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she
200,8,175,"was taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her"
200,8,176,"lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave"
200,8,177,"arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god,"
200,8,178,whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.
200,8,179,"When the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his"
200,8,180,"own and said, ‘Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods"
200,8,181,"are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time twelve"
200,8,182,"months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go home, but hold"
200,8,183,your tongue and do not tell any one.’
200,8,184,"“Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and"
200,8,185,"Neleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a"
200,8,186,"great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in"
200,8,187,"Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson,"
200,8,188,"Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer."
200,8,189,"“Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of"
200,8,190,"having slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two"
200,8,191,"sons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and"
200,8,192,built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not
200,8,193,hold Thebes till they had walled it.
200,8,194,"“Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove"
200,8,195,"indomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,"
200,8,196,and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.
200,8,197,“I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it
200,8,198,was to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after
200,8,199,"having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to"
200,8,200,"the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the"
200,8,201,spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house of the
200,8,202,"mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging"
200,8,203,spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother — to his ruing bitterly
200,8,204,thereafter.
200,8,205,"“Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given"
200,8,206,priceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of
200,8,207,"Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore"
200,8,208,"Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that marvellously"
200,8,209,"lovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus"
200,8,210,would only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles from
200,8,211,"the grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The only man"
200,8,212,"who would undertake to raid them was a certain excellent seer,95 but"
200,8,213,"the will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle"
200,8,214,caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full year had
200,8,215,"passed and the same season came round again, Iphicles set him at"
200,8,216,"liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, then,"
200,8,217,was the will of Jove accomplished.
200,8,218,"“And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons,"
200,8,219,"Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these"
200,8,220,"heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a"
200,8,221,"special dispensation of Jove, they die and come to life again, each one"
200,8,222,"of them every other day throughout all time, and they have the rank of"
200,8,223,gods.
200,8,224,“After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace of
200,8,225,"Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short"
200,8,226,"lived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,"
200,8,227,"and the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they"
200,8,228,"were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They"
200,8,229,"threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried to set Mount"
200,8,230,"Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa,"
200,8,231,"that they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it too if"
200,8,232,"they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them,"
200,8,233,before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or
200,8,234,chin.
200,8,235,"“Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the"
200,8,236,"magician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens, but"
200,8,237,"he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her in the"
200,8,238,island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.
200,8,239,"“I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own"
200,8,240,husband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name
200,8,241,"every single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and"
200,8,242,"it is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew, or"
200,8,243,"here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.”"
200,8,244,"Here he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless"
200,8,245,throughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them: —
200,8,246,"“What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good"
200,8,247,"looking, and is he not clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you"
200,8,248,"share in the distinction. Do not be in a hurry to send him away, nor"
200,8,249,"niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great need,"
200,8,250,for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.”
200,8,251,Then spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among
200,8,252,"them, “My friends,” said he, “what our august queen has just said to us"
200,8,253,"is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it;"
200,8,254,but the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with King
200,8,255,Alcinous.”
200,8,256,"“The thing shall be done,” exclaimed Alcinous, “as surely as I still"
200,8,257,live and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to
200,8,258,"get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us until to - morrow,"
200,8,259,by which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum that I mean
200,8,260,"to give him. As regards his escort it will be a matter for you all, and"
200,8,261,mine above all others as the chief person among you.”
200,8,262,"And Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay"
200,8,263,"here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded"
200,8,264,"with your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would redound"
200,8,265,"greatly to my advantage, for I should return fuller - handed to my own"
200,8,266,"people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by all who see me"
200,8,267,when I get back to Ithaca.”
200,8,268,"“Ulysses,” replied Alcinous, “not one of us who sees you has any idea"
200,8,269,that you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people
200,8,270,going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see
200,8,271,"through them, but there is a style about your language which assures me"
200,8,272,of your good disposition. Moreover you have told the story of your own
200,8,273,"misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practiced"
200,8,274,"bard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty"
200,8,275,"heroes who went to Troy at the same time with yourself, and perished"
200,8,276,"there. The evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet bed"
200,8,277,"time — go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay here"
200,8,278,"listening till tomorrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell"
200,8,279,us of your adventures.”
200,8,280,"“Alcinous,” answered Ulysses, “there is a time for making speeches, and"
200,8,281,"a time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I will not"
200,8,282,refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades
200,8,283,"who did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but perished on their"
200,8,284,"return, through the treachery of a wicked woman."
200,8,285,"“When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the"
200,8,286,"ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up to me, surrounded by"
200,8,287,those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as
200,8,288,"he had tasted the blood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out"
200,8,289,his arms towards me to embrace me; but he had no strength nor substance
200,8,290,"any more, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him. ‘How did you"
200,8,291,"come by your death,’ said I, ‘King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his"
200,8,292,"winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies"
200,8,293,make an end of you on the main land when you were cattle - lifting or
200,8,294,"sheep - stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of their wives"
200,8,295,and city?’
200,8,296,"“‘Ulysses,’ he answered, ‘noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea"
200,8,297,"in any storm of Neptune’s raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the"
200,8,298,"mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between"
200,8,299,"them. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most"
200,8,300,"miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all"
200,8,301,around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding
200,8,302,"breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You"
200,8,303,"must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement, or"
200,8,304,"in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the"
200,8,305,"way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the"
200,8,306,"loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I"
200,8,307,heard Priam’s daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her
200,8,308,"close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body,"
200,8,309,"and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped"
200,8,310,away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was
200,8,311,"dying, for there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as"
200,8,312,a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy
200,8,313,murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by
200,8,314,"my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought"
200,8,315,disgrace on herself and all women who shall come after — even on the good
200,8,316,ones.’
200,8,317,"“And I said, ‘In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to"
200,8,318,last in the matter of their women’s counsels. See how many of us fell
200,8,319,"for Helen’s sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief"
200,8,320,against you too during your absence.’
200,8,321,"“‘Be sure, therefore,’ continued Agamemnon, ‘and not be too friendly"
200,8,322,even with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly
200,8,323,"well yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about"
200,8,324,"the rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for"
200,8,325,"Penelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We"
200,8,326,left her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for
200,8,327,"Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man’s estate,96"
200,8,328,and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one
200,8,329,"another as it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not"
200,8,330,"even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I"
200,8,331,could do so. Furthermore I say — and lay my saying to your heart — do not
200,8,332,"tell people when you are bringing your ship to Ithaca, but steal a"
200,8,333,"march upon them, for after all this there is no trusting women. But now"
200,8,334,"tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes?"
200,8,335,"Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with Menelaus — for"
200,8,336,I presume that he is still living.’
200,8,337,"“And I said, ‘Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether your"
200,8,338,"son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not"
200,8,339,know.’
200,8,340,“As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the
200,8,341,"ghost of Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax"
200,8,342,who was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son
200,8,343,"of Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously,"
200,8,344,"saying, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will you"
200,8,345,"undertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hades among us"
200,8,346,"silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labour no more?’"
200,8,347,"“And I said, ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the"
200,8,348,"Achaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me"
200,8,349,"about my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get"
200,8,350,"near the Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have been"
200,8,351,"in trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet so"
200,8,352,"fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by"
200,8,353,"all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are here you"
200,8,354,"are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it so much"
200,8,355,to heart even if you are dead.’
200,8,356,"“‘Say not a word,’ he answered, ‘in death’s favour; I would rather be a"
200,8,357,paid servant in a poor man’s house and be above ground than king of
200,8,358,kings among the dead. But give me news about my son; is he gone to the
200,8,359,"wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if"
200,8,360,you have heard anything about my father Peleus — does he still rule among
200,8,361,"the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas and"
200,8,362,Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could I but stand by
200,8,363,"his side, in the light of day, with the same strength that I had when I"
200,8,364,killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy — could I but be as
200,8,365,"I then was and go even for a short time to my father’s house, any one"
200,8,366,who tried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.’
200,8,367,"“‘I have heard nothing,’ I answered, ‘of Peleus, but I can tell you all"
200,8,368,"about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros"
200,8,369,with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always
200,8,370,"first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the"
200,8,371,only two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting on the
200,8,372,"plain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men, but"
200,8,373,"would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many a man"
200,8,374,did he kill in battle — I cannot name every single one of those whom he
200,8,375,"slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how"
200,8,376,"he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who was the"
200,8,377,handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the
200,8,378,"Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman’s bribes. Moreover, when"
200,8,379,all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus had
200,8,380,"made, and it was left to me to settle when we should either open the"
200,8,381,"door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders and"
200,8,382,chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every
200,8,383,"limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he"
200,8,384,was all the time urging me to break out from the horse — grasping the
200,8,385,"handle of his sword and his bronze - shod spear, and breathing fury"
200,8,386,against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his
200,8,387,handsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the
200,8,388,"fortune of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear"
200,8,389,"nor in close combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.’"
200,8,390,"“When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a"
200,8,391,"meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the"
200,8,392,prowess of his son.
200,8,393,“The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own
200,8,394,melancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof — still
200,8,395,angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour
200,8,396,"of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners"
200,8,397,and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never gained the day in
200,8,398,"such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who was foremost of all"
200,8,399,"the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in stature and prowess."
200,8,400,"“When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, ‘Ajax, will you not"
200,8,401,"forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that"
200,8,402,hateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to
200,8,403,lose such a tower of strength as you were to us. We mourned you as much
200,8,404,"as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid"
200,8,405,"on anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danaans, for"
200,8,406,"it was this that made him counsel your destruction — come hither,"
200,8,407,"therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection, and hear what I can"
200,8,408,tell you.’
200,8,409,"“He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other"
200,8,410,"ghosts; nevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his"
200,8,411,"being so angry, or I should have gone on talking to him,97 only that"
200,8,412,there were still others among the dead whom I desired to see.
200,8,413,“Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand
200,8,414,"sitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting"
200,8,415,"and standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his"
200,8,416,sentences upon them.
200,8,417,“After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the
200,8,418,"ghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and he"
200,8,419,"had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever."
200,8,420,“And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering
200,8,421,some nine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were
200,8,422,"digging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them"
200,8,423,"off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove’s mistress"
200,8,424,Leto as she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.
200,8,425,"“I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that"
200,8,426,"reached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never"
200,8,427,"reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it"
200,8,428,"dried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry ground — parched"
200,8,429,"by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees, moreover, that shed"
200,8,430,"their fruit over his head — pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs and"
200,8,431,"juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to"
200,8,432,"take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to the clouds."
200,8,433,“And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone
200,8,434,with both his hands. With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the
200,8,435,"top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over on to"
200,8,436,"the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and the pitiless"
200,8,437,stone98 would come thundering down again on to the plain. Then he would
200,8,438,"begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran off him and"
200,8,439,the steam rose after him.
200,8,440,"“After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he"
200,8,441,"is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to wife,"
200,8,442,who is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him
200,8,443,like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with
200,8,444,"his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string, glaring around"
200,8,445,as though ever on the point of taking aim. About his breast there was a
200,8,446,"wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous fashion with bears,"
200,8,447,"wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there was also war, battle,"
200,8,448,"and death. The man who made that belt, do what he might, would never be"
200,8,449,"able to make another like it. Hercules knew me at once when he saw me,"
200,8,450,"and spoke piteously, saying, ‘My poor Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,"
200,8,451,are you too leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was
200,8,452,"above ground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of"
200,8,453,"suffering, for I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me — a low"
200,8,454,fellow who set me all manner of labours. He once sent me here to fetch
200,8,455,the hell - hound — for he did not think he could find anything harder for
200,8,456,"me than this, but I got the hound out of Hades and brought him to him,"
200,8,457,for Mercury and Minerva helped me.’
200,8,458,"“On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed"
200,8,459,where I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me.
200,8,460,"And I should have seen still other of them that are gone before, whom I"
200,8,461,would fain have seen — Theseus and Pirithous — glorious children of the
200,8,462,"gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered such"
200,8,463,"appalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest Proserpine should send"
200,8,464,up from the house of Hades the head of that awful monster Gorgon. On
200,8,465,this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board at
200,8,466,"once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places,"
200,8,467,whereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We had to
200,8,468,"row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up."
200,9,1,"THE SIRENS, SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS, THE CATTLE OF THE SUN."
200,9,2,"“After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the"
200,9,3,"open sea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is"
200,9,4,dawn and sun - rise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to the
200,9,5,"sands and got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep and"
200,9,6,waited till day should break.
200,9,7,"“Then, when the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent"
200,9,8,some men to Circe’s house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood
200,9,9,"from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we"
200,9,10,had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral rites. When
200,9,11,"his body and armour had been burned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a"
200,9,12,"stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had"
200,9,13,been used to row with.
200,9,14,"“While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back"
200,9,15,"from the house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as she"
200,9,16,"could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and"
200,9,17,"wine. Then she stood in the midst of us and said, ‘You have done a bold"
200,9,18,"thing in going down alive to the house of Hades, and you will have died"
200,9,19,"twice, to other people’s once; now, then, stay here for the rest of the"
200,9,20,"day, feast your fill, and go on with your voyage at daybreak tomorrow"
200,9,21,"morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about your course, and"
200,9,22,will explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering from
200,9,23,misadventure either by land or sea.’
200,9,24,"“We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day"
200,9,25,"to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came on"
200,9,26,"dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the"
200,9,27,ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from
200,9,28,"the others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our"
200,9,29,adventures.
200,9,30,"“‘So far so good,’ said she, when I had ended my story, ‘and now pay"
200,9,31,"attention to what I am about to tell you — heaven itself, indeed, will"
200,9,32,recall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens who
200,9,33,enchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too close
200,9,34,"and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never"
200,9,35,"welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to"
200,9,36,death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead
200,9,37,"men’s bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them."
200,9,38,"Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men’s ears with wax that"
200,9,39,"none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for you"
200,9,40,may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross piece half
200,9,41,"way up the mast,99 and they must lash the rope’s ends to the mast"
200,9,42,"itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and"
200,9,43,"pray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster."
200,9,44,"“‘When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you"
200,9,45,coherent directions100 as to which of two courses you are to take; I
200,9,46,"will lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them"
200,9,47,for yourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against
200,9,48,which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the
200,9,49,blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may
200,9,50,"pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father Jove,"
200,9,51,"but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove has"
200,9,52,to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to
200,9,53,"these rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire"
200,9,54,are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only
200,9,55,"vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the famous Argo on her way"
200,9,56,"from the house of Aetes, and she too would have gone against these"
200,9,57,"great rocks, only that Juno piloted her past them for the love she bore"
200,9,58,to Jason.
200,9,59,“‘Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a
200,9,60,"dark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear not"
200,9,61,even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and
200,9,62,"twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer"
200,9,63,"up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle of it there"
200,9,64,"is a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must"
200,9,65,"take your ship this way, but the cave is so high up that not even the"
200,9,66,stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it Scylla sits and
200,9,67,"yelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young hound, but"
200,9,68,in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one — not even a god — could face
200,9,69,"her without being terror - struck. She has twelve mis - shapen feet, and"
200,9,70,six necks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck
200,9,71,"she has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very"
200,9,72,"close together, so that they would crunch any one to death in a moment,"
200,9,73,and she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and
200,9,74,"peering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any"
200,9,75,"larger monster that she can catch, of the thousands with which"
200,9,76,Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her without losing some
200,9,77,"men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries off a man in"
200,9,78,each mouth.
200,9,79,"“‘You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are so close"
200,9,80,together that there is not more than a bow - shot between them. [A large
200,9,81,"fig tree in full leaf101 grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking"
200,9,82,whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her
200,9,83,"waters, and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not"
200,9,84,"there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not"
200,9,85,save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you
200,9,86,"can, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.’"
200,9,87,"“‘Is there no way,’ said I, ‘of escaping Charybdis, and at the same"
200,9,88,time keeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?’
200,9,89,"“‘You dare devil,’ replied the goddess, ‘you are always wanting to"
200,9,90,fight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even
200,9,91,"by the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage,"
200,9,92,"extreme, rude, cruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your best"
200,9,93,"chance will be to get by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle"
200,9,94,"about her rock while you are putting on your armour, she may catch you"
200,9,95,"with a second cast of her six heads, and snap up another half dozen of"
200,9,96,"your men; so drive your ship past her at full speed, and roar out"
200,9,97,"lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla’s dam, bad luck to her; she will then"
200,9,98,stop her from making a second raid upon you.’
200,9,99,"“‘You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see"
200,9,100,many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun - god — seven
200,9,101,"herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each"
200,9,102,"flock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number, and they"
200,9,103,"are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who are children of"
200,9,104,the sun - god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them
200,9,105,"and had done suckling them sent them to the Thrinacian island, which"
200,9,106,"was a long way off, to live there and look after their father’s flocks"
200,9,107,"and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but"
200,9,108,"getting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you"
200,9,109,"harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and"
200,9,110,"of your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will"
200,9,111,"return late, in bad plight, after losing all your men.’"
200,9,112,"“Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,"
200,9,113,whereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to
200,9,114,"loose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her, took"
200,9,115,"their places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars."
200,9,116,Presently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a fair
200,9,117,"wind that blew dead aft, and staid steadily with us, keeping our sails"
200,9,118,"well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship’s gear, and"
200,9,119,let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.
200,9,120,"“Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, ‘My friends, it"
200,9,121,is not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies
200,9,122,"that Circe has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that"
200,9,123,whether we live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First she said
200,9,124,"we were to keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most beautifully"
200,9,125,in a field of flowers; but she said I might hear them myself so long as
200,9,126,"no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind me to the crosspiece half"
200,9,127,"way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so fast that I"
200,9,128,"cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope’s ends to the mast"
200,9,129,"itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly"
200,9,130,still.’
200,9,131,“I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we reached
200,9,132,"the island of the two Sirens,102 for the wind had been very favourable."
200,9,133,Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of wind
200,9,134,"nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails and stowed"
200,9,135,them; then taking to their oars they whitened the water with the foam
200,9,136,they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it
200,9,137,up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till
200,9,138,"it became soft, which it soon did between the kneading and the rays of"
200,9,139,"the sun - god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all my men, and"
200,9,140,they bound me hands and feet to the mast as I stood upright on the
200,9,141,cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves. When we had got within
200,9,142,"earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a good rate, the Sirens"
200,9,143,saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.
200,9,144,"“‘Come here,’ they sang, ‘renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean name,"
200,9,145,and listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without
200,9,146,staying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song — and he who listens
200,9,147,"will go on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know all the"
200,9,148,"ills that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before Troy, and"
200,9,149,can tell you everything that is going to happen over the whole world.’
200,9,150,"“They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them"
200,9,151,further I made signs by frowning to my men that they should set me
200,9,152,"free; but they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes"
200,9,153,bound me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of
200,9,154,the Sirens’ voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and
200,9,155,unbound me.
200,9,156,“Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from
200,9,157,"which spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were"
200,9,158,"so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea"
200,9,159,"resounded with the rushing of the waters,103 but the ship stayed where"
200,9,160,"it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore, and"
200,9,161,exhorted them man by man not to lose heart.
200,9,162,"“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘this is not the first time that we have been in"
200,9,163,"danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops"
200,9,164,"shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel saved"
200,9,165,"us then, and we shall live to look back on all this as well. Now,"
200,9,166,"therefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row on with might"
200,9,167,"and main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend to them,"
200,9,168,for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these steaming
200,9,169,"rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and be over"
200,9,170,"yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.’"
200,9,171,“So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster
200,9,172,"Scylla, for I knew the men would not go on rowing if I did, but would"
200,9,173,huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe’s
200,9,174,strict instructions — I put on my armour. Then seizing two strong spears
200,9,175,"I took my stand on the ship’s bows, for it was there that I expected"
200,9,176,"first to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my men so much"
200,9,177,"harm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though I strained my eyes"
200,9,178,with looking the gloomy rock all over and over.
200,9,179,"“Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand"
200,9,180,"was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt"
200,9,181,"water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when"
200,9,182,"it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the top of"
200,9,183,"the rocks on either side. When she began to suck again, we could see"
200,9,184,"the water all inside whirling round and round, and it made a deafening"
200,9,185,sound as it broke against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the
200,9,186,"whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were at their wits"
200,9,187,"ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and were expecting"
200,9,188,"each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and"
200,9,189,snatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and
200,9,190,"men, and in a moment I saw their hands and feet ever so high above me,"
200,9,191,"struggling in the air as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them"
200,9,192,"call out my name in one last despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated,"
200,9,193,"spear in hand, upon some jutting rock104 throws bait into the water to"
200,9,194,"deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the ox’s horn with"
200,9,195,"which his spear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as he"
200,9,196,catches them one by one — even so did Scylla land these panting creatures
200,9,197,"on her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they"
200,9,198,screamed and stretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony.
200,9,199,This was the most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.
200,9,200,"“When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible"
200,9,201,"Charybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun - god, where were the"
200,9,202,goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at
200,9,203,sea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing as they came home to the
200,9,204,"yards, and the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the blind Theban"
200,9,205,"prophet Teiresias had told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe had"
200,9,206,warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun - god. So being much
200,9,207,"troubled I said to the men, ‘My men, I know you are hard pressed, but"
200,9,208,"listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how"
200,9,209,carefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed
200,9,210,"sun - god, for it was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie."
200,9,211,"Head the ship, therefore, away from the island.’"
200,9,212,"“The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an"
200,9,213,"insolent answer. ‘Ulysses,’ said he, ‘you are cruel; you are very"
200,9,214,"strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,"
200,9,215,"and now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you"
200,9,216,will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this
200,9,217,"island, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on"
200,9,218,through the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the winds
200,9,219,blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one of
200,9,220,"those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which so often"
200,9,221,"wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now,"
200,9,222,"therefore, let us obey the behests of night and prepare our supper here"
200,9,223,hard by the ship; to - morrow morning we will go on board again and put
200,9,224,out to sea.’
200,9,225,"“Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that"
200,9,226,"heaven meant us a mischief and said, ‘You force me to yield, for you"
200,9,227,"are many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his"
200,9,228,solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of
200,9,229,"sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either, but"
200,9,230,will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.’
200,9,231,"“They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath"
200,9,232,we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh
200,9,233,"water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as"
200,9,234,"they had had enough to eat and drink, they began talking about their"
200,9,235,poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them
200,9,236,weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound sleep.
200,9,237,“In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their
200,9,238,"places, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that"
200,9,239,"land and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out"
200,9,240,"of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn,"
200,9,241,"appeared, we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein"
200,9,242,"the sea - nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the men"
200,9,243,together in council.
200,9,244,"“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘we have meat and drink in the ship, let us"
200,9,245,"mind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it;"
200,9,246,"for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives"
200,9,247,ear to everything.’ And again they promised that they would obey.
200,9,248,"“For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was"
200,9,249,"no other wind, but only South and East.105 As long as corn and wine"
200,9,250,"held out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,"
200,9,251,"however, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to"
200,9,252,"go further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking"
200,9,253,whatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One
200,9,254,"day, therefore, I went up inland that I might pray heaven to show me"
200,9,255,some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough to be clear of
200,9,256,"all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from the"
200,9,257,"wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus till by"
200,9,258,and by they sent me off into a sweet sleep.
200,9,259,"“Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men, ‘Listen"
200,9,260,"to me,’ said he, ‘my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there"
200,9,261,is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these
200,9,262,cows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal gods? If we ever get
200,9,263,"back to Ithaca, we can build a fine temple to the sun - god and enrich it"
200,9,264,"with every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined to sink our"
200,9,265,"ship out of revenge for these homed cattle, and the other gods are of"
200,9,266,"the same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and"
200,9,267,"have done with it, than be starved to death by inches in such a desert"
200,9,268,island as this is.’
200,9,269,"“Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle,"
200,9,270,"so fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men,"
200,9,271,"therefore, drove in the best of them, and they all stood round them"
200,9,272,"saying their prayers, and using young oak - shoots instead of"
200,9,273,"barley - meal, for there was no barley left. When they had done praying"
200,9,274,they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the
200,9,275,"thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some"
200,9,276,pieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to make
200,9,277,"drink - offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept"
200,9,278,pouring on a little water from time to time while the inward meats were
200,9,279,"being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned and they had"
200,9,280,"tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces"
200,9,281,upon the spits.
200,9,282,"“By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the ship"
200,9,283,"and to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast meat,"
200,9,284,"so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. ‘Father Jove,’ I"
200,9,285,"exclaimed, ‘and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, you"
200,9,286,have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have sent me;
200,9,287,see what fine work these men of mine have been making in my absence.’
200,9,288,“Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had
200,9,289,"been killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said to"
200,9,290,"the immortals, ‘Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in"
200,9,291,"everlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses’ ship:"
200,9,292,"they have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing I"
200,9,293,"loved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. If"
200,9,294,"they do not square accounts with me about my cows, I will go down to"
200,9,295,Hades and shine there among the dead.’
200,9,296,"“‘Sun,’ said Jove, ‘go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over"
200,9,297,the fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with a
200,9,298,bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.’
200,9,299,"“I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from the"
200,9,300,mouth of Mercury.
200,9,301,“As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked each
200,9,302,"one of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for the"
200,9,303,cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to show signs
200,9,304,"and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about, and"
200,9,305,"the joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the meat, whether"
200,9,306,"cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do."
200,9,307,“For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon
200,9,308,"them, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the fury"
200,9,309,"of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts,"
200,9,310,"spread sail, and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from the"
200,9,311,"island, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturn raised"
200,9,312,"a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. We did"
200,9,313,"not get on much further, for in another moment we were caught by a"
200,9,314,terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so
200,9,315,"that it fell aft, while all the ship’s gear tumbled about at the bottom"
200,9,316,of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the
200,9,317,"ship’s stern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and"
200,9,318,"he fell overboard as though he were diving, with no more life left in"
200,9,319,him.
200,9,320,"“Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round and"
200,9,321,"round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck"
200,9,322,it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in the water
200,9,323,"round the ship, looking like so many sea - gulls, but the god presently"
200,9,324,deprived them of all chance of getting home again.
200,9,325,“I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel
200,9,326,(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the
200,9,327,direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox - thong still
200,9,328,"hanging about it, and with this I lashed the mast and keel together,"
200,9,329,and getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to
200,9,330,take me.
200,9,331,"“[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got into"
200,9,332,"the South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back to the"
200,9,333,terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually
200,9,334,"happened, for I was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise"
200,9,335,"had reached the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking"
200,9,336,"down the salt sea water,106 but I was carried aloft toward the fig"
200,9,337,"tree, which I caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not"
200,9,338,"plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a"
200,9,339,long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too
200,9,340,"high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung"
200,9,341,"patiently on, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft"
200,9,342,again — and a very long while it seemed. A jury - man is not more glad to
200,9,343,"get home to supper, after having been long detained in court by"
200,9,344,"troublesome cases, than I was to see my raft beginning to work its way"
200,9,345,"out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go with my hands and feet,"
200,9,346,"and fell heavily into the sea, hard by my raft on to which I then got,"
200,9,347,"and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the father of gods and"
200,9,348,men would not let her get further sight of me — otherwise I should have
200,9,349,certainly been lost.107
200,9,350,“Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the
200,9,351,"gods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and"
200,9,352,"powerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I need"
200,9,353,"say no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all about it"
200,9,354,"yesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and over again.”"
200,10,1,ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.
200,10,2,"Thus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered"
200,10,3,"cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous"
200,10,4,began to speak.
200,10,5,"“Ulysses,” said he, “now that you have reached my house I doubt not you"
200,10,6,will get home without further misadventure no matter how much you have
200,10,7,"suffered in the past. To you others, however, who come here night after"
200,10,8,"night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard, I would insist"
200,10,9,"as follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought"
200,10,10,"gold,108 and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;"
200,10,11,"let us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a"
200,10,12,large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a
200,10,13,general rate; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear the
200,10,14,burden of such a handsome present.”
200,10,15,"Every one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in his"
200,10,16,"own abode. When the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared they"
200,10,17,hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.
200,10,18,Alcinous went on board and saw everything so securely stowed under the
200,10,19,ship’s benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers.
200,10,20,"Then they went to the house of Alcinous to get dinner, and he"
200,10,21,sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove who is the lord of all.
200,10,22,"They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner, after which"
200,10,23,"the inspired bard, Demodocus, who was a favourite with every one, sang"
200,10,24,"to them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as"
200,10,25,"though to hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on his way. As"
200,10,26,one who has been all day ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen
200,10,27,keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when night comes that he
200,10,28,"may go and get it, for it is all his legs can do to carry him, even so"
200,10,29,"did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down, and he at once said to the"
200,10,30,"Phaeacians, addressing himself more particularly to King Alcinous:"
200,10,31,"“Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink - offerings and send me"
200,10,32,"on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart’s desire by giving"
200,10,33,"me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may"
200,10,34,turn to good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace
200,10,35,"among friends,109 and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction"
200,10,36,to your wives and children;110 may heaven vouchsafe you every good
200,10,37,"grace, and may no evil thing come among your people.”"
200,10,38,Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and
200,10,39,agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken
200,10,40,"reasonably. Alcinous therefore said to his servant, “Pontonous, mix"
200,10,41,"some wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to"
200,10,42,"father Jove, and speed our guest upon his way.”"
200,10,43,Pontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others
200,10,44,each from his own seat made a drink - offering to the blessed gods that
200,10,45,"live in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands"
200,10,46,of queen Arete.
200,10,47,"“Farewell, queen,” said he, “henceforward and for ever, till age and"
200,10,48,"death, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take"
200,10,49,"my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people, and"
200,10,50,with king Alcinous.”
200,10,51,"As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to"
200,10,52,conduct him to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some
200,10,53,"maidservants with him — one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to"
200,10,54,"carry his strong box, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to"
200,10,55,"the water side the crew took these things and put them on board, with"
200,10,56,all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen
200,10,57,sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship.
200,10,58,"Then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew"
200,10,59,took every man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone
200,10,60,"to which it had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing out to sea,"
200,10,61,"Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber.111"
200,10,62,The ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies
200,10,63,over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curvetted as it
200,10,64,"were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water"
200,10,65,"seethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a"
200,10,66,"falcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus,"
200,10,67,"then, she cut her way through the water, carrying one who was as"
200,10,68,"cunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of"
200,10,69,all that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves
200,10,70,of the weary sea.
200,10,71,"When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show,"
200,10,72,the ship drew near to land.112 Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the
200,10,73,"old merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the line"
200,10,74,of the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of
200,10,75,"wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a ship"
200,10,76,may lie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour there is
200,10,77,"a large olive tree, and at no great distance a fine overarching cavern"
200,10,78,sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads.113 There are mixing bowls
200,10,79,"within it and wine - jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover,"
200,10,80,there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of
200,10,81,sea purple — very curious to see — and at all times there is water within
200,10,82,"it. It has two entrances, one facing North by which mortals can go down"
200,10,83,"into the cave, while the other comes from the South and is more"
200,10,84,"mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the way taken"
200,10,85,by the gods.
200,10,86,"Into this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the"
200,10,87,place.114 She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length
200,10,88,"on to the shore;115 when, however, they had landed, the first thing"
200,10,89,they did was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the
200,10,90,"ship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took"
200,10,91,out the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him
200,10,92,when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all
200,10,93,"together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear"
200,10,94,some passer by116 might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and
200,10,95,then they made the best of their way home again.
200,10,96,But Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already
200,10,97,"threatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with Jove. “Father Jove,” said"
200,10,98,"he, “I shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods,"
200,10,99,"if mortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show"
200,10,100,such small regard for me. I said I would let Ulysses get home when he
200,10,101,had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never get home
200,10,102,"at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head about it, and"
200,10,103,promised that he should do so; but now they have brought him in a ship
200,10,104,fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him with more
200,10,105,"magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he would ever"
200,10,106,"have brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of the spoil and"
200,10,107,got home without misadventure.”
200,10,108,"And Jove answered, “What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking"
200,10,109,about? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would be
200,10,110,monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are. As
200,10,111,"regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence and"
200,10,112,"treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself to deal"
200,10,113,"with him as you may think proper, so do just as you please.”"
200,10,114,"“I should have done so at once,” replied Neptune, “if I were not"
200,10,115,"anxious to avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I"
200,10,116,should like to wreck the Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its
200,10,117,escort. This will stop them from escorting people in future; and I
200,10,118,should also like to bury their city under a huge mountain.”
200,10,119,"“My good friend,” answered Jove, “I should recommend you at the very"
200,10,120,"moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,"
200,10,121,to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will
200,10,122,"astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under the"
200,10,123,mountain.”
200,10,124,When earth - encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the
200,10,125,"Phaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid"
200,10,126,"way, had got close in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and"
200,10,127,drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground.
200,10,128,After this he went away.
200,10,129,"The Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn"
200,10,130,"towards his neighbour, saying, “Bless my heart, who is it that can have"
200,10,131,rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port? We could
200,10,132,see the whole of her only a moment ago.”
200,10,133,"This was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous"
200,10,134,"said, “I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that"
200,10,135,Neptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over the
200,10,136,"sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from"
200,10,137,"an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain. This was what my"
200,10,138,"old father used to say, and now it is all coming true.117 Now therefore"
200,10,139,let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off giving
200,10,140,"people escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice"
200,10,141,"twelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not"
200,10,142,bury our city under the high mountain.” When the people heard this they
200,10,143,were afraid and got ready the bulls.
200,10,144,"Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray to king Neptune,"
200,10,145,standing round his altar; and at the same time118 Ulysses woke up once
200,10,146,more upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know
200,10,147,"it again; moreover, Jove’s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so"
200,10,148,"that people might not know of his having come, and that she might tell"
200,10,149,him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and
200,10,150,friends recognising him119 until he had taken his revenge upon the
200,10,151,"wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to"
200,10,152,"him — the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the"
200,10,153,"goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his"
200,10,154,native land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and
200,10,155,cried aloud despairingly.
200,10,156,"“Alas,” he exclaimed, “among what manner of people am I fallen? Are"
200,10,157,they savage and uncivilised or hospitable and humane? Where shall I put
200,10,158,"all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had staid over"
200,10,159,there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other great
200,10,160,chief who would have been good to me and given me an escort. As it is I
200,10,161,"do not know where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave it here for"
200,10,162,fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good truth the chiefs and
200,10,163,"rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by me, and have"
200,10,164,left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to
200,10,165,Ithaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants
200,10,166,"chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do"
200,10,167,"wrong. Still, I suppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have"
200,10,168,gone off with any of them.”
200,10,169,"He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his"
200,10,170,"clothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about"
200,10,171,"not being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of"
200,10,172,the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him
200,10,173,"disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a"
200,10,174,good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her
200,10,175,comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad when he
200,10,176,"saw her, and went straight up to her."
200,10,177,"“My friend,” said he, “you are the first person whom I have met with in"
200,10,178,"this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed"
200,10,179,"towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your"
200,10,180,"knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell"
200,10,181,"me truly, what land and country is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I"
200,10,182,"on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?”"
200,10,183,"Minerva answered, “Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come"
200,10,184,"from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It is"
200,10,185,"a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is"
200,10,186,"rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no means a bad"
200,10,187,island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn and also
200,10,188,"wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also and"
200,10,189,"goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places"
200,10,190,"where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known"
200,10,191,"even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a long way off from this"
200,10,192,Achaean country.”
200,10,193,"Ulysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own"
200,10,194,"country, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and"
200,10,195,made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.
200,10,196,"“I heard of Ithaca,” said he, “when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and"
200,10,197,now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as
200,10,198,"much more behind me for my children, but am flying because I killed"
200,10,199,"Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him"
200,10,200,because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so
200,10,201,much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of
200,10,202,the weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally at Troy as
200,10,203,"vassal, but had set myself up as an independent ruler, so I lay in wait"
200,10,204,"for him with one of my followers by the road side, and speared him as"
200,10,205,he was coming into town from the country. It was a very dark night and
200,10,206,"nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but"
200,10,207,"as soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who"
200,10,208,"were Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis"
200,10,209,"where the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them."
200,10,210,"They meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we"
200,10,211,sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to get
200,10,212,"inside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though we"
200,10,213,"wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were."
200,10,214,"I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goods out of"
200,10,215,"the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the sand."
200,10,216,"Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress"
200,10,217,of mind.”
200,10,218,"Such was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand."
200,10,219,"Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, “He must be"
200,10,220,"indeed a shifty lying fellow,” said she, “who could surpass you in all"
200,10,221,manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist. Dare
200,10,222,"devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can you not"
200,10,223,"drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are"
200,10,224,"in your own country again? We will say no more, however, about this,"
200,10,225,for we can both of us deceive upon occasion — you are the most
200,10,226,"accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for"
200,10,227,diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not know
200,10,228,"Jove’s daughter Minerva — me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch"
200,10,229,"over you in all your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians take so"
200,10,230,"great a liking to you? And now, again, I am come here to talk things"
200,10,231,"over with you, and help you to hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians"
200,10,232,give you; I want to tell you about the troubles that await you in your
200,10,233,"own house; you have got to face them, but tell no one, neither man nor"
200,10,234,"woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything, and put up with"
200,10,235,"every man’s insolence, without a word.”"
200,10,236,"And Ulysses answered, “A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you"
200,10,237,are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is
200,10,238,"a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This much,"
200,10,239,"however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as"
200,10,240,"we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on which we"
200,10,241,"went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven"
200,10,242,"dispersed us — from that day, Minerva, I saw no more of you, and cannot"
200,10,243,ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty; I had
200,10,244,to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I
200,10,245,"reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took me"
200,10,246,"into the town.120 And now, I beseech you in your father’s name, tell me"
200,10,247,"the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in Ithaca. I am in"
200,10,248,some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you
200,10,249,"have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own"
200,10,250,country?”
200,10,251,"“You are always taking something of that sort in your head,” replied"
200,10,252,"Minerva, “and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you"
200,10,253,"are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning"
200,10,254,from so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife and
200,10,255,"children, but you do not seem to care about asking after them or"
200,10,256,"hearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife, who"
200,10,257,"remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no peace night or"
200,10,258,day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near
200,10,259,"you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back"
200,10,260,"safely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to"
200,10,261,"quarrel with my uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having blinded"
200,10,262,"his son.121 I will now, however, point out to you the lie of the land,"
200,10,263,and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the old
200,10,264,"merman Phorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of"
200,10,265,it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;122 here too is the
200,10,266,overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable
200,10,267,"hecatomb to the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.”"
200,10,268,As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then
200,10,269,"Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed"
200,10,270,"the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs,"
200,10,271,"saying, “Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never"
200,10,272,"again to see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving"
200,10,273,"salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if"
200,10,274,"Jove’s redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to"
200,10,275,manhood.”
200,10,276,"“Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,” rejoined Minerva,"
200,10,277,"“let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where"
200,10,278,they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.”
200,10,279,Therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding
200,10,280,"places, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and"
200,10,281,good clothing which the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed
200,10,282,"everything carefully away, and Minerva set a stone against the door of"
200,10,283,"the cave. Then the two sat down by the root of the great olive, and"
200,10,284,consulted how to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors.
200,10,285,"“Ulysses,” said Minerva, “noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay"
200,10,286,hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in your
200,10,287,"house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding presents"
200,10,288,"to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving hope and"
200,10,289,"sending encouraging messages123 to every one of them, but meaning the"
200,10,290,very opposite of all she says.”
200,10,291,"And Ulysses answered, “In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have"
200,10,292,"come to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you"
200,10,293,had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall best
200,10,294,avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my heart as
200,10,295,on the day when we loosed Troy’s fair diadem from her brow. Help me now
200,10,296,"as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if you, goddess,"
200,10,297,will be with me.”
200,10,298,"“Trust me for that,” said she, “I will not lose sight of you when once"
200,10,299,"we set about it, and I imagine that some of those who are devouring"
200,10,300,your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and
200,10,301,brains. I will begin by disguising you so that no human being shall
200,10,302,know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your
200,10,303,yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see
200,10,304,"it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for you, and make you an"
200,10,305,"unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the"
200,10,306,son whom you left behind you. Then go at once to the swineherd who is
200,10,307,"in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected towards you,"
200,10,308,and is devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding his
200,10,309,"pigs near the rock that is called Raven124 by the fountain Arethusa,"
200,10,310,where they are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their
200,10,311,"manner. Stay with him and find out how things are going, while I"
200,10,312,"proceed to Sparta and see your son, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon,"
200,10,313,where he has gone to try and find out whether you are still alive.”125
200,10,314,"“But why,” said Ulysses, “did you not tell him, for you knew all about"
200,10,315,it? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship
200,10,316,while others are eating up his estate?”
200,10,317,"Minerva answered, “Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be"
200,10,318,"well spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but is"
200,10,319,"staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with"
200,10,320,abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying
200,10,321,"in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I do"
200,10,322,"not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who are"
200,10,323,now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves.”
200,10,324,As she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with
200,10,325,"wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over"
200,10,326,"his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine"
200,10,327,"ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him,"
200,10,328,"and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also gave"
200,10,329,"him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with"
200,10,330,"a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to"
200,10,331,sling it over his shoulder.
200,10,332,"When the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess"
200,10,333,went straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.
200,11,1,ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.
200,11,2,"Ulysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the"
200,11,3,wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the
200,11,4,"place where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was"
200,11,5,the most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his
200,11,6,"hut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be"
200,11,7,"seen from far. He had made them spacious126 and fair to see, with a"
200,11,8,free run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his
200,11,9,"master’s absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,"
200,11,10,"without saying anything to Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them"
200,11,11,on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of
200,11,12,"oaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside he had"
200,11,13,built twelve styes near one another for the sows to lie in. There were
200,11,14,"fifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding sows; but the"
200,11,15,"boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors kept"
200,11,16,"on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he had"
200,11,17,"continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the"
200,11,18,"herdsman’s four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always"
200,11,19,with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of
200,11,20,sandals127 from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding
200,11,21,"the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth to town"
200,11,22,with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they might
200,11,23,sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.
200,11,24,When the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at
200,11,25,"him, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of"
200,11,26,"the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by"
200,11,27,"them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide,"
200,11,28,rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off
200,11,29,"by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Ulysses, “Old"
200,11,30,"man, the dogs were likely to have made short work of you, and then you"
200,11,31,would have got me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough
200,11,32,"worries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in"
200,11,33,continual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people
200,11,34,"to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving"
200,11,35,"in some distant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill"
200,11,36,"of bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your"
200,11,37,misfortunes.”
200,11,38,On this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down.
200,11,39,"He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of"
200,11,40,this he threw the shaggy chamois skin — a great thick one — on which he
200,11,41,"used to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome,"
200,11,42,"and said “May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your"
200,11,43,heart’s desire in return for the kind way in which you have received
200,11,44,me.”
200,11,45,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Stranger, though a still"
200,11,46,"poorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult"
200,11,47,"him, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what"
200,11,48,"you can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have"
200,11,49,"young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for"
200,11,50,heaven has hindered the return of him who would have been always good
200,11,51,"to me and given me something of my own — a house, a piece of land, a good"
200,11,52,"looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who"
200,11,53,"has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as"
200,11,54,they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown
200,11,55,"old here he would have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I"
200,11,56,"wish that Helen’s whole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been"
200,11,57,the death of many a good man. It was this matter that took my master to
200,11,58,"Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans in the cause of"
200,11,59,king Agamemnon.”
200,11,60,As he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where
200,11,61,the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought
200,11,62,"back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted"
200,11,63,them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before
200,11,64,"Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over"
200,11,65,with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of
200,11,66,"ivy - wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin."
200,11,67,"“Fall to, stranger,” said he, “on a dish of servant’s pork. The fat"
200,11,68,"pigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or"
200,11,69,"scruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and"
200,11,70,respect those who do what is lawful and right. Even the fierce
200,11,71,"freebooters who go raiding on other people’s land, and Jove gives them"
200,11,72,"their spoil — even they, when they have filled their ships and got home"
200,11,73,"again live conscience - stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but"
200,11,74,some god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone;
200,11,75,"they will not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their"
200,11,76,"offers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force,"
200,11,77,"without fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they"
200,11,78,"sacrifice not one victim nor two only, and they take the run of his"
200,11,79,"wine, for he was exceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca"
200,11,80,or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men
200,11,81,put together. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of
200,11,82,"cattle upon the main land, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also"
200,11,83,"twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers feed him"
200,11,84,twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even
200,11,85,"large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in the"
200,11,86,charge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the
200,11,87,"best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the"
200,11,88,"pigs that you see here, and I have to keep picking out the best I have"
200,11,89,and sending it to them.”
200,11,90,"This was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously"
200,11,91,"without a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was"
200,11,92,"satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,"
200,11,93,"filled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said"
200,11,94,"as he took it in his hands, “My friend, who was this master of yours"
200,11,95,"that bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell"
200,11,96,me? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he
200,11,97,"was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods"
200,11,98,"know, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have travelled"
200,11,99,much.”
200,11,100,"Eumaeus answered, “Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will"
200,11,101,"get Ulysses’ wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in"
200,11,102,"want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a"
200,11,103,word of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my
200,11,104,"mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes"
200,11,105,"much of them, and asks them all manner of questions, crying all the"
200,11,106,"time as women will when they have lost their husbands. And you too, old"
200,11,107,"man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty"
200,11,108,story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to
200,11,109,"pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones are"
200,11,110,"lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone,"
200,11,111,and a bad business it is for all his friends — for me especially; go
200,11,112,"where I may I shall never find so good a master, not even if I were to"
200,11,113,go home to my mother and father where I was bred and born. I do not so
200,11,114,"much care, however, about my parents now, though I should dearly like"
200,11,115,to see them again in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that
200,11,116,grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is
200,11,117,"here no longer, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me"
200,11,118,that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory.”
200,11,119,"“My friend,” replied Ulysses, “you are very positive, and very hard of"
200,11,120,"belief about your master’s coming home again, nevertheless I will not"
200,11,121,"merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything"
200,11,122,"for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and"
200,11,123,"cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take"
200,11,124,"anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire,"
200,11,125,"who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear by king Jove, by the"
200,11,126,"rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now"
200,11,127,"come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses will"
200,11,128,return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the
200,11,129,beginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who
200,11,130,are ill treating his wife and son.”
200,11,131,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Old man, you will neither"
200,11,132,"get paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink"
200,11,133,"your wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep"
200,11,134,on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks
200,11,135,"about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I"
200,11,136,"only wish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his"
200,11,137,son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his;
200,11,138,"he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse man,"
200,11,139,"face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has"
200,11,140,"been unsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get"
200,11,141,"news of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is"
200,11,142,"coming home, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a"
200,11,143,"name in Ithaca. But let us say no more about him, and leave him to be"
200,11,144,"taken, or else to escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him"
200,11,145,"to protect him. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also,"
200,11,146,"for I want to know, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of"
200,11,147,"your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew"
200,11,148,"brought you to Ithaca, and from what country they professed to come — for"
200,11,149,you cannot have come by land.”
200,11,150,"And Ulysses answered, “I will tell you all about it. If there were meat"
200,11,151,"and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do"
200,11,152,"but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could easily"
200,11,153,talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of
200,11,154,the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.
200,11,155,"“I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man, who had many"
200,11,156,"sons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had"
200,11,157,"purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax"
200,11,158,"(whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour among"
200,11,159,"the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons) put"
200,11,160,me on the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock.
200,11,161,"When, however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided"
200,11,162,"his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a"
200,11,163,"holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry"
200,11,164,"into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the"
200,11,165,"field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw"
200,11,166,"you can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to"
200,11,167,spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my
200,11,168,men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much
200,11,169,"as a thought, but was the first to leap forward and spear all whom I"
200,11,170,"could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care about farm"
200,11,171,"work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring up children. My"
200,11,172,"delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows — things that most"
200,11,173,men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another
200,11,174,"another, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the"
200,11,175,"Achaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on"
200,11,176,"foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil"
200,11,177,"in the first instance, and much more was allotted to me later on."
200,11,178,"“My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but"
200,11,179,"when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many"
200,11,180,"perished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to"
200,11,181,"Troy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing"
200,11,182,"so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked"
200,11,183,the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it
200,11,184,was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily
200,11,185,"with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of"
200,11,186,"making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it."
200,11,187,"I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I"
200,11,188,"and my men made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice"
200,11,189,"to the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board"
200,11,190,and set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were
200,11,191,"going down a river. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had"
200,11,192,"no sickness on board, but sat where we were and let the ships go as the"
200,11,193,wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river
200,11,194,"Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay"
200,11,195,by them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre
200,11,196,from every point of vantage.
200,11,197,"“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and"
200,11,198,"ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their"
200,11,199,"wives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and"
200,11,200,"when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the"
200,11,201,plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of
200,11,202,"armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer"
200,11,203,"face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians"
200,11,204,"killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for"
200,11,205,"them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus — and I wish I had died"
200,11,206,"then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for"
200,11,207,me — I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand;
200,11,208,"then I went straight up to the king’s chariot, clasped his knees and"
200,11,209,"kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot,"
200,11,210,and took me weeping to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen
200,11,211,"spears and tried to kill me in their fury, but the king protected me,"
200,11,212,"for he feared the wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who"
200,11,213,punishes those who do evil.
200,11,214,“I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the
200,11,215,"Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on"
200,11,216,"for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who"
200,11,217,"had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me"
200,11,218,"over into going with him to Phoenicia, where his house and his"
200,11,219,"possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the"
200,11,220,end of that time when months and days had gone by till the same season
200,11,221,"had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a"
200,11,222,"pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that place, but"
200,11,223,really that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I
200,11,224,"suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not"
200,11,225,help it.
200,11,226,“The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea
200,11,227,"that lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled"
200,11,228,"their destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could"
200,11,229,"see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and"
200,11,230,the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts
200,11,231,and the ship went round and round and was filled with fire and
200,11,232,brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all into the sea;
200,11,233,they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like so
200,11,234,"many sea - gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of"
200,11,235,"getting home again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship’s"
200,11,236,"mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and"
200,11,237,drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the
200,11,238,darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian
200,11,239,coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably
200,11,240,without charging me anything at all — for his son found me when I was
200,11,241,"nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand,"
200,11,242,took me to his father’s house and gave me clothes to wear.
200,11,243,"“There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had"
200,11,244,"entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his"
200,11,245,"homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought"
200,11,246,iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep his family
200,11,247,"for ten generations, so much had he left in the house of king Pheidon."
200,11,248,But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove’s
200,11,249,"mind from the god’s high oak tree, and know whether after so long an"
200,11,250,"absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the"
200,11,251,"king swore in my presence, making drink - offerings in his own house as"
200,11,252,"he did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found,"
200,11,253,that should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before
200,11,254,"Ulysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing"
200,11,255,"for the wheat - growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge"
200,11,256,of her to be sure and take me safely to King Acastus.
200,11,257,“These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the
200,11,258,"very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from"
200,11,259,land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the
200,11,260,"shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered"
200,11,261,"old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they"
200,11,262,"reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a"
200,11,263,"strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper by"
200,11,264,"the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn"
200,11,265,"my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I"
200,11,266,"struck out and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near"
200,11,267,a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my
200,11,268,"having escaped and went searching about for me, till at last they"
200,11,269,"thought it was no further use and went back to their ship. The gods,"
200,11,270,"having hidden me thus easily, then took me to a good man’s door — for it"
200,11,271,seems that I am not to die yet awhile.”
200,11,272,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Poor unhappy stranger, I"
200,11,273,"have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but"
200,11,274,that part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to
200,11,275,believe it. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this
200,11,276,way? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and all of
200,11,277,"them detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him"
200,11,278,die with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done;
200,11,279,for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his
200,11,280,"son would have been heir to his renown, but now the storm winds have"
200,11,281,spirited him away we know not whither.
200,11,282,"“As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to"
200,11,283,the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news
200,11,284,"about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those"
200,11,285,"who grieve over the king’s absence, and those who rejoice at it because"
200,11,286,they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I
200,11,287,have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was
200,11,288,"taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long way till"
200,11,289,"at last he reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he"
200,11,290,"had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships"
200,11,291,which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the
200,11,292,"following summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back"
200,11,293,"much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has"
200,11,294,"brought you to my door, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain"
200,11,295,"hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but"
200,11,296,"only out of respect for Jove the god of hospitality, as fearing him and"
200,11,297,pitying you.”
200,11,298,"Ulysses answered, “I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have"
200,11,299,"given you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a"
200,11,300,"bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master"
200,11,301,"comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to"
200,11,302,"Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he will,"
200,11,303,"set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder precipice,"
200,11,304,as a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling lies.”
200,11,305,"“And a pretty figure I should cut then,” replied Eumaeus, “both now and"
200,11,306,"hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and"
200,11,307,showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good
200,11,308,earnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will
200,11,309,"come in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.”"
200,11,310,"Thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the"
200,11,311,"pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a"
200,11,312,tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But
200,11,313,"Eumaeus called to his men and said, “Bring in the best pig you have,"
200,11,314,"that I may sacrifice him for this stranger, and we will take toll of"
200,11,315,"him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs,"
200,11,316,while others reap the fruit of our labour.”
200,11,317,"On this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine"
200,11,318,"fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not"
200,11,319,"forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the first"
200,11,320,thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig’s face and throw them
200,11,321,"into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses might"
200,11,322,return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which
200,11,323,"he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it,"
200,11,324,"while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and"
200,11,325,Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the
200,11,326,"fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers;"
200,11,327,"they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits"
200,11,328,and roasted them till they were done; when they had taken them off the
200,11,329,"spits they threw them on to the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who"
200,11,330,"was a most equitable man, then stood up to give every one his share. He"
200,11,331,made seven portions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of
200,11,332,"Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt"
200,11,333,out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways
200,11,334,"down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much"
200,11,335,"pleased. “I hope, Eumaeus,” said he, “that Jove will be as well"
200,11,336,"disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you are showing to an"
200,11,337,outcast like myself.”
200,11,338,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Eat, my good fellow, and"
200,11,339,"enjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,"
200,11,340,"just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.”"
200,11,341,As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt
200,11,342,"sacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink - offering, put"
200,11,343,"the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion."
200,11,344,Mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man
200,11,345,"on his own account from among the Taphians during his master’s absence,"
200,11,346,and had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either
200,11,347,to his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good
200,11,348,"things that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat and"
200,11,349,"drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all"
200,11,350,went to bed after having made a hearty supper.
200,11,351,"Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It"
200,11,352,"poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which"
200,11,353,"is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in"
200,11,354,"the excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and"
200,11,355,"give it him, or make one of his men give him one. “Listen to me,” said"
200,11,356,"he, “Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell"
200,11,357,you something. It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will
200,11,358,make even a wise man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and
200,11,359,"dance and say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as"
200,11,360,"I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were still young and strong as"
200,11,361,when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the
200,11,362,"leaders, but I was in command also, for the other two would have it so."
200,11,363,When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath
200,11,364,our armour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood
200,11,365,that grew about the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind
200,11,366,"blowing; the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields"
200,11,367,"were coated thick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts,"
200,11,368,"and slept comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders,"
200,11,369,"but I had carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I"
200,11,370,"should be too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and"
200,11,371,shield. When the night was two - thirds through and the stars had shifted
200,11,372,"their places, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and"
200,11,373,he at once gave me his ear.
200,11,374,"“‘Ulysses,’ said I, ‘this cold will be the death of me, for I have no"
200,11,375,cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my
200,11,376,"shirt, and I do not know what to do.’"
200,11,377,"“Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following"
200,11,378,plan:
200,11,379,"“‘Keep still,’ said he in a low voice, ‘or the others will hear you.’"
200,11,380,Then he raised his head on his elbow.
200,11,381,"“‘My friends,’ said he, ‘I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We"
200,11,382,are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell
200,11,383,Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.’
200,11,384,“On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running
200,11,385,"to the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough"
200,11,386,till morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in
200,11,387,"those days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak"
200,11,388,both out of good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier; but
200,11,389,now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby.”
200,11,390,"And Eumaeus answered, “Old man, you have told us an excellent story,"
200,11,391,and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the
200,11,392,"present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else"
200,11,393,"that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to - morrow"
200,11,394,"morning you have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for"
200,11,395,"we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has"
200,11,396,only one. When Ulysses’ son comes home again he will give you both
200,11,397,"cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.”"
200,11,398,With this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some
200,11,399,goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here
200,11,400,"Ulysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak"
200,11,401,that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.
200,11,402,"Thus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the"
200,11,403,"swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready to"
200,11,404,"go outside, and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his"
200,11,405,property during his master’s absence. First he slung his sword over his
200,11,406,brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also
200,11,407,"took the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of"
200,11,408,attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the
200,11,409,pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from
200,11,410,the North wind.
200,12,1,MINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON — HE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS
200,12,2,AT PYLOS AND BRINGS HIM TO ITHACA — ON LANDING HE GOES TO THE HUT OF
200,12,3,EUMAEUS.
200,12,4,But Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses’ son
200,12,5,that he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping
200,12,6,"in the forecourt of Menelaus’s house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but"
200,12,7,Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy
200,12,8,"father, so Minerva went close up to him and said:"
200,12,9,"“Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer,"
200,12,10,nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they
200,12,11,"will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a"
200,12,12,fool’s errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you wish to
200,12,13,find your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father
200,12,14,"and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus, who has given"
200,12,15,"her more than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his"
200,12,16,wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the
200,12,17,"house in spite of you, but you know what women are — they always want to"
200,12,18,"do the best they can for the man who marries them, and never give"
200,12,19,"another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their"
200,12,20,"father either when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and"
200,12,21,put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you
200,12,22,"have, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let"
200,12,23,me tell you also of another matter which you had better attend to. The
200,12,24,chief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait128
200,12,25,"between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean to kill you before you can"
200,12,26,reach home. I do not much think they will succeed; it is more likely
200,12,27,that some of those who are now eating up your property will find a
200,12,28,"grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship well away from"
200,12,29,the islands; the god who watches over you and protects you will send
200,12,30,you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on
200,12,31,"to the town, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge"
200,12,32,"of your pigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him,"
200,12,33,"therefore, for the night, and then send him to Penelope to tell her"
200,12,34,that you have got back safe from Pylos.”
200,12,35,Then she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with
200,12,36,"his heel to rouse him, and said, “Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the"
200,12,37,"horses to the chariot, for we must set off home.”129"
200,12,38,"But Pisistratus said, “No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive"
200,12,39,in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought
200,12,40,his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good
200,12,41,bye to us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never
200,12,42,forget a host who has shown him kindness.”
200,12,43,"As he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,"
200,12,44,"leaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put"
200,12,45,"on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his"
200,12,46,"shoulders, and went out to meet him. “Menelaus,” said he, “let me go"
200,12,47,"back now to my own country, for I want to get home.”"
200,12,48,"And Menelaus answered, “Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not"
200,12,49,detain you. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or
200,12,50,"too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a"
200,12,51,man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he
200,12,52,would like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in
200,12,53,"the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till I"
200,12,54,"can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you have"
200,12,55,yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient
200,12,56,dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once
200,12,57,more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out
200,12,58,"on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a"
200,12,59,"tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will"
200,12,60,conduct you myself through all our principal cities. No one will send
200,12,61,"us away empty handed; every one will give us something — a bronze tripod,"
200,12,62,"a couple of mules, or a gold cup.”"
200,12,63,"“Menelaus,” replied Telemachus, “I want to go home at once, for when I"
200,12,64,"came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while"
200,12,65,"looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that"
200,12,66,something valuable has been stolen during my absence.”
200,12,67,When Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to
200,12,68,prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At
200,12,69,"this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got"
200,12,70,"up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he"
200,12,71,"at once did. Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant store room,130"
200,12,72,"not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the"
200,12,73,"place where the treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double"
200,12,74,"cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing bowl."
200,12,75,Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses
200,12,76,"which she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was"
200,12,77,largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered
200,12,78,"like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. 131 Then they all"
200,12,79,"came back through the house again till they got to Telemachus, and"
200,12,80,"Menelaus said, “Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring"
200,12,81,you safely home according to your desire. I will now present you with
200,12,82,the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a
200,12,83,"mixing bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold,"
200,12,84,and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made me a
200,12,85,present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on
200,12,86,my return home. I should like to give it to you.”
200,12,87,"With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,"
200,12,88,while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before
200,12,89,him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.
200,12,90,"“I too, my son,” said she, “have something for you as a keepsake from"
200,12,91,the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.
200,12,92,"Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go"
200,12,93,back rejoicing to your own country and to your home.”
200,12,94,So saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then
200,12,95,"Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all as"
200,12,96,he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the
200,12,97,"house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought"
200,12,98,"them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver"
200,12,99,"basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside"
200,12,100,them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good
200,12,101,things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and
200,12,102,"gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine."
200,12,103,"Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,"
200,12,104,but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and
200,12,105,"Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot."
200,12,106,They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing
200,12,107,"gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came after them with a"
200,12,108,golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they might make a
200,12,109,drink - offering before they set out. He stood in front of the horses and
200,12,110,"pledged them, saying, “Farewell to both of you; see that you tell"
200,12,111,"Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind to me as any father"
200,12,112,could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy.”
200,12,113,"“We will be sure, sir,” answered Telemachus, “to tell him everything as"
200,12,114,soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses
200,12,115,"returned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very"
200,12,116,great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents I
200,12,117,am taking with me.”
200,12,118,As he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand — an eagle with a
200,12,119,great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm
200,12,120,yard — and all the men and women were running after it and shouting. It
200,12,121,came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands in front
200,12,122,"of the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their hearts took"
200,12,123,"comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, “Tell me, Menelaus, has"
200,12,124,heaven sent this omen for us or for you?”
200,12,125,Menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to
200,12,126,"make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, “I will read this"
200,12,127,"matter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it"
200,12,128,will come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred
200,12,129,"and has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled"
200,12,130,"far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge — if indeed he is"
200,12,131,not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors.”
200,12,132,"“May Jove so grant it,” replied Telemachus, “if it should prove to be"
200,12,133,"so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I am at"
200,12,134,home.”
200,12,135,As he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed
200,12,136,through the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon
200,12,137,their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and
200,12,138,"darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles"
200,12,139,"lived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they passed"
200,12,140,"the night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning,"
200,12,141,"rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their"
200,12,142,places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and
200,12,143,under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed
200,12,144,his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came
200,12,145,"to Pylos, and then Telemachus said:"
200,12,146,"“Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you."
200,12,147,"You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both"
200,12,148,"of an age, and this journey has brought us together still more closely;"
200,12,149,"do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I"
200,12,150,go to your father’s house he will try to keep me in the warmth of his
200,12,151,"good will towards me, and I must go home at once.”"
200,12,152,"Pisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he"
200,12,153,"deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus’s"
200,12,154,beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then
200,12,155,"he said, “Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also before I"
200,12,156,"can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am"
200,12,157,"sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you, and"
200,12,158,he will not go back without you. But he will be very angry.”
200,12,159,With this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians
200,12,160,"and soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and"
200,12,161,"gave his orders. “Now, my men,” said he, “get everything in order on"
200,12,162,"board the ship, and let us set out home.”"
200,12,163,"Thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as"
200,12,164,"Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva in"
200,12,165,"the ship’s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a"
200,12,166,"seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was"
200,12,167,"descended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep;"
200,12,168,"he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by"
200,12,169,the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held
200,12,170,"them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the"
200,12,171,"house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account of"
200,12,172,the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow
200,12,173,"that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped"
200,12,174,"with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the"
200,12,175,"wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his"
200,12,176,"brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos, where it was"
200,12,177,"ordained that he should reign over much people. There he married,"
200,12,178,"established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates and Mantius."
200,12,179,"Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, who was"
200,12,180,"dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live to old"
200,12,181,"age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman’s gifts. His sons"
200,12,182,"were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was"
200,12,183,"father to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off"
200,12,184,"Cleitus for his beauty’s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals,"
200,12,185,but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now
200,12,186,that Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to
200,12,187,"live in Hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied for all men."
200,12,188,"His son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was"
200,12,189,"making drink - offerings and praying in his ship. “Friend,” said he, “now"
200,12,190,"that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your"
200,12,191,"sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, I pray you"
200,12,192,also by your own head and by those of your followers tell me the truth
200,12,193,and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of your
200,12,194,town and parents.”
200,12,195,"Telemachus said, “I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and"
200,12,196,"my father is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come"
200,12,197,to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew
200,12,198,"together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a"
200,12,199,long time.”
200,12,200,"“I too,” answered Theoclymenus, “am an exile, for I have killed a man"
200,12,201,"of my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they"
200,12,202,have great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at
200,12,203,"their hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the"
200,12,204,"earth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship that"
200,12,205,"they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit.”"
200,12,206,"“I will not refuse you,” replied Telemachus, “if you wish to join us."
200,12,207,"Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according"
200,12,208,to what we have.”
200,12,209,On this he received Theoclymenus’ spear and laid it down on the deck of
200,12,210,"the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus"
200,12,211,sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them
200,12,212,"to catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They set"
200,12,213,"the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made it fast"
200,12,214,"with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of"
200,12,215,twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and
200,12,216,strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then
200,12,217,they passed by Crouni and Chalcis.
200,12,218,Presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel
200,12,219,"made a quick passage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the Epeans"
200,12,220,"rule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands,132 wondering"
200,12,221,within himself whether he should escape death or should be taken
200,12,222,prisoner.
200,12,223,Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the
200,12,224,"hut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat and"
200,12,225,"drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he"
200,12,226,"would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the"
200,12,227,station or pack him off to the city; so he said:
200,12,228,"“Eumaeus, and all of you, to - morrow I want to go away and begin begging"
200,12,229,"about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men. Give"
200,12,230,"me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with me"
200,12,231,and show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs
200,12,232,"must, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I"
200,12,233,should like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring news of her
200,12,234,husband to Queen Penelope. I could then go about among the suitors and
200,12,235,see if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should
200,12,236,soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and
200,12,237,believe when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury who gives grace
200,12,238,"and good name to the works of all men, there is no one living who would"
200,12,239,"make a more handy servant than I should — to put fresh wood on the fire,"
200,12,240,"chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and do all those services that"
200,12,241,poor men have to do for their betters.”
200,12,242,The swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. “Heaven help
200,12,243,"me,” he exclaimed, “what ever can have put such a notion as that into"
200,12,244,your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a
200,12,245,"certainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They"
200,12,246,would never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their
200,12,247,"servants are all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and"
200,12,248,"shirts, with well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables"
200,12,249,"are kept quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay"
200,12,250,"where you are, then; you are not in anybody’s way; I do not mind your"
200,12,251,"being here, no more do any of the others, and when Telemachus comes"
200,12,252,home he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you
200,12,253,want to go.”
200,12,254,"Ulysses answered, “I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to"
200,12,255,"me, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble;"
200,12,256,"there is nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still, when men"
200,12,257,have once got low down in the world they will go through a great deal
200,12,258,"on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since, however, you press me to"
200,12,259,"stay here and await the return of Telemachus, tell me about Ulysses’"
200,12,260,"mother, and his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he"
200,12,261,set out for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in
200,12,262,the house of Hades?”
200,12,263,"“I will tell you all about them,” replied Eumaeus, “Laertes is still"
200,12,264,"living and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully in his own house,"
200,12,265,"for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also"
200,12,266,"about the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him"
200,12,267,more than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end133 through
200,12,268,sorrow for her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by
200,12,269,"me come to such an end as she did. As long as she was still living,"
200,12,270,"though she was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking"
200,12,271,"her how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene,"
200,12,272,"the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and she"
200,12,273,"made little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they"
200,12,274,"sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me,"
200,12,275,my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for
200,12,276,"my feet, and sent me off into the country, but she was just as fond of"
200,12,277,me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to
200,12,278,prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have enough to eat
200,12,279,"and drink, and can find something for any respectable stranger who"
200,12,280,comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or deed out of my
200,12,281,"mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked people."
200,12,282,Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk with her;
200,12,283,"they like to have something to eat and drink at the house, and"
200,12,284,something too to take back with them into the country. This is what
200,12,285,will keep servants in a good humour.”
200,12,286,"Ulysses answered, “Then you must have been a very little fellow,"
200,12,287,"Eumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents."
200,12,288,"Tell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother"
200,12,289,"lived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you"
200,12,290,"were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for"
200,12,291,whatever your master gave them?”
200,12,292,"“Stranger,” replied Eumaeus, “as regards your question: sit still, make"
200,12,293,"yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The nights are"
200,12,294,now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and
200,12,295,"sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed till bed time,"
200,12,296,too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of the others wishes
200,12,297,to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then take my master’s
200,12,298,pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning. We too will sit
200,12,299,"here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one another stories"
200,12,300,"about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered much, and been"
200,12,301,"buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling the memory"
200,12,302,"of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question, then, my"
200,12,303,tale is as follows:
200,12,304,“You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above
200,12,305,"Ortygia,134 where the land begins to turn round and look in another"
200,12,306,"direction.135 It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good,"
200,12,307,"with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine"
200,12,308,"and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any"
200,12,309,"sickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them"
200,12,310,"with his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole"
200,12,311,"country is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus,"
200,12,312,"a man comparable to the gods, reigned over both."
200,12,313,“Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for
200,12,314,the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted
200,12,315,with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in
200,12,316,"my father’s house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant;"
200,12,317,these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing near
200,12,318,"their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman can"
200,12,319,"resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had"
200,12,320,"seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on this"
200,12,321,"she told him her father’s name. ‘I come from Sidon,’ said she, ‘and am"
200,12,322,"daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming"
200,12,323,"into the town from the country, some Taphian pirates seized me and took"
200,12,324,"me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man who owns this"
200,12,325,"house, and he gave them their price for me.’"
200,12,326,"“The man who had seduced her then said, ‘Would you like to come along"
200,12,327,with us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?
200,12,328,They are both alive and are said to be well off.’
200,12,329,"“‘I will do so gladly,’ answered she, ‘if you men will first swear me a"
200,12,330,solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.’
200,12,331,"“They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their"
200,12,332,"oath the woman said, ‘Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the"
200,12,333,"street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one"
200,12,334,"should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something."
200,12,335,"He would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep"
200,12,336,"your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can,"
200,12,337,and send me word when you have done loading. I will bring as much gold
200,12,338,"as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else also that I can"
200,12,339,do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good man of the
200,12,340,"house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I will carry him"
200,12,341,"off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of money for him if you"
200,12,342,take him and sell him in foreign parts.’
200,12,343,“On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole
200,12,344,"year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,"
200,12,345,"and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the"
200,12,346,"woman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father’s"
200,12,347,house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and
200,12,348,while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and
200,12,349,"bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went"
200,12,350,"back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the"
200,12,351,house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with the
200,12,352,"cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in"
200,12,353,attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public
200,12,354,"assembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the"
200,12,355,"bosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew no better. The sun"
200,12,356,"was now set, and darkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as"
200,12,357,"fast as we could till we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship"
200,12,358,was lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the
200,12,359,"sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did"
200,12,360,"we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the"
200,12,361,woman and she fell heavily down into the ship’s hold as though she were
200,12,362,a sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the
200,12,363,"seals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the"
200,12,364,"winds and waves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of"
200,12,365,"his chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon"
200,12,366,this country.”
200,12,367,"Ulysses answered, “Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes"
200,12,368,"with the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as"
200,12,369,"well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master, who"
200,12,370,sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good
200,12,371,"life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to city.”"
200,12,372,"Thus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for"
200,12,373,"sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his"
200,12,374,"crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast,"
200,12,375,and rowed the ship into the harbour.136 They cast out their mooring
200,12,376,"stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,"
200,12,377,"mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough"
200,12,378,"to eat and drink Telemachus said, “Take the ship on to the town, but"
200,12,379,"leave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my"
200,12,380,"farms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to"
200,12,381,"the city, and to - morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give"
200,12,382,you all a good dinner with meat and wine.” 137
200,12,383,"Then Theoclymenus said, “And what, my dear young friend, is to become"
200,12,384,"of me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or"
200,12,385,shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?”
200,12,386,"“At any other time,” replied Telemachus, “I should have bidden you go"
200,12,387,"to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the"
200,12,388,"present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I"
200,12,389,"shall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show"
200,12,390,"herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper"
200,12,391,"chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can"
200,12,392,"go to — I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held in the highest"
200,12,393,estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and the most
200,12,394,"persistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and"
200,12,395,"trying to take Ulysses’ place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows"
200,12,396,whether or no they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes
200,12,397,place.”
200,12,398,"As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand — a hawk, Apollo’s"
200,12,399,"messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore"
200,12,400,"them off,138 fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship."
200,12,401,On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.
200,12,402,"“Telemachus,” said he, “that bird did not fly on your right hand"
200,12,403,without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew
200,12,404,it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there
200,12,405,will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.”
200,12,406,"“I wish it may prove so,” answered Telemachus. “If it does, I will show"
200,12,407,you so much good will and give you so many presents that all who meet
200,12,408,you will congratulate you.”
200,12,409,"Then he said to his friend Piraeus, “Piraeus, son of Clytius, you have"
200,12,410,throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all those who
200,12,411,have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to
200,12,412,your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him.”
200,12,413,"And Piraeus answered, “Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you"
200,12,414,"please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack of"
200,12,415,hospitality.”
200,12,416,"As he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose"
200,12,417,"the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus"
200,12,418,"bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head of"
200,12,419,sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the
200,12,420,"hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city as"
200,12,421,"they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as he"
200,12,422,"could, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds of swine"
200,12,423,"were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who was so"
200,12,424,devoted a servant to his master.
200,13,1,ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.
200,13,2,Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were
200,13,3,"were getting breakfast ready at daybreak, for they had sent the men out"
200,13,4,"with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark but"
200,13,5,"fawned upon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing"
200,13,6,"that the dogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus:"
200,13,7,"“Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of"
200,13,8,"your acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and"
200,13,9,not barking.”
200,13,10,The words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the
200,13,11,"door. Eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing"
200,13,12,"wine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his"
200,13,13,"head and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not"
200,13,14,"be more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old"
200,13,15,"age, after ten years’ absence in a foreign country and after having"
200,13,16,"gone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as"
200,13,17,"though he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:"
200,13,18,"“So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I"
200,13,19,heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you
200,13,20,"any more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good"
200,13,21,look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into
200,13,22,the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town
200,13,23,generally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the
200,13,24,suitors are doing.”
200,13,25,"“So be it, old friend,” answered Telemachus, “but I am come now because"
200,13,26,"I want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her old"
200,13,27,"home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed of"
200,13,28,Ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.”
200,13,29,"“She is still at the house,” replied Eumaeus, “grieving and breaking"
200,13,30,"her heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually.”"
200,13,31,"As he spoke he took Telemachus’ spear, whereon he crossed the stone"
200,13,32,threshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place
200,13,33,"as he entered, but Telemachus checked him; “Sit down, stranger,” said"
200,13,34,"he, “I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay"
200,13,35,it for me.”
200,13,36,"Ulysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green"
200,13,37,brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for
200,13,38,Telemachus to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of
200,13,39,"cold meat, the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he"
200,13,40,filled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine
200,13,41,"also in bowls of ivy - wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they"
200,13,42,"laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon"
200,13,43,"as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,"
200,13,44,"“Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew bring"
200,13,45,"him to Ithaca, and who were they? — for assuredly he did not come here by"
200,13,46,land.”
200,13,47,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “My son, I will tell you the"
200,13,48,"real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great"
200,13,49,"traveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,"
200,13,50,"and has taken refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands."
200,13,51,"Do whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your"
200,13,52,suppliant.”
200,13,53,"“I am very much distressed,” said Telemachus, “by what you have just"
200,13,54,"told me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young,"
200,13,55,and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My
200,13,56,mother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look
200,13,57,after the house out of respect for public opinion and the memory of her
200,13,58,"husband, or whether the time is now come for her to take the best man"
200,13,59,"of those who are wooing her, and the one who will make her the most"
200,13,60,"advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to your station I"
200,13,61,"will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals,"
200,13,62,and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can keep
200,13,63,"him here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food that he"
200,13,64,may be no burden on you and on your men; but I will not have him go
200,13,65,"near the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure to ill treat"
200,13,66,him in a way that would greatly grieve me; no matter how valiant a man
200,13,67,"may be he can do nothing against numbers, for they will be too strong"
200,13,68,for him.”
200,13,69,"Then Ulysses said, “Sir, it is right that I should say something"
200,13,70,myself. I am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent
200,13,71,way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you
200,13,72,"are. Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some god"
200,13,73,set your people against you? May you not complain of your brothers — for
200,13,74,"it is to these that a man may look for support, however great his"
200,13,75,quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my present
200,13,76,"mind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would"
200,13,77,"rather some one came and cut my head off, but I would go to the house"
200,13,78,and be the bane of every one of these men.139 If they were too many for
200,13,79,me — I being single - handed — I would rather die fighting in my own house
200,13,80,"than see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly"
200,13,81,"maltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an"
200,13,82,"unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose"
200,13,83,for an end that shall never be accomplished.”
200,13,84,"And Telemachus answered, “I will tell you truly everything. There is no"
200,13,85,"enmity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to"
200,13,86,whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove
200,13,87,"has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius,"
200,13,88,and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses
200,13,89,"who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been of"
200,13,90,any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of
200,13,91,"numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands,"
200,13,92,"Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca"
200,13,93,"itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying court to my"
200,13,94,"mother, who will neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor"
200,13,95,"yet bring matters to an end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and"
200,13,96,"before long will do so with myself into the bargain. The issue,"
200,13,97,"however, rests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once"
200,13,98,and tell Penelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell it
200,13,99,"to herself alone, and then come back here without letting any one else"
200,13,100,"know, for there are many who are plotting mischief against me.”"
200,13,101,"“I understand and heed you,” replied Eumaeus; “you need instruct me no"
200,13,102,"further, only as I am going that way say whether I had not better let"
200,13,103,poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend the
200,13,104,"work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he"
200,13,105,would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me
200,13,106,that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten
200,13,107,"nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits"
200,13,108,weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.”
200,13,109,"“More’s the pity,” answered Telemachus, “I am sorry for him, but we"
200,13,110,must leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything
200,13,111,"their own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return of"
200,13,112,"my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back again,"
200,13,113,and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother to send
200,13,114,"one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it"
200,13,115,from her.”
200,13,116,"Thus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,"
200,13,117,"bound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched him"
200,13,118,"well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a"
200,13,119,"woman — fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the entry,"
200,13,120,"and revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see her, and"
200,13,121,"knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves be seen"
200,13,122,"by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs, for they did not"
200,13,123,"bark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards."
200,13,124,She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon
200,13,125,he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the
200,13,126,yards. Then she said to him:
200,13,127,"“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your"
200,13,128,"son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the"
200,13,129,"destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be"
200,13,130,"long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.”"
200,13,131,As she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a
200,13,132,fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him
200,13,133,"younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,"
200,13,134,"filled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she"
200,13,135,went away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded
200,13,136,"when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking"
200,13,137,upon a god.
200,13,138,"“Stranger,” said he, “how suddenly you have changed from what you were"
200,13,139,a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour is not
200,13,140,the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If
200,13,141,"so, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings"
200,13,142,of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.”
200,13,143,"And Ulysses said, “I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am"
200,13,144,"your father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the"
200,13,145,hands of lawless men.”
200,13,146,"As he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to the"
200,13,147,"ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. But Telemachus could"
200,13,148,"not yet believe that it was his father, and said:"
200,13,149,"“You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes"
200,13,150,that I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself
200,13,151,"contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young"
200,13,152,"at a moment’s notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you were"
200,13,153,"old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from"
200,13,154,heaven.”
200,13,155,"Ulysses answered, “Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably"
200,13,156,astonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will
200,13,157,"come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and"
200,13,158,much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.
200,13,159,"What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who"
200,13,160,"does with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At one"
200,13,161,"moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with"
200,13,162,good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in
200,13,163,heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.”
200,13,164,"As he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father"
200,13,165,and wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like
200,13,166,eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their
200,13,167,"half fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the"
200,13,168,sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had not
200,13,169,"suddenly said, “In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you"
200,13,170,to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be — for you
200,13,171,cannot have come by land?”
200,13,172,"“I will tell you the truth, my son,” replied Ulysses. “It was the"
200,13,173,"Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the"
200,13,174,habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took
200,13,175,"me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after"
200,13,176,"giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by"
200,13,177,"heaven’s mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on"
200,13,178,the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing our
200,13,179,"enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with their"
200,13,180,"number, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can then turn"
200,13,181,"the matter over in my mind, and see whether we two can fight the whole"
200,13,182,"body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to help us.”"
200,13,183,"To this Telemachus answered, “Father, I have always heard of your"
200,13,184,"renown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a"
200,13,185,very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot
200,13,186,"stand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor"
200,13,187,"twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at"
200,13,188,"once. There are fifty - two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have"
200,13,189,six servants; from Same there are twenty - four; twenty young Achaeans
200,13,190,"from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born."
200,13,191,"They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve"
200,13,192,"at table. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to"
200,13,193,"rue your coming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some"
200,13,194,one who would be willing to come and help us.”
200,13,195,"“Listen to me,” replied Ulysses, “and think whether Minerva and her"
200,13,196,"father Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some"
200,13,197,one else as well.”
200,13,198,"“Those whom you have named,” answered Telemachus, “are a couple of good"
200,13,199,"allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power"
200,13,200,over both gods and men.”
200,13,201,"“These two,” continued Ulysses, “will not keep long out of the fray,"
200,13,202,"when the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return"
200,13,203,"home early to - morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before."
200,13,204,Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a
200,13,205,"miserable old beggar. If you see them ill treating me, steel your heart"
200,13,206,against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of
200,13,207,"the house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently"
200,13,208,trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to
200,13,209,"you, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and"
200,13,210,"lay my saying to your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I"
200,13,211,"will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all"
200,13,212,the armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room.
200,13,213,Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say
200,13,214,"that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as"
200,13,215,"it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become"
200,13,216,soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you
200,13,217,"are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that"
200,13,218,they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and
200,13,219,"wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But"
200,13,220,"leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of"
200,13,221,oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and
200,13,222,Minerva will then soon quiet these people. There is also another
200,13,223,"matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let"
200,13,224,"no one know that Ulysses is within the house — neither Laertes, nor yet"
200,13,225,"the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let"
200,13,226,"you and me exploit the women alone, and let us also make trial of some"
200,13,227,"other of the men servants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is"
200,13,228,against us.”
200,13,229,"“Father,” replied Telemachus, “you will come to know me by and by, and"
200,13,230,"when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not think,"
200,13,231,"however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us."
200,13,232,Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round of the farms
200,13,233,"and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting your"
200,13,234,estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all
200,13,235,"means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I am not in"
200,13,236,favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend to that later
200,13,237,"on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will support you.”"
200,13,238,"Thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought"
200,13,239,Telemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When
200,13,240,they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land;
200,13,241,"their servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all"
200,13,242,the presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell
200,13,243,"Penelope that Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the"
200,13,244,ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.
200,13,245,This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the
200,13,246,"same errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the"
200,13,247,servant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting
200,13,248,"women, “Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos”; but Eumaeus went"
200,13,249,"close up to Penelope, and said privately all that her son had bidden"
200,13,250,him tell her. When he had given his message he left the house with its
200,13,251,outbuildings and went back to his pigs again.
200,13,252,"The suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they went"
200,13,253,"outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held a"
200,13,254,"council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the"
200,13,255,first to speak.
200,13,256,"“My friends,” said he, “this voyage of Telemachus’s is a very serious"
200,13,257,"matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however,"
200,13,258,"let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send"
200,13,259,after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.”
200,13,260,He had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and saw
200,13,261,"the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails, and"
200,13,262,"putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others, “We need"
200,13,263,"not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told"
200,13,264,"them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake her.”"
200,13,265,On this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the
200,13,266,"ship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they"
200,13,267,"went up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any"
200,13,268,"one old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes,"
200,13,269,spoke first.
200,13,270,"“Good heavens,” said he, “see how the gods have saved this man from"
200,13,271,destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day
200,13,272,"long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep, but"
200,13,273,waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and
200,13,274,killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let us
200,13,275,consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our
200,13,276,"affair is never likely to come off while he is alive, for he is very"
200,13,277,"shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our side. We must make"
200,13,278,haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time
200,13,279,"in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will tell all the"
200,13,280,"world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to take him. The people"
200,13,281,will not like this when they come to know of it; we must see that they
200,13,282,"do us no hurt, nor drive us from our own country into exile. Let us try"
200,13,283,"and lay hold of him either on his farm away from the town, or on the"
200,13,284,"road hither. Then we can divide up his property amongst us, and let his"
200,13,285,mother and the man who marries her have the house. If this does not
200,13,286,"please you, and you wish Telemachus to live on and hold his father’s"
200,13,287,"property, then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this"
200,13,288,"way, but must make our offers to Penelope each from his own house, and"
200,13,289,"she can marry the man who will give the most for her, and whose lot it"
200,13,290,is to win her.”
200,13,291,They all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the
200,13,292,"son of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among"
200,13,293,all the suitors from the wheat - growing and well grassed island of
200,13,294,"Dulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope"
200,13,295,"than that of any of the other suitors, for he was a man of good natural"
200,13,296,"disposition. “My friends,” said he, speaking to them plainly and in all"
200,13,297,"honestly, “I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous"
200,13,298,thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of
200,13,299,"the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to"
200,13,300,"kill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they"
200,13,301,"dissuade us, I would have you hold your hands.”"
200,13,302,"Thus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose"
200,13,303,"forthwith and went to the house of Ulysses, where they took their"
200,13,304,accustomed seats.
200,13,305,Then Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She
200,13,306,"knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had"
200,13,307,overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to
200,13,308,"the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she"
200,13,309,stood by one of the bearing - posts supporting the roof of the cloister
200,13,310,"holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:"
200,13,311,"“Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best"
200,13,312,"speaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are"
200,13,313,"nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the death of"
200,13,314,"Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove"
200,13,315,himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one another. Do
200,13,316,you not remember how your father fled to this house in fear of the
200,13,317,"people, who were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian"
200,13,318,pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They
200,13,319,"wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses"
200,13,320,"stayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour"
200,13,321,"his property without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his"
200,13,322,"wife and trying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the"
200,13,323,others also.”
200,13,324,"To this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, “Take heart, Queen Penelope"
200,13,325,"daughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters."
200,13,326,"The man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon"
200,13,327,"your son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the"
200,13,328,earth. I say — and it shall surely be — that my spear shall be reddened
200,13,329,"with his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees, held"
200,13,330,"wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands."
200,13,331,"Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing"
200,13,332,"to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him"
200,13,333,"from the gods, he cannot escape it.” He said this to quiet her, but in"
200,13,334,reality he was plotting against Telemachus.
200,13,335,Then Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva
200,13,336,shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses
200,13,337,"and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were"
200,13,338,helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to
200,13,339,"Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand, and clad"
200,13,340,"him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might"
200,13,341,"recognise him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope."
200,13,342,"Telemachus was the first to speak. “So you have got back, Eumaeus,”"
200,13,343,"said he. “What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or"
200,13,344,"are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?”"
200,13,345,"“I did not think of asking about that,” replied Eumaeus, “when I was in"
200,13,346,the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I
200,13,347,"could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he"
200,13,348,"was the first to tell the news to your mother, but I can say what I saw"
200,13,349,with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury
200,13,350,above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with a number of
200,13,351,"men in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought it was the"
200,13,352,"suitors, but I cannot be sure.”"
200,13,353,"On hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus"
200,13,354,could not see him.
200,13,355,"Then, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they"
200,13,356,"ate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As"
200,13,357,"soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest"
200,13,358,and enjoyed the boon of sleep.
200,14,1,TELEMACHUS AND HIS MOTHER MEET — ULYSSES AND EUMAEUS COME DOWN TO THE
200,14,2,"TOWN, AND ULYSSES IS INSULTED BY MELANTHIUS — HE IS RECOGNISED BY THE DOG"
200,14,3,ARGOS — HE IS INSULTED AND PRESENTLY STRUCK BY ANTINOUS WITH A
200,14,4,STOOL — PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.
200,14,5,"When the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus"
200,14,6,"bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for"
200,14,7,"he wanted to go into the city. “Old friend,” said he to the swineherd,"
200,14,8,"“I will now go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will"
200,14,9,never leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate
200,14,10,"stranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who"
200,14,11,will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough of my
200,14,12,"own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes him angry"
200,14,13,"so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.”"
200,14,14,"Then Ulysses said, “Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can"
200,14,15,"always do better in town than country, for any one who likes can give"
200,14,16,him something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck
200,14,17,and call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told
200,14,18,"him, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire,"
200,14,19,and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly
200,14,20,"thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you"
200,14,21,say the city is some way off.”
200,14,22,"On this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge"
200,14,23,upon the suitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a
200,14,24,"bearing - post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister"
200,14,25,"itself, and went inside."
200,14,26,Nurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting
200,14,27,"the fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to"
200,14,28,"him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and"
200,14,29,shoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking like
200,14,30,"Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son. She"
200,14,31,"kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, “Light of my eyes,”"
200,14,32,"she cried as she spoke fondly to him, “so you are come home again; I"
200,14,33,made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of your
200,14,34,having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining
200,14,35,"my consent. But come, tell me what you saw.”"
200,14,36,"“Do not scold me, mother,” answered Telemachus, “nor vex me, seeing"
200,14,37,"what a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress,"
200,14,38,"go upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs"
200,14,39,to all the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the
200,14,40,suitors. I must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger
200,14,41,"who has come back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and"
200,14,42,told Piraeus to take him home and look after him till I could come for
200,14,43,him myself.”
200,14,44,"She heeded her son’s words, washed her face, changed her dress, and"
200,14,45,vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would only
200,14,46,vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.
200,14,47,"Telemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand — not"
200,14,48,"alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him with a"
200,14,49,presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went
200,14,50,"by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths"
200,14,51,"and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went to sit with"
200,14,52,"Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his father’s house,"
200,14,53,and they made him tell them all that had happened to him. Then Piraeus
200,14,54,"came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted through the town to the"
200,14,55,"place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once joined them. Piraeus was"
200,14,56,"first to speak: “Telemachus,” said he, “I wish you would send some of"
200,14,57,your women to my house to take away the presents Menelaus gave you.”
200,14,58,"“We do not know, Piraeus,” answered Telemachus, “what may happen. If"
200,14,59,"the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,"
200,14,60,I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people
200,14,61,"should get hold of them. If on the other hand I managed to kill them, I"
200,14,62,shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.”
200,14,63,With these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they got
200,14,64,"there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the"
200,14,65,"baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed"
200,14,66,"them, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at"
200,14,67,table. A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden
200,14,68,"ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands;"
200,14,69,and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them
200,14,70,bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.
200,14,71,"Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the"
200,14,72,"bearing - posts of the cloister, and spinning. Then they laid their hands"
200,14,73,"on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had"
200,14,74,enough to eat and drink Penelope said:
200,14,75,"“Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which"
200,14,76,"I have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set out"
200,14,77,"for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear"
200,14,78,"to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether or no you had"
200,14,79,been able to hear anything about the return of your father.”
200,14,80,"“I will tell you then truth,” replied her son. “We went to Pylos and"
200,14,81,"saw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as"
200,14,82,though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long
200,14,83,absence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word from
200,14,84,"any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. He sent"
200,14,85,"me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw"
200,14,86,"Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in"
200,14,87,heaven’s wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was that
200,14,88,"had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth, whereon"
200,14,89,"he said, ‘So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man’s bed? A hind"
200,14,90,"might as well lay her new - born young in the lair of a lion, and then go"
200,14,91,"off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he"
200,14,92,"comes back to his lair, will make short work with the pair of them, and"
200,14,93,"so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and"
200,14,94,"Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with"
200,14,95,"Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Greeks"
200,14,96,"cheered him — if he is still such, and were to come near these suitors,"
200,14,97,they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your
200,14,98,"question, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the"
200,14,99,"old man of the sea told me, so much will I tell you in full. He said he"
200,14,100,could see Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the
200,14,101,"nymph Calypso, who was keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his"
200,14,102,"home, for he had no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.’ This"
200,14,103,"was what Menelaus told me, and when I had heard his story I came away;"
200,14,104,the gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.”
200,14,105,With these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus said
200,14,106,to her:
200,14,107,"“Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things;"
200,14,108,"listen therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide"
200,14,109,"nothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the"
200,14,110,"rites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come,"
200,14,111,"that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about the"
200,14,112,"country or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil deeds"
200,14,113,and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen when I
200,14,114,"was on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about it.”"
200,14,115,"“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true, you"
200,14,116,shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you
200,14,117,shall congratulate you.”
200,14,118,"Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, or"
200,14,119,aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the
200,14,120,"house, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was now"
200,14,121,"time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the"
200,14,122,"town from all the country round, 140 with their shepherds as usual,"
200,14,123,"then Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited upon them"
200,14,124,"at table, said, “Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport,"
200,14,125,"so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing,"
200,14,126,at dinner time.”
200,14,127,"They left their sports as he told them, and when they were within the"
200,14,128,"house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and then"
200,14,129,"sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and"
200,14,130,well grown.141 Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime
200,14,131,"Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the"
200,14,132,"swineherd said, “Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town"
200,14,133,"to - day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I should have"
200,14,134,"liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my master"
200,14,135,"tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from one’s"
200,14,136,"master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad"
200,14,137,day; it will be night again directly and then you will find it
200,14,138,colder.”142
200,14,139,"“I know, and understand you,” replied Ulysses; “you need say no more."
200,14,140,"Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it to"
200,14,141,"walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.”"
200,14,142,"As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,"
200,14,143,"by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his"
200,14,144,"liking. The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs"
200,14,145,and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his
200,14,146,"master followed after, looking like some broken down old tramp as he"
200,14,147,"leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When they had"
200,14,148,"got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city, they reached"
200,14,149,the fountain from which the citizens drew their water. This had been
200,14,150,"made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a grove of"
200,14,151,"water - loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and the clear"
200,14,152,"cold water came down to it from a rock high up,143 while above the"
200,14,153,"fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers used"
200,14,154,to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as he was
200,14,155,"driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors’"
200,14,156,"dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus and"
200,14,157,"Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which"
200,14,158,made Ulysses very angry.
200,14,159,"“There you go,” cried he, “and a precious pair you are. See how heaven"
200,14,160,"brings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master"
200,14,161,"swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make any"
200,14,162,one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never won
200,14,163,"a prize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his"
200,14,164,"shoulders against every man’s door post, and begging, not for swords"
200,14,165,"and cauldrons144 like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth"
200,14,166,"begging for. If you would give him to me for a hand on my station, he"
200,14,167,"might do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the"
200,14,168,"kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but"
200,14,169,he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he
200,14,170,"will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, to feed his"
200,14,171,"insatiable belly. I say, therefore — and it shall surely be — if he goes"
200,14,172,near Ulysses’ house he will get his head broken by the stools they will
200,14,173,"fling at him, till they turn him out.”"
200,14,174,"On this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure"
200,14,175,"wantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path."
200,14,176,For a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill him
200,14,177,"with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains out; he"
200,14,178,"resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but the"
200,14,179,"swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting up his"
200,14,180,hands and praying to heaven as he did so.
200,14,181,"“Fountain nymphs,” he cried, “children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned"
200,14,182,"you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my"
200,14,183,prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to the
200,14,184,swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting
200,14,185,people — gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin
200,14,186,through bad shepherding.”
200,14,187,"Then Melanthius the goatherd answered, “You ill conditioned cur, what"
200,14,188,are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship
200,14,189,"and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket the"
200,14,190,money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike
200,14,191,"Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I"
200,14,192,am that Ulysses will never come home again.”
200,14,193,"With this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went"
200,14,194,quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he got
200,14,195,there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite
200,14,196,"Eurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. The servants"
200,14,197,"brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread"
200,14,198,before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd came
200,14,199,"up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius was"
200,14,200,just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold of the
200,14,201,"swineherd’s hand, and said:"
200,14,202,"“Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how far"
200,14,203,"you go, you will find few like it. One building keeps following on"
200,14,204,after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round
200,14,205,"it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it would be"
200,14,206,"a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that there"
200,14,207,"are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast"
200,14,208,"meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods have made to go along"
200,14,209,with feasting.”
200,14,210,"Then Eumaeus said, “You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally"
200,14,211,do; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside
200,14,212,"first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you"
200,14,213,"wait here and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one may"
200,14,214,"see you loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider"
200,14,215,this matter I pray you.”
200,14,216,"And Ulysses answered, “I understand and heed. Go in first and leave me"
200,14,217,here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things
200,14,218,thrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that
200,14,219,"I am case - hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot"
200,14,220,hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives
200,14,221,much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted
200,14,222,"out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other people.”"
200,14,223,"As they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his"
200,14,224,"head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred"
200,14,225,"before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him."
200,14,226,In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went
200,14,227,"hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone"
200,14,228,he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in
200,14,229,front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to
200,14,230,manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw
200,14,231,"Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he"
200,14,232,could not get close up to his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the
200,14,233,"other side of the yard, he dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus"
200,14,234,"seeing it, and said:"
200,14,235,"“Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:"
200,14,236,"his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he"
200,14,237,"only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept"
200,14,238,merely for show?”
200,14,239,"“This hound,” answered Eumaeus, “belonged to him who has died in a far"
200,14,240,"country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would"
200,14,241,soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the
200,14,242,forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But
200,14,243,"now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and"
200,14,244,the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when their
200,14,245,"master’s hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes half the goodness"
200,14,246,out of a man when he makes a slave of him.”
200,14,247,As he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the
200,14,248,"suitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master."
200,14,249,"Telemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him"
200,14,250,to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying
200,14,251,near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he
200,14,252,"picked it up, brought it to Telemachus’s table, and sat down opposite"
200,14,253,"him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave him bread from"
200,14,254,the bread - basket.
200,14,255,"Immediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor"
200,14,256,"miserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in"
200,14,257,rags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash - wood just inside the doors
200,14,258,"leading from the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing - post"
200,14,259,"of cypress - wood which the carpenter had skilfully planed, and had made"
200,14,260,to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the
200,14,261,"bread - basket, with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and"
200,14,262,"said to Eumaeus, “Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the"
200,14,263,"round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be"
200,14,264,shamefaced.”
200,14,265,"So Eumaeus went up to him and said, “Stranger, Telemachus sends you"
200,14,266,"this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for"
200,14,267,beggars must not be shamefaced.”
200,14,268,"Ulysses answered, “May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and"
200,14,269,fulfil the desire of his heart.”
200,14,270,"Then with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it"
200,14,271,on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the
200,14,272,"bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left off. The"
200,14,273,"suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and"
200,14,274,"prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors, that"
200,14,275,"he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the"
200,14,276,bad; but come what might she was not going to save a single one of
200,14,277,"them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left to right,"
200,14,278,and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar.
200,14,279,"Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another"
200,14,280,who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius
200,14,281,"said, “Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about"
200,14,282,"him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I"
200,14,283,"know nothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from.”"
200,14,284,"On this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. “You precious idiot,” he"
200,14,285,"cried, “what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps"
200,14,286,and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think
200,14,287,it a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master’s
200,14,288,property — and must you needs bring this man as well?”
200,14,289,"And Eumaeus answered, “Antinous, your birth is good but your words"
200,14,290,evil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to
200,14,291,"invite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who"
200,14,292,"can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a"
200,14,293,bard who can charm us with his singing? Such men are welcome all the
200,14,294,"world over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry"
200,14,295,him. You are always harder on Ulysses’ servants than any of the other
200,14,296,"suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as"
200,14,297,Telemachus and Penelope are alive and here.”
200,14,298,"But Telemachus said, “Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the"
200,14,299,"bitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.”"
200,14,300,"Then turning to Antinous he said, “Antinous, you take as much care of"
200,14,301,my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this
200,14,302,stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and
200,14,303,give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind
200,14,304,"my mother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you"
200,14,305,"will not do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself"
200,14,306,than of giving them to other people.”
200,14,307,"“What do you mean, Telemachus,” replied Antinous, “by this swaggering"
200,14,308,"talk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would"
200,14,309,not come here again for another three months.”
200,14,310,As he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from
200,14,311,"under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but"
200,14,312,"the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with"
200,14,313,"bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold"
200,14,314,"and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to"
200,14,315,Antinous and said:
200,14,316,"“Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you"
200,14,317,"seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be"
200,14,318,"the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too"
200,14,319,"was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I"
200,14,320,"gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor"
200,14,321,"what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things"
200,14,322,"which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it"
200,14,323,pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving
200,14,324,robbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I
200,14,325,"stationed my ships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them"
200,14,326,"and keep guard over them, while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from"
200,14,327,every point of vantage.
200,14,328,"“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and"
200,14,329,"ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their"
200,14,330,"wives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city,"
200,14,331,"and when they heard the war - cry, the people came out at daybreak till"
200,14,332,"the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam"
200,14,333,"of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no"
200,14,334,"longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The"
200,14,335,"Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced"
200,14,336,"labour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them,"
200,14,337,"to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man in"
200,14,338,Cyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.”
200,14,339,"Then Antinous said, “What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague"
200,14,340,"us during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court,145 or I"
200,14,341,will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and
200,14,342,"importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given you"
200,14,343,"lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to be free"
200,14,344,with other people’s property when there is plenty of it.”
200,14,345,"On this Ulysses began to move off, and said, “Your looks, my fine sir,"
200,14,346,are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would
200,14,347,"not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in"
200,14,348,"another man’s, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you"
200,14,349,to give him even a piece of bread.”
200,14,350,"This made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, “You shall"
200,14,351,pay for this before you get clear of the court.” With these words he
200,14,352,"threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder blade near"
200,14,353,the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not
200,14,354,"even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his"
200,14,355,"revenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there, laying"
200,14,356,his well filled wallet at his feet.
200,14,357,"“Listen to me,” he cried, “you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may"
200,14,358,speak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he gets
200,14,359,"hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle; and"
200,14,360,"even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly,"
200,14,361,"which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor have"
200,14,362,"gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may come to"
200,14,363,a bad end before his marriage.”
200,14,364,"“Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off"
200,14,365,"elsewhere,” shouted Antinous. “If you say more I will have you dragged"
200,14,366,"hand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you"
200,14,367,alive.”
200,14,368,"The other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young"
200,14,369,"men said, “Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a"
200,14,370,tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some
200,14,371,god — and we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as
200,14,372,"people from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who do"
200,14,373,amiss and who righteously.”146
200,14,374,"Thus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile"
200,14,375,Telemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his
200,14,376,"father, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence"
200,14,377,and brooded on his revenge.
200,14,378,Now when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the
200,14,379,"banqueting - cloister, she said before her maids, “Would that Apollo"
200,14,380,"would so strike you, Antinous,” and her waiting woman Eurynome"
200,14,381,"answered, “If our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would"
200,14,382,"ever again see the sun rise.” Then Penelope said, “Nurse,147 I hate"
200,14,383,"every single one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I"
200,14,384,hate Antinous like the darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate
200,14,385,tramp has come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else
200,14,386,"has given him something to put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him"
200,14,387,on the right shoulder - blade with a footstool.”
200,14,388,"Thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in the"
200,14,389,meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the
200,14,390,"swineherd and said, “Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here, I"
200,14,391,want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled
200,14,392,"much, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.”"
200,14,393,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “If these Achaeans, Madam,"
200,14,394,"would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his"
200,14,395,"adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,"
200,14,396,"which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,"
200,14,397,and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had
200,14,398,"been the most heaven - taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips"
200,14,399,"all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I sat"
200,14,400,in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship
200,14,401,"between his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete"
200,14,402,"where the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither"
200,14,403,and thither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has
200,14,404,heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the
200,14,405,"Thesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth home with him.”"
200,14,406,"“Call him here, then,” said Penelope, “that I too may hear his story."
200,14,407,"As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they"
200,14,408,"will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine remain"
200,14,409,"unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume them, while"
200,14,410,"they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen,"
200,14,411,"sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a"
200,14,412,thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such
200,14,413,"recklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect us. If he were to"
200,14,414,"come again, he and his son would soon have their revenge.”"
200,14,415,As she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house
200,14,416,"resounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to"
200,14,417,"Eumaeus, “Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed"
200,14,418,just as I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are
200,14,419,"going to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore"
200,14,420,"I say, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the"
200,14,421,stranger is speaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of
200,14,422,good wear.”
200,14,423,"When Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, “Father"
200,14,424,"stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you;"
200,14,425,"she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her"
200,14,426,"about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the"
200,14,427,"truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things"
200,14,428,"that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that"
200,14,429,"to fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting those give"
200,14,430,that will.”
200,14,431,"“I will tell Penelope,” answered Ulysses, “nothing but what is strictly"
200,14,432,"true. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him in"
200,14,433,"affliction, but I am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel"
200,14,434,"suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now,"
200,14,435,"moreover, as I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man"
200,14,436,"gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any"
200,14,437,"one else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait"
200,14,438,"till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my"
200,14,439,"clothes are worn very thin — you know they are, for you have seen them"
200,14,440,ever since I first asked you to help me — she can then ask me about the
200,14,441,return of her husband.”
200,14,442,"The swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she"
200,14,443,"saw him cross the threshold, “Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus?"
200,14,444,"Is he afraid that some one will ill - treat him, or is he shy of coming"
200,14,445,inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.”
200,14,446,"To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “The stranger is quite"
200,14,447,"reasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one"
200,14,448,"else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much"
200,14,449,"better, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when you can"
200,14,450,hear him and talk to him as you will.”
200,14,451,"“The man is no fool,” answered Penelope, “it would very likely be as he"
200,14,452,"says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world as"
200,14,453,these men are.”
200,14,454,"When she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he had"
200,14,455,explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in his ear
200,14,456,"so that none could overhear him, “My dear sir, I will now go back to"
200,14,457,"the pigs, to see after your property and my own business. You will look"
200,14,458,"to what is going on here, but above all be careful to keep out of"
200,14,459,"danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove bring them"
200,14,460,to a bad end before they do us a mischief.”
200,14,461,"“Very well,” replied Telemachus, “go home when you have had your"
200,14,462,"dinner, and in the morning come here with the victims we are to"
200,14,463,sacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.”
200,14,464,"On this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his"
200,14,465,"dinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table, and"
200,14,466,"went back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to"
200,14,467,"amuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting on"
200,14,468,towards evening.
200,15,1,THE FIGHT WITH IRUS — ULYSSES WARNS AMPHINOMUS — PENELOPE GETS PRESENTS
200,15,2,FROM THE SUITORS — THE BRAZIERS — ULYSSES REBUKES EURYMACHUS.
200,15,3,Now there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all over
200,15,4,"the city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton and"
200,15,5,"drunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he was a great"
200,15,6,"hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother gave him,"
200,15,7,"was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called him Irus,148 because"
200,15,8,he used to run errands for any one who would send him. As soon as he
200,15,9,"came he began to insult Ulysses, and to try and drive him out of his"
200,15,10,own house.
200,15,11,"“Be off, old man,” he cried, “from the doorway, or you shall be dragged"
200,15,12,out neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me the
200,15,13,"wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do"
200,15,14,"so? Get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to blows.”"
200,15,15,"Ulysses frowned on him and said, “My friend, I do you no manner of"
200,15,16,"harm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room"
200,15,17,"enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me"
200,15,18,things that are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another
200,15,19,"tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and"
200,15,20,"by. Do not, however, talk too much about fighting or you will incense"
200,15,21,"me, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood."
200,15,22,"I shall have more peace tomorrow if I do, for you will not come to the"
200,15,23,house of Ulysses any more.”
200,15,24,"Irus was very angry and answered, “You filthy glutton, you run on"
200,15,25,trippingly like an old fish - fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands
200,15,26,"about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar’s"
200,15,27,"tusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and"
200,15,28,look on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much younger
200,15,29,than yourself.”
200,15,30,Thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front
200,15,31,"of the doorway,149 and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed"
200,15,32,"heartily and said to the others, “This is the finest sport that you"
200,15,33,ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house. The
200,15,34,"stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight, let us set"
200,15,35,them on to do so at once.”
200,15,36,"The suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged"
200,15,37,"tramps. “Listen to me,” said Antinous, “there are some goats’ paunches"
200,15,38,"down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set"
200,15,39,aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the
200,15,40,better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our
200,15,41,table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all.”
200,15,42,"The others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent, said,"
200,15,43,"“Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his"
200,15,44,"own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though"
200,15,45,"I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear,"
200,15,46,however that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour Irus and
200,15,47,secure him the victory.”
200,15,48,"They swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath"
200,15,49,"Telemachus put in a word and said, “Stranger, if you have a mind to"
200,15,50,"settle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here."
200,15,51,"Whoever strikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and"
200,15,52,"the other chiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of"
200,15,53,"understanding, are of the same mind as I am.”"
200,15,54,"Every one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,"
200,15,55,"thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his"
200,15,56,mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even
200,15,57,"stronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one"
200,15,58,"would turn towards his neighbour saying, “The stranger has brought such"
200,15,59,a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of
200,15,60,Irus.”
200,15,61,"Irus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded"
200,15,62,"him by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court] in such"
200,15,63,a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded him and
200,15,64,"said, “You swaggering bully, you ought never to have been born at all"
200,15,65,if you are afraid of such an old broken down creature as this tramp is.
200,15,66,"I say, therefore — and it shall surely be — if he beats you and proves"
200,15,67,"himself the better man, I shall pack you off on board ship to the"
200,15,68,"mainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes"
200,15,69,"near him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your"
200,15,70,entrails for the dogs to eat.”
200,15,71,"This frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the middle"
200,15,72,"of the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then Ulysses"
200,15,73,considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an end
200,15,74,"of him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter blow"
200,15,75,that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best to give
200,15,76,the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect who he
200,15,77,"was. Then they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the right"
200,15,78,shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the ear that
200,15,79,"broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came gushing out of his"
200,15,80,"mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking on"
200,15,81,"the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of"
200,15,82,"laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by the foot and dragged him"
200,15,83,into the outer court as far as the gate - house. There he propped him up
200,15,84,"against the wall and put his staff in his hands. “Sit here,” said he,"
200,15,85,"“and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful creature, and if you"
200,15,86,try to make yourself king of the beggars any more you shall fare still
200,15,87,worse.”
200,15,88,"Then he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn over his"
200,15,89,"shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down upon"
200,15,90,"the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and"
200,15,91,"saluting him, “May Jove, and all the other gods,” said they, “grant you"
200,15,92,whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of this
200,15,93,"insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently, to"
200,15,94,"king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him.”"
200,15,95,"Ulysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat’s"
200,15,96,paunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves
200,15,97,"out of the bread - basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he did"
200,15,98,"so in a golden goblet of wine. “Good luck to you,” he said, “father"
200,15,99,"stranger, you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have"
200,15,100,better times by and by.”
200,15,101,"To this Ulysses answered, “Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of good"
200,15,102,"understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are. I"
200,15,103,"have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man"
200,15,104,"both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you appear to"
200,15,105,"be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed to what I am"
200,15,106,saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon
200,15,107,"earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks"
200,15,108,"that he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even when the blessed gods"
200,15,109,"bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs must, and makes the best"
200,15,110,of it; for God almighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know
200,15,111,"all about it, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the"
200,15,112,"stubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and my"
200,15,113,brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in all things
200,15,114,"always, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him without"
200,15,115,vain glory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see
200,15,116,"how they are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour to the wife, of"
200,15,117,"one who is certain to return some day, and that, too, not long hence."
200,15,118,"Nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send you home quietly first that"
200,15,119,"you may not meet with him in the day of his coming, for once he is here"
200,15,120,the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly.”
200,15,121,"With these words he made a drink - offering, and when he had drunk he put"
200,15,122,"the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked away"
200,15,123,"serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he did"
200,15,124,"not escape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him to fall by the hand"
200,15,125,of Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from which he had
200,15,126,come.
200,15,127,Then Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the
200,15,128,"suitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and win"
200,15,129,still further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned a mocking
200,15,130,"laugh and said, “Eurynome, I have changed my mind, and have a fancy to"
200,15,131,show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should like also
200,15,132,to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything more to do
200,15,133,with them. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief.”
200,15,134,"“My dear child,” answered Eurynome, “all that you have said is true, go"
200,15,135,"and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint your"
200,15,136,face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is
200,15,137,"not right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus, whom"
200,15,138,"you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is already"
200,15,139,grown up.”
200,15,140,"“I know, Eurynome,” replied Penelope, “that you mean well, but do not"
200,15,141,"try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed me"
200,15,142,"of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell"
200,15,143,Autonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when I am
200,15,144,in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it would not be
200,15,145,proper for me to do so.”
200,15,146,On this the old woman150 went out of the room to bid the maids go to
200,15,147,their mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another
200,15,148,"matter, and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on"
200,15,149,her couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed
200,15,150,grace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her. She
200,15,151,washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears when she
200,15,152,goes dancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of a more
200,15,153,"commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter than sawn"
200,15,154,"ivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away, whereon the maids"
200,15,155,came in from the women’s room and woke Penelope with the sound of their
200,15,156,talking.
200,15,157,"“What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,” said she, as"
200,15,158,"she passed her hands over her face, “in spite of all my misery. I wish"
200,15,159,"Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment, that I might"
200,15,160,"no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband, who"
200,15,161,possessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished man
200,15,162,among the Achaeans.”
200,15,163,"With these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but"
200,15,164,"attended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she"
200,15,165,"stood by one of the bearing - posts supporting the roof of the cloister,"
200,15,166,"holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either"
200,15,167,side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and
200,15,168,"became so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might"
200,15,169,win her for his own bed fellow.
200,15,170,"“Telemachus,” said she, addressing her son, “I fear you are no longer"
200,15,171,so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger
200,15,172,"you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown"
200,15,173,"up, though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of a"
200,15,174,"well to do father as far as size and good looks go, your conduct is by"
200,15,175,no means what it should be. What is all this disturbance that has been
200,15,176,"going on, and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully"
200,15,177,ill - treated? What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury
200,15,178,while a suppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very
200,15,179,discreditable to you.”
200,15,180,"“I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,” replied"
200,15,181,"Telemachus, “I understand all about it and know when things are not as"
200,15,182,"they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,"
200,15,183,"however, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and then"
200,15,184,"another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind,"
200,15,185,"and I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight"
200,15,186,between Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it
200,15,187,"to do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,"
200,15,188,"Minerva, and Apollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers"
200,15,189,"of yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might all"
200,15,190,be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See
200,15,191,how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing
200,15,192,"that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home, wherever"
200,15,193,"that may be, for he has no strength left in him.”"
200,15,194,"Thus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, “Queen"
200,15,195,"Penelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos"
200,15,196,"could see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your"
200,15,197,"house by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the"
200,15,198,whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of
200,15,199,understanding.”
200,15,200,"To this Penelope replied, “Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my"
200,15,201,beauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and
200,15,202,my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my
200,15,203,"affairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presence to"
200,15,204,"the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions"
200,15,205,"which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all,"
200,15,206,"and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand — ‘Wife,’"
200,15,207,"he said, ‘we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the"
200,15,208,Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent also at
200,15,209,"fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner"
200,15,210,"than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to"
200,15,211,"you, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do"
200,15,212,you look after things here. Take care of my father and mother as at
200,15,213,"present, and even more so during my absence, but when you see our son"
200,15,214,"growing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave this your present"
200,15,215,home.’ This is what he said and now it is all coming true. A night will
200,15,216,"come when I shall have to yield myself to a marriage which I detest,"
200,15,217,"for Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief,"
200,15,218,"moreover, cuts me to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me"
200,15,219,after the custom of my country. When men are courting a woman who they
200,15,220,"think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and when"
200,15,221,"they are each trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen"
200,15,222,"and sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and they make her"
200,15,223,"magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people’s property"
200,15,224,without paying for it.”
200,15,225,"This was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying"
200,15,226,"to get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair words"
200,15,227,which he knew she did not mean.
200,15,228,"Then Antinous said, “Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many"
200,15,229,presents as you please from any one who will give them to you; it is
200,15,230,not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business nor
200,15,231,"stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among us"
200,15,232,whoever he may be.”
200,15,233,"The others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his"
200,15,234,servant to bring his present. Antinous’s man returned with a large and
200,15,235,lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully
200,15,236,made brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus
200,15,237,immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads
200,15,238,that gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas’s two men returned with some
200,15,239,earrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most
200,15,240,beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace of
200,15,241,"the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful"
200,15,242,present of some kind.
200,15,243,"Then the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought"
200,15,244,the presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and
200,15,245,"dancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it"
200,15,246,"grew dark; they then brought in three braziers151 to give light, and"
200,15,247,"piled them up with chopped firewood very old and dry, and they lit"
200,15,248,"torches from them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then"
200,15,249,Ulysses said:
200,15,250,"“Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the"
200,15,251,"queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick"
200,15,252,wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till
200,15,253,"morning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.”"
200,15,254,"The maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho"
200,15,255,"began to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but"
200,15,256,"had been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play"
200,15,257,"with, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all"
200,15,258,"this she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress, and"
200,15,259,"used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in love."
200,15,260,"“Poor wretch,” said she, “are you gone clean out of your mind? Go and"
200,15,261,"sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering"
200,15,262,here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters — so
200,15,263,"many of them too? Has the wine been getting into your head, or do you"
200,15,264,always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you
200,15,265,beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than he does not come
200,15,266,and cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the
200,15,267,house.”
200,15,268,"“Vixen,” replied Ulysses, scowling at her, “I will go and tell"
200,15,269,"Telemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb"
200,15,270,from limb.”
200,15,271,"With these words he scared the women, and they went off into the body"
200,15,272,"of the house. They trembled all over, for they thought he would do as"
200,15,273,"he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers, holding"
200,15,274,up torches and looking at the people — brooding the while on things that
200,15,275,should surely come to pass.
200,15,276,But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their
200,15,277,"insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against"
200,15,278,"them; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him,"
200,15,279,"which made the others laugh. “Listen to me,” said he, “you suitors of"
200,15,280,"Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for"
200,15,281,nothing that this man has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe the
200,15,282,"light has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head — for"
200,15,283,"his hair is all gone, every bit of it.”"
200,15,284,"Then turning to Ulysses he said, “Stranger, will you work as a servant,"
200,15,285,if I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you
200,15,286,"build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year"
200,15,287,"round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not"
200,15,288,"you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not want to work; you had"
200,15,289,rather fill your belly by going round the country begging.”
200,15,290,"“Eurymachus,” answered Ulysses, “if you and I were to work one against"
200,15,291,the other in early summer when the days are at their longest — give me a
200,15,292,"good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will last"
200,15,293,"the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing"
200,15,294,"grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us each take a"
200,15,295,"yoke of tawny oxen, well - mated and of great strength and endurance:"
200,15,296,"turn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or I can drive the"
200,15,297,"straighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out this day, give me a"
200,15,298,"shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my"
200,15,299,"temples — you would find me foremost in the fray, and would cease your"
200,15,300,"gibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel, and think yourself a"
200,15,301,"great man because you live in a little world, and that a bad one. If"
200,15,302,"Ulysses comes to his own again, the doors of his house are wide, but"
200,15,303,you will find them narrow when you try to fly through them.”
200,15,304,"Eurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, “You"
200,15,305,"wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me,"
200,15,306,and in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do you
200,15,307,always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you
200,15,308,"beat the tramp Irus.” With this he caught hold of a footstool, but"
200,15,309,"Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, for"
200,15,310,he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and
200,15,311,"knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and his"
200,15,312,wine - jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered
200,15,313,"cloister were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his"
200,15,314,"neighbour, saying, “I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad"
200,15,315,"luck to him, for all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such"
200,15,316,disturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail we
200,15,317,shall have no more pleasure at our banquet.”
200,15,318,"On this Telemachus came forward and said, “Sirs, are you mad? Can you"
200,15,319,not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has
200,15,320,"possessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you have had"
200,15,321,"your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.”"
200,15,322,The suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;
200,15,323,"but Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, “Do not"
200,15,324,"let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer."
200,15,325,Neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of Ulysses’
200,15,326,"servants. Let the cupbearer go round with the drink - offerings, that we"
200,15,327,"may make them and go home to our rest. As for the stranger, let us"
200,15,328,"leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to his house that he has"
200,15,329,come.”
200,15,330,"Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of"
200,15,331,"Dulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water"
200,15,332,"and handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they made their"
200,15,333,"drink - offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had made their"
200,15,334,"drink - offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded, they took"
200,15,335,their several ways each of them to his own abode.
200,16,1,TELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR — ULYSSES INTERVIEWS
200,16,2,PENELOPE — EURYCLEA WASHES HIS FEET AND RECOGNISES THE SCAR ON HIS
200,16,3,LEG — PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.
200,16,4,"Ulysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with"
200,16,5,Minerva’s help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said
200,16,6,"to Telemachus, “Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take it"
200,16,7,down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have
200,16,8,removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the
200,16,9,"smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away,"
200,16,10,but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more
200,16,11,particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over
200,16,12,"their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may"
200,16,13,"disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes"
200,16,14,tempts people to use them.”
200,16,15,"Telemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse"
200,16,16,"Euryclea and said, “Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I"
200,16,17,take the armour that my father left behind him down into the store
200,16,18,"room. No one looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got all"
200,16,19,smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down where
200,16,20,the smoke cannot reach it.”
200,16,21,"“I wish, child,” answered Euryclea, “that you would take the management"
200,16,22,"of the house into your own hands altogether, and look after all the"
200,16,23,property yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the
200,16,24,"store - room? The maids would have done so, but you would not let them.”"
200,16,25,"“The stranger,” said Telemachus, “shall show me a light; when people"
200,16,26,"eat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.”"
200,16,27,"Euryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room."
200,16,28,"Then Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields,"
200,16,29,and spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her
200,16,30,"hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said,"
200,16,31,"“Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters,"
200,16,32,"crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with a"
200,16,33,flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come down from
200,16,34,heaven.”
200,16,35,"“Hush,” answered Ulysses, “hold your peace and ask no questions, for"
200,16,36,"this is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here"
200,16,37,to talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will
200,16,38,ask me all sorts of questions.”
200,16,39,On this Telemachus went by torch - light to the other side of the inner
200,16,40,"court, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed"
200,16,41,"till morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering on the"
200,16,42,means whereby with Minerva’s help he might be able to kill the suitors.
200,16,43,"Then Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and"
200,16,44,they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the
200,16,45,fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a
200,16,46,footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered
200,16,47,"with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from the"
200,16,48,women’s room to join her. They set about removing the tables at which
200,16,49,"the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away the bread that was"
200,16,50,"left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied the embers"
200,16,51,"out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both light"
200,16,52,"and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said,"
200,16,53,"“Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all"
200,16,54,"night and spying upon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat"
200,16,55,"your supper there, or you shall be driven out with a firebrand.”"
200,16,56,"Ulysses scowled at her and answered, “My good woman, why should you be"
200,16,57,"so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all"
200,16,58,"in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner"
200,16,59,"of tramps and beggars generally? I too was a rich man once, and had a"
200,16,60,fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I
200,16,61,"now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number"
200,16,62,"of servants, and all the other things which people have who live well"
200,16,63,"and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from"
200,16,64,"me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that pride and"
200,16,65,place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you
200,16,66,"get out of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come"
200,16,67,"home, for there is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though"
200,16,68,"he be dead as you think he is, yet by Apollo’s will he has left a son"
200,16,69,"behind him, Telemachus, who will note anything done amiss by the maids"
200,16,70,"in the house, for he is now no longer in his boyhood.”"
200,16,71,"Penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, “Impudent"
200,16,72,"baggage,” said she, “I see how abominably you are behaving, and you"
200,16,73,"shall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself,"
200,16,74,"that I was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for"
200,16,75,whose sake I am in such continual sorrow.”
200,16,76,"Then she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, “Bring a seat with a"
200,16,77,"fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story,"
200,16,78,and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.”
200,16,79,"Eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon"
200,16,80,"as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, “Stranger, I shall"
200,16,81,first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and
200,16,82,parents.”
200,16,83,"“Madam,” answered Ulysses, “who on the face of the whole earth can dare"
200,16,84,to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself;
200,16,85,"you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the"
200,16,86,monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and
200,16,87,"barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs,"
200,16,88,"and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people"
200,16,89,"do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask"
200,16,90,"me some other question and do not seek to know my race and family, or"
200,16,91,you will recall memories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am
200,16,92,"full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit weeping and wailing in"
200,16,93,"another person’s house, nor is it well to be thus grieving continually."
200,16,94,"I shall have one of the servants or even yourself complaining of me,"
200,16,95,and saying that my eyes swim with tears because I am heavy with wine.”
200,16,96,"Then Penelope answered, “Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,"
200,16,97,"whether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my"
200,16,98,dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs
200,16,99,I should be both more respected and should show a better presence to
200,16,100,"the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions"
200,16,101,which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our
200,16,102,"islands — Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself, are"
200,16,103,wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore
200,16,104,"show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say"
200,16,105,"that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time broken - hearted"
200,16,106,"about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to"
200,16,107,invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven
200,16,108,"put it in my mind to set up a great tambour - frame in my room, and to"
200,16,109,begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to
200,16,110,"them, ‘Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to"
200,16,111,marry again immediately; wait — for I would not have my skill in
200,16,112,needlework perish unrecorded — till I have finished making a pall for the
200,16,113,"hero Laertes, to be ready against the time when death shall take him."
200,16,114,"He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out"
200,16,115,"without a pall.’ This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I"
200,16,116,"used to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would"
200,16,117,unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for
200,16,118,"three years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was"
200,16,119,"now in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been"
200,16,120,"accomplished, those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to"
200,16,121,"the suitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry"
200,16,122,"with me, so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And"
200,16,123,now I do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of
200,16,124,"this marriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my"
200,16,125,"son chafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for"
200,16,126,he is now old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able
200,16,127,"to look after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an"
200,16,128,"excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you"
200,16,129,are and where you come from — for you must have had father and mother of
200,16,130,some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.”
200,16,131,"Then Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in"
200,16,132,"asking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me:"
200,16,133,people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as I
200,16,134,"have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as"
200,16,135,regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and
200,16,136,fruitful island in mid - ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and
200,16,137,there are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different
200,16,138,"languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave"
200,16,139,"Eteocretans, Dorians of three - fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a"
200,16,140,"great town there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had"
200,16,141,"a conference with Jove himself.152 Minos was father to Deucalion, whose"
200,16,142,"son I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus"
200,16,143,"sailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my"
200,16,144,"brother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the"
200,16,145,two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him
200,16,146,"hospitality, for the winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy,"
200,16,147,carrying him out of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in
200,16,148,"Amnisus off the cave of Ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to"
200,16,149,enter and he could hardly find shelter from the winds that were then
200,16,150,raging. As soon as he got there he went into the town and asked for
200,16,151,"Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had"
200,16,152,"already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, so I took"
200,16,153,"him to my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had"
200,16,154,"abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with"
200,16,155,"barley meal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and"
200,16,156,oxen for them to sacrifice to their heart’s content. They stayed with
200,16,157,"me twelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the North so strong"
200,16,158,that one could hardly keep one’s feet on land. I suppose some
200,16,159,"unfriendly god had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the"
200,16,160,"wind dropped, and they got away.”"
200,16,161,"Many a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept"
200,16,162,"as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the"
200,16,163,mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed
200,16,164,"upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so"
200,16,165,did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time
200,16,166,"sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was sorry for her, but he"
200,16,167,kept his eyes as hard as horn or iron without letting them so much as
200,16,168,"quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had"
200,16,169,"relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said: “Now,"
200,16,170,"stranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no you really"
200,16,171,"did entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me,"
200,16,172,"then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look at, and so"
200,16,173,also with his companions.”
200,16,174,"“Madam,” answered Ulysses, “it is such a long time ago that I can"
200,16,175,"hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and"
200,16,176,went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect.
200,16,177,"Ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened"
200,16,178,by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this
200,16,179,there was a device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his
200,16,180,"fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one"
200,16,181,"marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in gold, the"
200,16,182,"dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was"
200,16,183,struggling convulsively to escape.153 As for the shirt that he wore
200,16,184,"next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an"
200,16,185,"onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women"
200,16,186,"who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that"
200,16,187,"I do not know whether Ulysses wore these clothes when he left home, or"
200,16,188,whether one of his companions had given them to him while he was on his
200,16,189,voyage; or possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a
200,16,190,"present of them, for he was a man of many friends and had few equals"
200,16,191,among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful
200,16,192,"purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet,"
200,16,193,and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a
200,16,194,"servant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what"
200,16,195,"he was like; his shoulders were hunched,154 he was dark, and he had"
200,16,196,"thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with"
200,16,197,"greater familiarity than he did any of the others, as being the most"
200,16,198,like - minded with himself.”
200,16,199,Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable
200,16,200,proofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found
200,16,201,"relief in tears she said to him, “Stranger, I was already disposed to"
200,16,202,"pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my"
200,16,203,house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them
200,16,204,"out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also"
200,16,205,the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him
200,16,206,home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that
200,16,207,detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.”
200,16,208,"Then Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure"
200,16,209,"yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can"
200,16,210,hardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and
200,16,211,"borne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even"
200,16,212,"though he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god."
200,16,213,"Still, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell you. I will hide"
200,16,214,"nothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately"
200,16,215,heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the
200,16,216,"Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has"
200,16,217,begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were
200,16,218,"lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the"
200,16,219,sun - god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the
200,16,220,"sun - god’s cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck"
200,16,221,to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the
200,16,222,"Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him"
200,16,223,"as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to"
200,16,224,escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here
200,16,225,"long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering"
200,16,226,wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no
200,16,227,one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all
200,16,228,"this, and he swore to me — making drink - offerings in his house as he did"
200,16,229,so — that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would
200,16,230,"take Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there"
200,16,231,happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat - growing island
200,16,232,"of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got"
200,16,233,"together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep"
200,16,234,his family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to
200,16,235,"Dodona that he might learn Jove’s mind from the high oak tree, and know"
200,16,236,whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or
200,16,237,in secret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is
200,16,238,close at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer;
200,16,239,"nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is"
200,16,240,"the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of"
200,16,241,"Ulysses to which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely"
200,16,242,come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end
200,16,243,of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.”
200,16,244,"“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true you"
200,16,245,shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you
200,16,246,shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses
200,16,247,"will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely"
200,16,248,"as that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such masters in"
200,16,249,"the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further them"
200,16,250,"on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make"
200,16,251,"him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and"
200,16,252,"quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again,"
200,16,253,that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It
200,16,254,shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil
200,16,255,"to him; like it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For"
200,16,256,"how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to"
200,16,257,"others of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let"
200,16,258,you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for a
200,16,259,"little season; if they are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them ill"
200,16,260,"so long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously of them when they"
200,16,261,"are dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously, the people"
200,16,262,"tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call him blessed.”"
200,16,263,"Ulysses answered, “Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the"
200,16,264,day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will
200,16,265,lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after
200,16,266,"night have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for"
200,16,267,"morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let"
200,16,268,"any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you"
200,16,269,have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as much trouble
200,16,270,"as I have, I will allow her to wash them.”"
200,16,271,"To this Penelope said, “My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet"
200,16,272,came to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with such
200,16,273,admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house a most
200,16,274,respectable old woman — the same who received my poor dear husband in her
200,16,275,"arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She is very"
200,16,276,"feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.” “Come here,” said she,"
200,16,277,"“Euryclea, and wash your master’s age - mate; I suppose Ulysses’ hands"
200,16,278,"and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of"
200,16,279,us dreadfully fast.”
200,16,280,On these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began
200,16,281,"to weep and made lamentation saying, “My dear child, I cannot think"
200,16,282,whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more
200,16,283,"god - fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole"
200,16,284,"world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs"
200,16,285,when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your
200,16,286,son grow up to take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone
200,16,287,from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the women in
200,16,288,some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as all
200,16,289,these sluts here have been gibing at you. I do not wonder at your not
200,16,290,choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have
200,16,291,"insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope"
200,16,292,has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for Penelope’s sake
200,16,293,"and for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of"
200,16,294,"compassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which pray attend"
200,16,295,to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before
200,16,296,"now, but I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like"
200,16,297,"Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as you are.”"
200,16,298,"“Those who have seen us both,” answered Ulysses, “have always said we"
200,16,299,"were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.”"
200,16,300,Then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his
200,16,301,"feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till the bath"
200,16,302,"was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away"
200,16,303,"from the light, for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold"
200,16,304,"of his leg she would recognise a certain scar which it bore, whereon"
200,16,305,the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing
200,16,306,"her master, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by"
200,16,307,a wild boar when he was hunting on Mt. Parnassus with his excellent
200,16,308,grandfather Autolycus — who was the most accomplished thief and perjurer
200,16,309,in the whole world — and with the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had
200,16,310,"endowed him with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh bones of"
200,16,311,"goats and kids to him, so he took pleasure in his companionship. It"
200,16,312,happened once that Autolycus had gone to Ithaca and had found the child
200,16,313,of his daughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set
200,16,314,"the infant upon his knees and said, “Autolycus, you must find a name"
200,16,315,for your grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.”
200,16,316,"“Son - in - law and daughter,” replied Autolycus, “call the child thus: I"
200,16,317,am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and
200,16,318,"another, both men and women; so name the child ‘Ulysses,’ or the child"
200,16,319,of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother’s family on
200,16,320,"Mt. Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and"
200,16,321,will send him on his way rejoicing.”
200,16,322,"Ulysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from"
200,16,323,"Autolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome."
200,16,324,"His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his"
200,16,325,"head, and both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to"
200,16,326,"get dinner ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five"
200,16,327,"year old bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints;"
200,16,328,these they then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them;
200,16,329,they roasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus
200,16,330,"through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and"
200,16,331,every man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the
200,16,332,"sun set and it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of"
200,16,333,sleep.
200,16,334,"When the child of morning, rosy - fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of"
200,16,335,"Autolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too."
200,16,336,They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy
200,16,337,"upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields,"
200,16,338,"fresh - risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came to a"
200,16,339,mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the
200,16,340,"beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolycus,"
200,16,341,"among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear"
200,16,342,in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick
200,16,343,"brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it,"
200,16,344,"nor could the sun’s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick"
200,16,345,"with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men’s feet, and the"
200,16,346,"hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him, so he"
200,16,347,"rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay"
200,16,348,with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first to raise his
200,16,349,"spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick"
200,16,350,"for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a"
200,16,351,"gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar,"
200,16,352,"Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went"
200,16,353,"right through him, so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life"
200,16,354,went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the
200,16,355,"carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses’ wound; then, after saying a"
200,16,356,"spell to stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But"
200,16,357,"when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made"
200,16,358,"him some splendid presents, and sent him back to Ithaca with much"
200,16,359,"mutual good will. When he got back, his father and mother were rejoiced"
200,16,360,"to see him, and asked him all about it, and how he had hurt himself to"
200,16,361,get the scar; so he told them how the boar had ripped him when he was
200,16,362,out hunting with Autolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.
200,16,363,As soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well
200,16,364,"hold of it, she recognised it and dropped the foot at once. The leg"
200,16,365,"fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all the"
200,16,366,water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea’s eyes between her joy and her
200,16,367,"grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught"
200,16,368,"Ulysses by the beard and said, “My dear child, I am sure you must be"
200,16,369,"Ulysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched"
200,16,370,and handled you.”
200,16,371,"As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her"
200,16,372,"that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable to look"
200,16,373,"in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had"
200,16,374,diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with
200,16,375,"his right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said,"
200,16,376,"“Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own"
200,16,377,"breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to"
200,16,378,my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to
200,16,379,"recognise me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about it to any"
200,16,380,"one else in the house, for if you do I tell you — and it shall surely"
200,16,381,"be — that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will"
200,16,382,"not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other"
200,16,383,women.”
200,16,384,"“My child,” answered Euryclea, “what are you talking about? You know"
200,16,385,very well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my
200,16,386,"tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay"
200,16,387,"my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into"
200,16,388,"your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who have"
200,16,389,"been ill - behaved, and of those who are guiltless.”"
200,16,390,"And Ulysses answered, “Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am"
200,16,391,well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your
200,16,392,tongue and leave everything to heaven.”
200,16,393,"As he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,"
200,16,394,for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and
200,16,395,"anointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm"
200,16,396,"himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking"
200,16,397,to him and said:
200,16,398,"“Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another"
200,16,399,"matter. It is indeed nearly bed time — for those, at least, who can sleep"
200,16,400,"in spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such"
200,16,401,"unmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties and"
200,16,402,"looking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the"
200,16,403,"whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie"
200,16,404,"awake thinking, and my heart becomes a prey to the most incessant and"
200,16,405,"cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in"
200,16,406,"the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many a"
200,16,407,plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own
200,16,408,"child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in"
200,16,409,"its uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard"
200,16,410,"my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard"
200,16,411,"to public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is"
200,16,412,not now time for me to go with the best of these suitors who are wooing
200,16,413,me and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still
200,16,414,"young, and unable to understand, he would not hear of my leaving my"
200,16,415,"husband’s house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to"
200,16,416,"do so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his"
200,16,417,"property. Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for"
200,16,418,me if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of
200,16,419,"a trough,155 and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great"
200,16,420,"eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into"
200,16,421,the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he
200,16,422,"soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;"
200,16,423,"whereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so"
200,16,424,piteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he
200,16,425,"came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with"
200,16,426,"human voice, and told me to leave off crying. ‘Be of good courage,’ he"
200,16,427,"said, ‘daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen"
200,16,428,"that shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no"
200,16,429,"longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who"
200,16,430,"will bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.’ On this I woke, and"
200,16,431,when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as
200,16,432,usual.”
200,16,433,"“This dream, Madam,” replied Ulysses, “can admit but of one"
200,16,434,"interpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be"
200,16,435,"fulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single"
200,16,436,one of them will escape.”
200,16,437,"And Penelope answered, “Stranger, dreams are very curious and"
200,16,438,"unaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably come"
200,16,439,true. There are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies
200,16,440,"proceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come"
200,16,441,"through the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn"
200,16,442,"mean something to those that see them. I do not think, however, that my"
200,16,443,"own dream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be"
200,16,444,most thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say — and lay
200,16,445,my saying to your heart — the coming dawn will usher in the ill - omened
200,16,446,"day that is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about to"
200,16,447,hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the
200,16,448,"court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon which a ship is"
200,16,449,built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the
200,16,450,"whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same thing, and"
200,16,451,"whichever of them can string the bow most easily, and send his arrow"
200,16,452,"through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of"
200,16,453,"my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so, I"
200,16,454,doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.”
200,16,455,"Then Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, you need not defer your"
200,16,456,"tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow,"
200,16,457,"handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron.”"
200,16,458,"To this Penelope said, “As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk to"
200,16,459,"me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do"
200,16,460,"permanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on"
200,16,461,earth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline
200,16,462,upon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from
200,16,463,the day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.”
200,16,464,"She then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by her"
200,16,465,"maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva"
200,16,466,shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.
200,17,1,ULYSSES CANNOT SLEEP — PENELOPE’S PRAYER TO DIANA — THE TWO SIGNS FROM

200,17,3,AN OX’S FOOT AT ULYSSES — THEOCLYMENUS FORETELLS DISASTER AND LEAVES THE
200,17,4,HOUSE.
200,17,5,"Ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock’s hide, on the"
200,17,6,"top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten,"
200,17,7,and Eurynome156 threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down.
200,17,8,"There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he"
200,17,9,"should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had been in the"
200,17,10,"habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the house giggling"
200,17,11,"and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very angry, and he"
200,17,12,doubted whether to get up and kill every single one of them then and
200,17,13,"there, or to let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors."
200,17,14,"His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and"
200,17,15,"shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did his heart growl with"
200,17,16,anger at the evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast
200,17,17,"and said, “Heart, be still, you had worse than this to bear on the day"
200,17,18,when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in
200,17,19,"silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made"
200,17,20,sure of being killed.”
200,17,21,"Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he"
200,17,22,tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front
200,17,23,"of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that"
200,17,24,"he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn himself"
200,17,25,"about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single handed as he"
200,17,26,"was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked"
200,17,27,suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of
200,17,28,"a woman, and hovered over his head saying, “My poor unhappy man, why do"
200,17,29,you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside
200,17,30,"it, and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father may"
200,17,31,be proud of.”
200,17,32,"“Goddess,” answered Ulysses, “all that you have said is true, but I am"
200,17,33,in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors
200,17,34,"single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are. And there"
200,17,35,"is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing"
200,17,36,"that with Jove’s and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must"
200,17,37,ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it
200,17,38,is all over.”
200,17,39,"“For shame,” replied Minerva, “why, any one else would trust a worse"
200,17,40,"ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less"
200,17,41,"wise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you"
200,17,42,throughout in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though
200,17,43,"there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you"
200,17,44,"should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you."
200,17,45,"But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and you"
200,17,46,shall be out of your troubles before long.”
200,17,47,"As she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to"
200,17,48,Olympus.
200,17,49,While Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that
200,17,50,"eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting"
200,17,51,up in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping
200,17,52,"she prayed to Diana saying, “Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove,"
200,17,53,drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch
200,17,54,me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the
200,17,55,"mouths of over - flowing Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus."
200,17,56,"The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods"
200,17,57,"killed them, so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them,"
200,17,58,"and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them to"
200,17,59,excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an
200,17,60,"imposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of"
200,17,61,accomplishment; but one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see
200,17,62,Jove about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall
200,17,63,happen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came and
200,17,64,spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I
200,17,65,"wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight,"
200,17,66,"or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain go even beneath"
200,17,67,"the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only, and"
200,17,68,"without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no"
200,17,69,"matter how much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so"
200,17,70,"long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in"
200,17,71,slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me
200,17,72,even in my dreams. This very night methought there was one lying by my
200,17,73,"side who was like Ulysses as he was when he went away with his host,"
200,17,74,"and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream, but the very truth"
200,17,75,itself.”
200,17,76,"On this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and"
200,17,77,"it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by"
200,17,78,his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had
200,17,79,"lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock’s"
200,17,80,"hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed,"
200,17,81,"saying “Father Jove, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and"
200,17,82,"sea to my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me,"
200,17,83,give me a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are
200,17,84,"now waking within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind"
200,17,85,from outside.”
200,17,86,Thus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up
200,17,87,"among the clouds from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad"
200,17,88,"when he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller - woman"
200,17,89,from hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another
200,17,90,sign. There were twelve miller - women whose business it was to grind
200,17,91,wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground
200,17,92,"their task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet"
200,17,93,"finished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard"
200,17,94,the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.
200,17,95,"“Father Jove,” said she, “you, who rule over heaven and earth, you have"
200,17,96,"thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this"
200,17,97,"means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of me your poor"
200,17,98,"servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the"
200,17,99,suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour
200,17,100,"of grinding meal for them, and I hope they may never have another"
200,17,101,dinner anywhere at all.”
200,17,102,Ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman’s
200,17,103,"speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should"
200,17,104,avenge himself on the suitors.
200,17,105,Then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;
200,17,106,Telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about
200,17,107,"his shoulder, bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and took a"
200,17,108,doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the
200,17,109,"threshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea, “Nurse, did you make"
200,17,110,"the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let"
200,17,111,"him shift for himself? — for my mother, good woman though she is, has a"
200,17,112,"way of paying great attention to second - rate people, and of neglecting"
200,17,113,others who are in reality much better men.”
200,17,114,"“Do not find fault child,” said Euryclea, “when there is no one to find"
200,17,115,fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked:
200,17,116,your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he
200,17,117,would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants to make
200,17,118,"one for him, but he said he was such a wretched outcast that he would"
200,17,119,not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having an
200,17,120,undressed bullock’s hide and some sheepskins put for him in the
200,17,121,cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.”157
200,17,122,Then Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans
200,17,123,"were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not"
200,17,124,"alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids"
200,17,125,"and said, “Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and"
200,17,126,sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the
200,17,127,"seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out"
200,17,128,"the mixing - jugs and the cups, and go for water from the fountain at"
200,17,129,"once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early, for"
200,17,130,it is a feast day.”
200,17,131,"Thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them"
200,17,132,"went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to"
200,17,133,work about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors
200,17,134,also came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned
200,17,135,"from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three"
200,17,136,"best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises, and"
200,17,137,"then he said good - humouredly to Ulysses, “Stranger, are the suitors"
200,17,138,"treating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?”"
200,17,139,"“May heaven,” answered Ulysses, “requite to them the wickedness with"
200,17,140,which they deal high - handedly in another man’s house without any sense
200,17,141,of shame.”
200,17,142,"Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for"
200,17,143,he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors’ dinner; and he
200,17,144,"had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse,"
200,17,145,"and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. “Are you still here,"
200,17,146,"stranger,” said he, “to pester people by begging about the house? Why"
200,17,147,can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding
200,17,148,before we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without
200,17,149,any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the
200,17,150,"Achaeans, as well as here?”"
200,17,151,"Ulysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third"
200,17,152,"man, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and"
200,17,153,some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there to
200,17,154,take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made his
200,17,155,"heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to"
200,17,156,"the swineherd. “Who, Swineherd,” said he, “is this stranger that is"
200,17,157,lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where does
200,17,158,"he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man,"
200,17,159,but the gods give sorrow to whom they will — even to kings if it so
200,17,160,pleases them.”
200,17,161,As he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;
200,17,162,"“Good day to you, father stranger,” said he, “you seem to be very"
200,17,163,"poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father"
200,17,164,"Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children,"
200,17,165,yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat
200,17,166,"came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for he"
200,17,167,"reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about in just such rags as"
200,17,168,"this man’s are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is"
200,17,169,"already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,"
200,17,170,who made me his stockman when I was quite young among the
200,17,171,"Cephallenians, and now his cattle are countless; no one could have done"
200,17,172,"better with them than I have, for they have bred like ears of corn;"
200,17,173,"nevertheless I have to keep bringing them in for others to eat, who"
200,17,174,"take no heed to his son though he is in the house, and fear not the"
200,17,175,"wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide Ulysses’ property"
200,17,176,among them because he has been away so long. I have often thought — only
200,17,177,it would not be right while his son is living — of going off with the
200,17,178,"cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still"
200,17,179,harder to stay here and be ill - treated about other people’s herds. My
200,17,180,"position is intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put"
200,17,181,"myself under the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my"
200,17,182,"poor master will yet return, and send all these suitors flying out of"
200,17,183,the house.”
200,17,184,"“Stockman,” answered Ulysses, “you seem to be a very well - disposed"
200,17,185,"person, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will"
200,17,186,"tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath. By Jove, the chief of"
200,17,187,"all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses"
200,17,188,"shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so minded you"
200,17,189,shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.”
200,17,190,"“If Jove were to bring this to pass,” replied the stockman, “you should"
200,17,191,see how I would do my very utmost to help him.”
200,17,192,And in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.
200,17,193,Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to
200,17,194,murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand — an
200,17,195,"eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, “My friends,"
200,17,196,this plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to
200,17,197,dinner instead.”
200,17,198,"The others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the"
200,17,199,"benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the"
200,17,200,"heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round."
200,17,201,"They mixed the wine in the mixing - bowls, and the swineherd gave every"
200,17,202,"man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in the bread"
200,17,203,"baskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then they laid"
200,17,204,their hands upon the good things that were before them.
200,17,205,Telemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that
200,17,206,was paved with stone;158 he gave him a shabby looking seat at a little
200,17,207,"table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought to"
200,17,208,"him, with his wine in a gold cup. “Sit there,” said he, “and drink your"
200,17,209,wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and blows
200,17,210,"of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Ulysses,"
200,17,211,"and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and"
200,17,212,"your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief.”"
200,17,213,"The suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his"
200,17,214,"speech; then Antinous said, “We do not like such language but we will"
200,17,215,"put up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If"
200,17,216,Jove had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.”
200,17,217,"Thus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the"
200,17,218,"heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the"
200,17,219,Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.
200,17,220,"Then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man"
200,17,221,"his portion, and feasted to their heart’s content; those who waited at"
200,17,222,"table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for"
200,17,223,Telemachus had told them to do so.
200,17,224,But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their
200,17,225,"insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against"
200,17,226,"them. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name"
200,17,227,"was Ctesippus, and who came from Same. This man, confident in his great"
200,17,228,"wealth, was paying court to the wife of Ulysses, and said to the"
200,17,229,"suitors, “Hear what I have to say. The stranger has already had as"
200,17,230,"large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor"
200,17,231,"reasonable to ill - treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I will,"
200,17,232,"however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have"
200,17,233,"something to give to the bath - woman, or to some other of Ulysses’"
200,17,234,servants.”
200,17,235,As he spoke he picked up a heifer’s foot from the meat - basket in which
200,17,236,"it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little"
200,17,237,"aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion159 as he did"
200,17,238,"so, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to"
200,17,239,"Ctesippus, “It is a good thing for you,” said he, “that the stranger"
200,17,240,turned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should
200,17,241,"have run you through with my spear, and your father would have had to"
200,17,242,see about getting you buried rather than married in this house. So let
200,17,243,"me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am grown up"
200,17,244,"now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,"
200,17,245,instead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long
200,17,246,seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have
200,17,247,"put up with this, for one man is no match for many, but do me no"
200,17,248,"further violence. Still, if you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far"
200,17,249,rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after day — guests
200,17,250,"insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an"
200,17,251,unseemly way.”
200,17,252,"They all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,"
200,17,253,"“No one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it,"
200,17,254,"for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill - treating the"
200,17,255,"stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house; I"
200,17,256,"would say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother, which"
200,17,257,"I trust may commend itself to both. ‘As long,’ I would say, ‘as you had"
200,17,258,"ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home, no one could"
200,17,259,complain of your waiting and suffering160 the suitors to be in your
200,17,260,"house. It would have been better that he should have returned, but it"
200,17,261,is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all
200,17,262,"this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man,"
200,17,263,and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will
200,17,264,"yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink"
200,17,265,"in peace, while your mother will look after some other man’s house, not"
200,17,266,yours.’”
200,17,267,"To this Telemachus answered, “By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of"
200,17,268,"my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is"
200,17,269,"wandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my"
200,17,270,mother’s marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she
200,17,271,"will, and I will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare"
200,17,272,not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against her own
200,17,273,wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do this.”
200,17,274,"Minerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set"
200,17,275,their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.
200,17,276,"Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and"
200,17,277,their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and
200,17,278,"said, “Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud of"
200,17,279,"darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet with"
200,17,280,tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof - beams
200,17,281,drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are
200,17,282,full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted
200,17,283,"out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.”"
200,17,284,"Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus"
200,17,285,"then said, “This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses."
200,17,286,"Servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark"
200,17,287,here.”
200,17,288,"But Theoclymenus said, “Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me."
200,17,289,"I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an"
200,17,290,"understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for I"
200,17,291,"see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who are"
200,17,292,insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be
200,17,293,able to escape.”
200,17,294,"He left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him"
200,17,295,"welcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking"
200,17,296,Telemachus by laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to
200,17,297,"him, “Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have this"
200,17,298,"importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no skill"
200,17,299,"for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here"
200,17,300,is another fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet. Let me
200,17,301,"persuade you, for it will be much better to put them on board ship and"
200,17,302,send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.”
200,17,303,"Telemachus gave him no heed, but sate silently watching his father,"
200,17,304,expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.
200,17,305,"Meanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat"
200,17,306,"placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear"
200,17,307,what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid
200,17,308,"much merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had"
200,17,309,"sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come, and nothing"
200,17,310,can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a
200,17,311,brave man were soon to lay before them — for they had brought their doom
200,17,312,upon themselves.
200,18,1,"THE TRIAL OF THE AXES, DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO EUMAEUS"
200,18,2,AND PHILOETIUS
200,18,3,Minerva now put it in Penelope’s mind to make the suitors try their
200,18,4,"skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,"
200,18,5,as a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and
200,18,6,"got the store - room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of"
200,18,7,ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store - room at the end of
200,18,8,"the house, where her husband’s treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought"
200,18,9,"iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver full of"
200,18,10,deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in
200,18,11,Lacedaemon — Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with one another
200,18,12,"in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in"
200,18,13,order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the
200,18,14,"Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had"
200,18,15,sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these
200,18,16,"Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and"
200,18,17,the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had
200,18,18,gone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had
200,18,19,"lost, and the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were"
200,18,20,"the death of him in the end, for when he went to the house of Jove’s"
200,18,21,"son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules"
200,18,22,"to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not"
200,18,23,"heaven’s vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set"
200,18,24,"before Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the"
200,18,25,"mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and"
200,18,26,"gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which"
200,18,27,on his death had been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in
200,18,28,"return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast"
200,18,29,"friendship, although they never visited at one another’s houses, for"
200,18,30,"Jove’s son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow,"
200,18,31,"then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when"
200,18,32,"he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but"
200,18,33,had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.
200,18,34,Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store - room; the
200,18,35,"carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get"
200,18,36,it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the
200,18,37,"doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the"
200,18,38,"key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the"
200,18,39,doors;161 these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a
200,18,40,"meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests"
200,18,41,stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with
200,18,42,"fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow"
200,18,43,"case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees,"
200,18,44,"weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her"
200,18,45,"tears had relieved her, she went to the cloister where the suitors"
200,18,46,"were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly arrows that"
200,18,47,"were inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing a chest that"
200,18,48,contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as prizes.
200,18,49,"When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the bearing - posts"
200,18,50,"supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before her face,"
200,18,51,and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:
200,18,52,"“Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of"
200,18,53,"this house because its owner has been long absent, and without other"
200,18,54,"pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize"
200,18,55,"that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of"
200,18,56,"Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his"
200,18,57,"arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this"
200,18,58,"house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But"
200,18,59,even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.”
200,18,60,"As she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron"
200,18,61,"before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had"
200,18,62,"bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master’s"
200,18,63,"bow, but Antinous scolded them. “You country louts,” said he, “silly"
200,18,64,simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by
200,18,65,crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her
200,18,66,"husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go"
200,18,67,"outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors"
200,18,68,"shall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it"
200,18,69,no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of
200,18,70,us all who is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember
200,18,71,"him, though I was then only a child.”"
200,18,72,"This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to"
200,18,73,"string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be"
200,18,74,"the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses,"
200,18,75,whom he was dishonouring in his own house — egging the others on to do so
200,18,76,also.
200,18,77,"Then Telemachus spoke. “Great heavens!” he exclaimed, “Jove must have"
200,18,78,robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she
200,18,79,"will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying"
200,18,80,"myself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the"
200,18,81,"contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman"
200,18,82,"whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in"
200,18,83,Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need
200,18,84,"have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses"
200,18,85,"for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too"
200,18,86,"will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the"
200,18,87,"iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger,"
200,18,88,not if I can win the prizes which my father won before me.”
200,18,89,"As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him,"
200,18,90,"and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row,"
200,18,91,"in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by"
200,18,92,"line.162 Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was"
200,18,93,"surprised when they saw him set them up so orderly, though he had never"
200,18,94,"seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement"
200,18,95,"to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his"
200,18,96,"might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had"
200,18,97,hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for
200,18,98,"the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign"
200,18,99,to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:
200,18,100,"“Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too"
200,18,101,"young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to"
200,18,102,"hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are"
200,18,103,"stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.”"
200,18,104,"On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led"
200,18,105,into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow.
200,18,106,"Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous"
200,18,107,said:
200,18,108,"“Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the"
200,18,109,place at which the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.”
200,18,110,"The rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He"
200,18,111,"was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the"
200,18,112,mixing - bowl. 163 He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and was
200,18,113,indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow and
200,18,114,"arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could"
200,18,115,"not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work,"
200,18,116,"they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, “My"
200,18,117,"friends, I cannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take"
200,18,118,"the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die"
200,18,119,than to live after having missed the prize that we have so long striven
200,18,120,"for, and which has brought us so long together. Some one of us is even"
200,18,121,"now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen"
200,18,122,"this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some"
200,18,123,"other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer"
200,18,124,and whose lot it is to win her.”
200,18,125,"On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,164 with"
200,18,126,the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat
200,18,127,again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him
200,18,128,saying:
200,18,129,"“Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and"
200,18,130,"intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow"
200,18,131,"take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend"
200,18,132,"it yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are"
200,18,133,others who will soon string it.”
200,18,134,"Then he said to Melanthius the goatherd, “Look sharp, light a fire in"
200,18,135,"the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us"
200,18,136,"also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us"
200,18,137,"warm the bow and grease it — we will then make trial of it again, and"
200,18,138,bring the contest to an end.”
200,18,139,"Melanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside"
200,18,140,it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the
200,18,141,"house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but"
200,18,142,they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless
200,18,143,"there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders"
200,18,144,among the suitors and much the foremost among them all.
200,18,145,"Then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and"
200,18,146,Ulysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the
200,18,147,"outer yard, Ulysses said to them quietly:"
200,18,148,"“Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in"
200,18,149,doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of
200,18,150,"men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back"
200,18,151,here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do — to side with the
200,18,152,"suitors, or with Ulysses?”"
200,18,153,"“Father Jove,” answered the stockman, “would indeed that you might so"
200,18,154,"ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see"
200,18,155,with what might and main I would fight for him.”
200,18,156,In like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return;
200,18,157,"when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses"
200,18,158,"said, “It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at"
200,18,159,"last, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find"
200,18,160,"that you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for"
200,18,161,"I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two,"
200,18,162,"therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall"
200,18,163,"deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you,"
200,18,164,"will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me"
200,18,165,as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give
200,18,166,"you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is"
200,18,167,the scar from the boar’s tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on
200,18,168,Mt. Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.”
200,18,169,"As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they"
200,18,170,"had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw"
200,18,171,"their arms round him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses"
200,18,172,kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down
200,18,173,upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:
200,18,174,"“Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and"
200,18,175,"tell those who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both"
200,18,176,"together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; let this"
200,18,177,moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to
200,18,178,"prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you, therefore,"
200,18,179,"Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and tell"
200,18,180,the women to close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any
200,18,181,"groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not"
200,18,182,"come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work."
200,18,183,"And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer"
200,18,184,"court, and to bind them securely at once.”"
200,18,185,"When he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat"
200,18,186,"that he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside."
200,18,187,"At this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming"
200,18,188,"it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly"
200,18,189,"grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, “I grieve for myself and for"
200,18,190,"us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not"
200,18,191,"care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women in"
200,18,192,Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so
200,18,193,inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This
200,18,194,will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.”
200,18,195,"“It shall not be so, Eurymachus,” said Antinous, “and you know it"
200,18,196,yourself. Today is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can
200,18,197,string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side — as for the axes
200,18,198,"they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the house"
200,18,199,"and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that we"
200,18,200,may make our drink - offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will
200,18,201,tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats tomorrow — the best he has; we
200,18,202,"can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make"
200,18,203,"trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.”"
200,18,204,"The rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over"
200,18,205,"the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing - bowls with wine"
200,18,206,and water and handed it round after giving every man his
200,18,207,"drink - offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk"
200,18,208,"each as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said: —"
200,18,209,"“Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am"
200,18,210,"minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who has"
200,18,211,just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and
200,18,212,"leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give"
200,18,213,"victory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that"
200,18,214,"I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I"
200,18,215,"still have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and"
200,18,216,neglect have made an end of it.”
200,18,217,"This made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,"
200,18,218,"Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, “Wretched creature, you"
200,18,219,have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to
200,18,220,think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your
200,18,221,"betters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others"
200,18,222,"have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other"
200,18,223,beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among
200,18,224,"ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does"
200,18,225,with all those who drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the
200,18,226,Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the
200,18,227,"Lapithae. When the wine had got into his head, he went mad and did ill"
200,18,228,deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were
200,18,229,"there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and"
200,18,230,"nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house,"
200,18,231,"so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime, bereft of"
200,18,232,"understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between mankind and"
200,18,233,"the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own"
200,18,234,drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with
200,18,235,"you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here,"
200,18,236,"for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus, who kills every one"
200,18,237,"that comes near him: you will never get away alive, so drink and keep"
200,18,238,quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger than yourself.”
200,18,239,"Penelope then spoke to him. “Antinous,” said she, “it is not right that"
200,18,240,you should ill - treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house.
200,18,241,If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of
200,18,242,"Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make"
200,18,243,me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind:
200,18,244,none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all
200,18,245,reason.”
200,18,246,"“Queen Penelope,” answered Eurymachus, “we do not suppose that this man"
200,18,247,will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest
200,18,248,"some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go"
200,18,249,"gossiping about and say, ‘These suitors are a feeble folk; they are"
200,18,250,paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was
200,18,251,"able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung"
200,18,252,it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.’ This is what will be
200,18,253,"said, and it will be a scandal against us.”"
200,18,254,"“Eurymachus,” Penelope answered, “people who persist in eating up the"
200,18,255,estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect
200,18,256,others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as
200,18,257,"you think they will? This stranger is strong and well - built, he says"
200,18,258,"moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see"
200,18,259,whether he can string it or no. I say — and it shall surely be — that if
200,18,260,"Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a"
200,18,261,"cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and"
200,18,262,"robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see"
200,18,263,him sent safely wherever he wants to go.”
200,18,264,"Then Telemachus said, “Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in"
200,18,265,the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any one
200,18,266,have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the
200,18,267,"other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the"
200,18,268,"bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the"
200,18,269,"house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your"
200,18,270,"distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man’s matter,"
200,18,271,"and mine above all others, for it is I who am master here.”"
200,18,272,"She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in"
200,18,273,"her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she"
200,18,274,mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her
200,18,275,eyelids.
200,18,276,"The swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but"
200,18,277,"the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one"
200,18,278,"of them said, “You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out"
200,18,279,"of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your"
200,18,280,"own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place, and worry"
200,18,281,you to death.”
200,18,282,"Eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow"
200,18,283,"down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other"
200,18,284,"side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, “Father Eumaeus,"
200,18,285,"bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you"
200,18,286,"with stones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two. I"
200,18,287,wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as
200,18,288,"I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry, for"
200,18,289,they mean mischief.”
200,18,290,"Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put"
200,18,291,them in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on
200,18,292,"and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called"
200,18,293,"Euryclea apart and said to her, “Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to"
200,18,294,close the doors of the women’s apartments. If they hear any groaning or
200,18,295,"uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out,"
200,18,296,but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work.”
200,18,297,Euryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women’s
200,18,298,apartments.
200,18,299,Meanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the
200,18,300,outer court. There was a ship’s cable of byblus fibre lying in the
200,18,301,"gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again,"
200,18,302,"resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who"
200,18,303,"had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about,"
200,18,304,and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into
200,18,305,its two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his
200,18,306,"neighbour saying, “This is some tricky old bow - fancier; either he has"
200,18,307,"got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike"
200,18,308,style does the old vagabond handle it.”
200,18,309,"Another said, “I hope he may be no more successful in other things than"
200,18,310,he is likely to be in stringing this bow.”
200,18,311,"But Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung"
200,18,312,it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes
200,18,313,the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to
200,18,314,"prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the"
200,18,315,"twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour"
200,18,316,"as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a"
200,18,317,"sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the"
200,18,318,son of scheming Saturn had sent him.
200,18,319,He took an arrow that was lying upon the table165 — for those which the
200,18,320,Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver — he
200,18,321,"laid it on the centre - piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow"
200,18,322,"and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken"
200,18,323,"aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle - holes of"
200,18,324,"the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them,"
200,18,325,and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:
200,18,326,"“Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I"
200,18,327,"aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,"
200,18,328,"and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for"
200,18,329,"the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and then"
200,18,330,otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the
200,18,331,crowning ornaments of a banquet.”
200,18,332,"As he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on"
200,18,333,"his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father’s seat."
200,19,1,THE KILLING OF THE SUITORS — THE MAIDS WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES
200,19,2,ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.
200,19,3,"Then Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement"
200,19,4,with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to
200,19,5,"the ground at his feet and said, “The mighty contest is at an end. I"
200,19,6,will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark
200,19,7,which no man has yet hit.”
200,19,8,"On this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take up a"
200,19,9,two - handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands.
200,19,10,He had no thought of death — who amongst all the revellers would think
200,19,11,"that one man, however brave, would stand alone among so many and kill"
200,19,12,"him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the point went clean"
200,19,13,"through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup dropped from his"
200,19,14,"hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked"
200,19,15,"the table from him and upset the things on it, so that the bread and"
200,19,16,roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to the ground.166
200,19,17,The suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit;
200,19,18,they sprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked
200,19,19,"everywhere towards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear,"
200,19,20,"and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily. “Stranger,” said they, “you"
200,19,21,shall pay for shooting people in this way: you shall see no other
200,19,22,contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you have slain was the foremost
200,19,23,"youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour you for having killed"
200,19,24,him.”
200,19,25,"Thus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by"
200,19,26,"mistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of"
200,19,27,every one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:
200,19,28,"“Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have"
200,19,29,"wasted my substance,167 have forced my women servants to lie with you,"
200,19,30,and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared
200,19,31,"neither God nor man, and now you shall die.”"
200,19,32,"They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round"
200,19,33,"about to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone"
200,19,34,spoke.
200,19,35,"“If you are Ulysses,” said he, “then what you have said is just. We"
200,19,36,have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who
200,19,37,was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was all
200,19,38,his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so
200,19,39,"much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different, and"
200,19,40,Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son and to be
200,19,41,"chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met the death which"
200,19,42,"was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make everything"
200,19,43,"good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten"
200,19,44,"and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and"
200,19,45,we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened.
200,19,46,Until we have done this no one can complain of your being enraged
200,19,47,against us.”
200,19,48,"Ulysses again glared at him and said, “Though you should give me all"
200,19,49,"that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I"
200,19,50,will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must
200,19,51,"fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall.”"
200,19,52,"Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:"
200,19,53,"“My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he"
200,19,54,is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then
200,19,55,"show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from"
200,19,56,"his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him from the"
200,19,57,"pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town, and raise"
200,19,58,such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.”
200,19,59,"As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides,"
200,19,60,"and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly shot"
200,19,61,an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself
200,19,62,in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table.
200,19,63,The cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as he smote the
200,19,64,"earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the"
200,19,65,stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.
200,19,66,Then Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and
200,19,67,"get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him, and"
200,19,68,struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and
200,19,69,"went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and"
200,19,70,struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from
200,19,71,"him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he"
200,19,72,"stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack"
200,19,73,"at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at a run, and"
200,19,74,immediately was at his father’s side. Then he said:
200,19,75,"“Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for"
200,19,76,"your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour"
200,19,77,"for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.”"
200,19,78,"“Run and fetch them,” answered Ulysses, “while my arrows hold out, or"
200,19,79,when I am alone they may get me away from the door.”
200,19,80,"Telemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room where"
200,19,81,"the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four"
200,19,82,brass helmets with horse - hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to
200,19,83,"his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the"
200,19,84,"swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places near Ulysses."
200,19,85,"Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the"
200,19,86,"suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows"
200,19,87,"gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by"
200,19,88,"the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders;"
200,19,89,"on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of"
200,19,90,"horse - hair that nodded menacingly above it,168 and he grasped two"
200,19,91,redoubtable bronze - shod spears.
200,19,92,"Now there was a trap door169 on the wall, while at one end of the"
200,19,93,"pavement170 there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this"
200,19,94,exit was closed by a well - made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand
200,19,95,"by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a"
200,19,96,"time. But Agelaus shouted out, “Cannot some one go up to the trap door"
200,19,97,"and tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once, and we"
200,19,98,should soon make an end of this man and his shooting.”
200,19,99,"“This may not be, Agelaus,” answered Melanthius, “the mouth of the"
200,19,100,narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. One
200,19,101,brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I
200,19,102,"will do, I will bring you arms from the store - room, for I am sure it is"
200,19,103,there that Ulysses and his son have put them.”
200,19,104,On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store - room
200,19,105,"of Ulysses’ house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets"
200,19,106,"and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give them to"
200,19,107,the suitors. Ulysses’ heart began to fail him when he saw the
200,19,108,suitors171 putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He saw
200,19,109,"the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, “Some one of the"
200,19,110,"women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be"
200,19,111,Melanthius.”
200,19,112,"Telemachus answered, “The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left"
200,19,113,"the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I"
200,19,114,"have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the"
200,19,115,"women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the"
200,19,116,son of Dolius.”
200,19,117,Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the
200,19,118,"store room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to"
200,19,119,"Ulysses who was beside him, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that"
200,19,120,"scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to the store"
200,19,121,"room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall I"
200,19,122,bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many
200,19,123,wrongs that he has done in your house?”
200,19,124,"Ulysses answered, “Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check,"
200,19,125,no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius’ hands
200,19,126,and feet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door
200,19,127,"fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him"
200,19,128,"close up to the rafters from a high bearing - post,172 that he may linger"
200,19,129,on in an agony.”
200,19,130,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the"
200,19,131,"store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was"
200,19,132,"busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two"
200,19,133,took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by
200,19,134,"Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old dry - rotted"
200,19,135,"shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young,"
200,19,136,"but which had been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become"
200,19,137,"unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and"
200,19,138,threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well
200,19,139,"behind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses"
200,19,140,had told them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him
200,19,141,"up from a high pillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him"
200,19,142,"did you then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus saying, “Melanthius, you will"
200,19,143,pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well
200,19,144,"when morning comes from the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you"
200,19,145,to be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast on.”
200,19,146,"There, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on"
200,19,147,their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take
200,19,148,their places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the
200,19,149,"cloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the"
200,19,150,body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove’s daughter
200,19,151,"Minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of Mentor."
200,19,152,"Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, “Mentor, lend me your help,"
200,19,153,"and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done"
200,19,154,"you. Besides, you are my age - mate.”"
200,19,155,"But all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the"
200,19,156,other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to
200,19,157,"reproach her. “Mentor,” he cried, “do not let Ulysses beguile you into"
200,19,158,siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when
200,19,159,"we have killed these people, father and son, we will kill you too. You"
200,19,160,"shall pay for it with your head, and when we have killed you, we will"
200,19,161,"take all you have, in doors or out, and bring it into hotch - pot with"
200,19,162,"Ulysses’ property; we will not let your sons live in your house, nor"
200,19,163,"your daughters, nor shall your widow continue to live in the city of"
200,19,164,Ithaca.”
200,19,165,"This made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very"
200,19,166,"angrily.173 “Ulysses,” said she, “your strength and prowess are no"
200,19,167,longer what they were when you fought for nine long years among the
200,19,168,Trojans about the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those
200,19,169,"days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam’s city was taken."
200,19,170,How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are
200,19,171,"on your own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house?"
200,19,172,"Come on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of"
200,19,173,Alcimus shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred
200,19,174,upon him.”
200,19,175,"But she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still"
200,19,176,"further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew"
200,19,177,up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in
200,19,178,the form of a swallow.
200,19,179,"Meanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,"
200,19,180,"Pisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon"
200,19,181,the suitors’ side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives
200,19,182,"they were by far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen"
200,19,183,"under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said, “My"
200,19,184,"friends, he will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away after"
200,19,185,having done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the doors
200,19,186,"unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your"
200,19,187,"spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by"
200,19,188,killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the
200,19,189,others.”
200,19,190,"They threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of"
200,19,191,no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the
200,19,192,pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had
200,19,193,"avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own men, “My"
200,19,194,"friends, I should say we too had better let drive into the middle of"
200,19,195,"them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us by killing us"
200,19,196,outright.”
200,19,197,They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.
200,19,198,"Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while"
200,19,199,"the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others"
200,19,200,drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained
200,19,201,their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.
200,19,202,"The suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their"
200,19,203,weapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing - post of the
200,19,204,cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of
200,19,205,"another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top"
200,19,206,"skin from off Telemachus’s wrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze"
200,19,207,Eumaeus’s shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to
200,19,208,the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd of
200,19,209,"suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus"
200,19,210,"Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and"
200,19,211,"taunted him saying, “Foul - mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so"
200,19,212,"foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your"
200,19,213,"speech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present of"
200,19,214,this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when he
200,19,215,was begging about in his own house.”
200,19,216,"Thus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a"
200,19,217,"spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in"
200,19,218,"the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell forward"
200,19,219,full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat on the
200,19,220,"rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors quailed."
200,19,221,They fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened
200,19,222,by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their longest. As
200,19,223,"eagle - beaked, crook - taloned vultures from the mountains swoop down on"
200,19,224,"the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill them,"
200,19,225,"for they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on enjoy the"
200,19,226,sport — even so did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite
200,19,227,them on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their brains were
200,19,228,"being battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood."
200,19,229,"Leiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, “Ulysses I beseech"
200,19,230,you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women
200,19,231,"in your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I"
200,19,232,"saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for their"
200,19,233,"folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die"
200,19,234,"without having done anything to deserve it, and shall have got no"
200,19,235,thanks for all the good that I did.”
200,19,236,"Ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, “If you were their"
200,19,237,"sacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be"
200,19,238,"long before I got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have"
200,19,239,children by her. Therefore you shall die.”
200,19,240,With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when
200,19,241,"he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he"
200,19,242,"struck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling"
200,19,243,in the dust while he was yet speaking.
200,19,244,The minstrel Phemius son of Terpes — he who had been forced by the
200,19,245,suitors to sing to them — now tried to save his life. He was standing
200,19,246,"near towards the trap door,174 and held his lyre in his hand. He did"
200,19,247,not know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar
200,19,248,"of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and"
200,19,249,"Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to go"
200,19,250,"straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he deemed"
200,19,251,it best to embrace Ulysses’ knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground
200,19,252,between the mixing bowl 175 and the silver - studded seat; then going up
200,19,253,"to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, “Ulysses, I beseech"
200,19,254,you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards
200,19,255,if you kill a bard who can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make
200,19,256,"all my lays myself, and heaven visits me with every kind of"
200,19,257,"inspiration. I would sing to you as though you were a god, do not"
200,19,258,therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your own son
200,19,259,Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent your house and
200,19,260,"sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many and too"
200,19,261,"strong for me, so they made me.”"
200,19,262,"Telemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. “Hold!” he"
200,19,263,"cried, “the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will spare Medon"
200,19,264,"too, who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or"
200,19,265,"Eumaeus has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you"
200,19,266,were raging about the court.”
200,19,267,"Medon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a"
200,19,268,seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly
200,19,269,"flayed heifer’s hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus,"
200,19,270,and laid hold of his knees.
200,19,271,"“Here I am, my dear sir,” said he, “stay your hand therefore, and tell"
200,19,272,"your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for"
200,19,273,having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to
200,19,274,yourself.”
200,19,275,"Ulysses smiled at him and answered, “Fear not; Telemachus has saved"
200,19,276,"your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people, how"
200,19,277,"greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore,"
200,19,278,"outside the cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way of"
200,19,279,the slaughter — you and the bard — while I finish my work here inside.”
200,19,280,"The pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down"
200,19,281,"by Jove’s great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting"
200,19,282,that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court
200,19,283,"carefully over, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was"
200,19,284,"still living, but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in"
200,19,285,their blood. They were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of
200,19,286,"the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the"
200,19,287,heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying
200,19,288,all huddled up one against the other.
200,19,289,"Then Ulysses said to Telemachus, “Call nurse Euryclea; I have something"
200,19,290,to say to her.”
200,19,291,Telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women’s room. “Make
200,19,292,"haste,” said he, “you old woman who have been set over all the other"
200,19,293,women in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you.”
200,19,294,When Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women’s room
200,19,295,"and came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses"
200,19,296,bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been
200,19,297,"devouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so"
200,19,298,that he is a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses besmirched from head to
200,19,299,foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of
200,19,300,"blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great"
200,19,301,"deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, “Old woman,” said he,"
200,19,302,"“rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about"
200,19,303,it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven’s doom and
200,19,304,"their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction, for they"
200,19,305,"respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came"
200,19,306,"near them, and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for their"
200,19,307,"wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women in the"
200,19,308,"house have misconducted themselves, and who are innocent.”176"
200,19,309,"“I will tell you the truth, my son,” answered Euryclea. “There are"
200,19,310,"fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding"
200,19,311,"wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all177 have"
200,19,312,"misbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to"
200,19,313,"Penelope. They showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only"
200,19,314,lately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to the
200,19,315,female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that has
200,19,316,"happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.”"
200,19,317,"“Do not wake her yet,” answered Ulysses, “but tell the women who have"
200,19,318,misconducted themselves to come to me.”
200,19,319,"Euryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to"
200,19,320,"Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the"
200,19,321,"swineherd. “Begin,” said he, “to remove the dead, and make the women"
200,19,322,"help you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables"
200,19,323,"and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take"
200,19,324,the women into the space between the domed room and the wall of the
200,19,325,"outer court, and run them through with your swords till they are quite"
200,19,326,"dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used"
200,19,327,to lie in secret with the suitors.”
200,19,328,"On this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly."
200,19,329,"First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one"
200,19,330,another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do
200,19,331,"their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When they had"
200,19,332,"done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and"
200,19,333,"water, while Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood and"
200,19,334,"dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away and put it out"
200,19,335,of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean and
200,19,336,"orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space"
200,19,337,"between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so that they"
200,19,338,"could not get away: and Telemachus said to the other two, “I shall not"
200,19,339,"let these women die a clean death, for they were insolent to me and my"
200,19,340,"mother, and used to sleep with the suitors.”"
200,19,341,So saying he made a ship’s cable fast to one of the bearing - posts that
200,19,342,"supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the"
200,19,343,"building, at a good height, lest any of the women’s feet should touch"
200,19,344,the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been
200,19,345,"set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their nest, and"
200,19,346,"a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have to put their"
200,19,347,heads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably.178 Their
200,19,348,"feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long."
200,19,349,"As for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner"
200,19,350,court. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his
200,19,351,"vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut"
200,19,352,off his hands and his feet.
200,19,353,When they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back
200,19,354,"into the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the dear old"
200,19,355,"nurse Euryclea, “Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and"
200,19,356,"fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters. Go,"
200,19,357,"moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants, and also"
200,19,358,all the maidservants that are in the house.”
200,19,359,"“All that you have said is true,” answered Euryclea, “but let me bring"
200,19,360,you some clean clothes — a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on
200,19,361,your back any longer. It is not right.”
200,19,362,"“First light me a fire,” replied Ulysses."
200,19,363,"She brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses"
200,19,364,thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts.
200,19,365,Then she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened;
200,19,366,"whereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands, and"
200,19,367,"pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders"
200,19,368,and taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like to
200,19,369,"weep, for he remembered every one of them.179"
200,20,1,PENELOPE EVENTUALLY RECOGNISES HER HUSBAND — EARLY IN THE MORNING
200,20,2,"ULYSSES, TELEMACHUS, EUMAEUS, AND PHILOETIUS LEAVE THE TOWN."
200,20,3,Euryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear
200,20,4,husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet
200,20,5,were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her
200,20,6,"head to speak to her. “Wake up Penelope, my dear child,” she exclaimed,"
200,20,7,“and see with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this
200,20,8,"long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home again, and has"
200,20,9,"killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble in his house, eating"
200,20,10,up his estate and ill treating his son.”
200,20,11,"“My good nurse,” answered Penelope, “you must be mad. The gods"
200,20,12,"sometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, and make"
200,20,13,foolish people become sensible. This is what they must have been doing
200,20,14,to you; for you always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you
200,20,15,"thus mock me when I have trouble enough already — talking such nonsense,"
200,20,16,and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my
200,20,17,eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from the day my
200,20,18,poor husband went to that city with the ill - omened name. Go back again
200,20,19,into the women’s room; if it had been any one else who had woke me up
200,20,20,to bring me such absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe
200,20,21,scolding. As it is your age shall protect you.”
200,20,22,"“My dear child,” answered Euryclea, “I am not mocking you. It is quite"
200,20,23,true as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger
200,20,24,whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus
200,20,25,"knew all the time that he was come back, but kept his father’s secret"
200,20,26,that he might have his revenge on all these wicked people.”
200,20,27,"Then Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea,"
200,20,28,"and wept for joy. “But my dear nurse,” said she, “explain this to me;"
200,20,29,"if he has really come home as you say, how did he manage to overcome"
200,20,30,"the wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there"
200,20,31,always were?”
200,20,32,"“I was not there,” answered Euryclea, “and do not know; I only heard"
200,20,33,them groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and
200,20,34,"huddled up in a corner of the women’s room with the doors closed, till"
200,20,35,your son came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found
200,20,36,Ulysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all
200,20,37,"round him, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you"
200,20,38,could have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and
200,20,39,"filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled"
200,20,40,"up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a"
200,20,41,great fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call
200,20,42,"you, so come with me that you may both be happy together after all; for"
200,20,43,now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband
200,20,44,"is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, and to take his"
200,20,45,revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so badly to him.”
200,20,46,"“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “do not exult too confidently over all"
200,20,47,this. You know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses come
200,20,48,"home — more particularly myself, and the son who has been born to both of"
200,20,49,us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is
200,20,50,"angry with the suitors for their great wickedness, and has made an end"
200,20,51,"of them; for they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor"
200,20,52,"poor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad end in"
200,20,53,consequence of their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away from the
200,20,54,Achaean land; he will never return home again.”
200,20,55,"Then nurse Euryclea said, “My child, what are you talking about? but"
200,20,56,you were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your
200,20,57,"husband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own"
200,20,58,fire side at this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof;
200,20,59,when I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave
200,20,60,"him, and I wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not"
200,20,61,"let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I will"
200,20,62,"make this bargain with you — if I am deceiving you, you may have me"
200,20,63,killed by the most cruel death you can think of.”
200,20,64,"“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “however wise you may be you can hardly"
200,20,65,"fathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of"
200,20,66,"my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has"
200,20,67,killed them.”
200,20,68,"On this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she"
200,20,69,considered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband and
200,20,70,"question him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace"
200,20,71,"him. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister,"
200,20,72,"she sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the wall at right"
200,20,73,"angles180 [to that by which she had entered], while Ulysses sat near"
200,20,74,"one of the bearing - posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting to see"
200,20,75,what his brave wife would say to him when she saw him. For a long time
200,20,76,she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked
200,20,77,"him full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his"
200,20,78,"shabby clothes and failed to recognise him,181 till Telemachus began to"
200,20,79,reproach her and said:
200,20,80,“Mother — but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name — why
200,20,81,do you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by his
200,20,82,side and begin talking to him and asking him questions? No other woman
200,20,83,could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her
200,20,84,"after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through so much;"
200,20,85,but your heart always was as hard as a stone.”
200,20,86,"Penelope answered, “My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can"
200,20,87,find no words in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I
200,20,88,"cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is"
200,20,89,"Ulysses come back to his own home again, we shall get to understand one"
200,20,90,"another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we two are"
200,20,91,"alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others.”"
200,20,92,"Ulysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, “Let your mother put me"
200,20,93,to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently.
200,20,94,"She rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else,"
200,20,95,"because I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us,"
200,20,96,"however, consider what we had better do next. When one man has killed"
200,20,97,another — even though he was not one who would leave many friends to take
200,20,98,up his quarrel — the man who has killed him must still say good bye to
200,20,99,his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing the stay
200,20,100,"of a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you"
200,20,101,consider this matter.”
200,20,102,"“Look to it yourself, father,” answered Telemachus, “for they say you"
200,20,103,"are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other"
200,20,104,mortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right good
200,20,105,"will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength holds"
200,20,106,out.”
200,20,107,"“I will say what I think will be best,” answered Ulysses. “First wash"
200,20,108,and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and
200,20,109,"dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that"
200,20,110,"if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some one going"
200,20,111,"along the street happens to notice it, they may think there is a"
200,20,112,"wedding in the house, and no rumours about the death of the suitors"
200,20,113,"will get about in the town, before we can escape to the woods upon my"
200,20,114,"own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven"
200,20,115,vouchsafes us shall seem wisest.”
200,20,116,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed"
200,20,117,"and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took"
200,20,118,his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The
200,20,119,"house re - echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people"
200,20,120,"outside said, “I suppose the queen has been getting married at last."
200,20,121,She ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect her
200,20,122,husband’s property until he comes home.”182
200,20,123,"This was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had"
200,20,124,been happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses
200,20,125,"in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him"
200,20,126,look taller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow thick
200,20,127,"on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;"
200,20,128,she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skilful
200,20,129,workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva — and
200,20,130,his work is full of beauty — enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding
200,20,131,"it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat"
200,20,132,"down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. “My dear,” said he,"
200,20,133,“heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever
200,20,134,yet had. No other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when
200,20,135,"he had come back to her after twenty years of absence, and after having"
200,20,136,"gone through so much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will"
200,20,137,"sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard as iron.”"
200,20,138,"“My dear,” answered Penelope, “I have no wish to set myself up, nor to"
200,20,139,"depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very well"
200,20,140,remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.
200,20,141,"Nevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he"
200,20,142,"himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it"
200,20,143,"with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.”"
200,20,144,"She said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, “Wife, I"
200,20,145,am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has been
200,20,146,taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found it
200,20,147,"a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god"
200,20,148,"came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living, however strong"
200,20,149,"and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for it is a"
200,20,150,marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a
200,20,151,"young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour,"
200,20,152,and about as thick as a bearing - post. I built my room round this with
200,20,153,"strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors"
200,20,154,strong and well - fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive
200,20,155,tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root
200,20,156,"upwards and then worked with carpenter’s tools well and skilfully,"
200,20,157,"straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into"
200,20,158,"a bed - prop. I then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the"
200,20,159,"centre - post of my bed, at which I worked till I had finished it,"
200,20,160,inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched a hide of
200,20,161,crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you see I know all
200,20,162,"about it, and I desire to learn whether it is still there, or whether"
200,20,163,any one has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its
200,20,164,roots.”
200,20,165,"When she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke"
200,20,166,"down. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck, and"
200,20,167,"kissed him. “Do not be angry with me Ulysses,” she cried, “you, who are"
200,20,168,"the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied"
200,20,169,"us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing old, together;"
200,20,170,do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you
200,20,171,thus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all the time through
200,20,172,fear that someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story;
200,20,173,for there are many very wicked people going about. Jove’s daughter
200,20,174,"Helen would never have yielded herself to a man from a foreign country,"
200,20,175,if she had known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and
200,20,176,"bring her back. Heaven put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no"
200,20,177,"thought to that sin, which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now,"
200,20,178,"however, that you have convinced me by showing that you know all about"
200,20,179,our bed (which no human being has ever seen but you and I and a single
200,20,180,"maidservant, the daughter of Actor, who was given me by my father on my"
200,20,181,"marriage, and who keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I"
200,20,182,have been I can mistrust no longer.”
200,20,183,"Then Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and"
200,20,184,faithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men who
200,20,185,"are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship"
200,20,186,"with the fury of his winds and waves; a few alone reach the land, and"
200,20,187,"these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves on"
200,20,188,firm ground and out of danger — even so was her husband welcome to her as
200,20,189,"she looked upon him, and she could not tear her two fair arms from"
200,20,190,about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow
200,20,191,"till rosy - fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined otherwise,"
200,20,192,"and held night back in the far west, while she would not suffer Dawn to"
200,20,193,"leave Oceanus, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear"
200,20,194,her onward to break the day upon mankind.
200,20,195,"At last, however, Ulysses said, “Wife, we have not yet reached the end"
200,20,196,of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo. It
200,20,197,"is long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus the"
200,20,198,"shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I went"
200,20,199,down into Hades to ask about my return and that of my companions. But
200,20,200,"now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon"
200,20,201,of sleep.”
200,20,202,"“You shall go to bed as soon as you please,” replied Penelope, “now"
200,20,203,that the gods have sent you home to your own good house and to your
200,20,204,"country. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell me"
200,20,205,about the task that lies before you. I shall have to hear about it
200,20,206,"later, so it is better that I should be told at once.”"
200,20,207,"“My dear,” answered Ulysses, “why should you press me to tell you?"
200,20,208,"Still, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it. I"
200,20,209,"do not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide,"
200,20,210,"carrying an oar, till I came to a country where the people have never"
200,20,211,"heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. They know"
200,20,212,"nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave"
200,20,213,me this certain token which I will not hide from you. He said that a
200,20,214,wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel
200,20,215,"that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my oar in the ground"
200,20,216,"and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune; after which I was"
200,20,217,"to go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven, one after the"
200,20,218,"other. As for myself, he said that death should come to me from the"
200,20,219,"sea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when I was full of"
200,20,220,"years and peace of mind, and my people should bless me. All this, he"
200,20,221,"said, should surely come to pass.”"
200,20,222,"And Penelope said, “If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier"
200,20,223,"time in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from"
200,20,224,misfortune.”
200,20,225,Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches
200,20,226,and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid
200,20,227,"them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the"
200,20,228,bed chamber woman Eurynome183 to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed by
200,20,229,"torch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went back,"
200,20,230,and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.
200,20,231,"Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and"
200,20,232,made the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep
200,20,233,in the cloisters.
200,20,234,When Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking
200,20,235,with one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing
200,20,236,the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many
200,20,237,"sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of wine."
200,20,238,"Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much trouble"
200,20,239,"he had himself given to other people. He told her everything, and she"
200,20,240,was so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till he had
200,20,241,ended his whole story.
200,20,242,"He began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached"
200,20,243,the fertile land of the Lotus - eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops
200,20,244,and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave
200,20,245,"comrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably"
200,20,246,"and furthered him on his way, but even so he was not to reach home, for"
200,20,247,to his great grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how he
200,20,248,"went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed"
200,20,249,"all his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only."
200,20,250,"Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to the"
200,20,251,"chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet"
200,20,252,"Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who"
200,20,253,bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the
200,20,254,"wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and"
200,20,255,"terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in"
200,20,256,"safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun - god, and how Jove"
200,20,257,"therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, so that all his men"
200,20,258,"perished together, himself alone being left alive; how at last he"
200,20,259,"reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso, who kept him there in"
200,20,260,"a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in which case she"
200,20,261,"intended making him immortal so that he should never grow old, but she"
200,20,262,could not persuade him to let her do so; and how after much suffering
200,20,263,"he had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though"
200,20,264,"he had been a god, and sent him back in a ship to his own country after"
200,20,265,"having given him gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was"
200,20,266,"the last thing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold"
200,20,267,upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows.
200,20,268,Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that
200,20,269,"Ulysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold - enthroned"
200,20,270,Dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On
200,20,271,"this, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope,"
200,20,272,"“Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here, in"
200,20,273,"lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home though"
200,20,274,"I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however, that we have at last"
200,20,275,"come together, take care of the property that is in the house. As for"
200,20,276,"the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take"
200,20,277,"many myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to"
200,20,278,make good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now
200,20,279,going to the wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has
200,20,280,"so long been grieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these"
200,20,281,"instructions, though you have little need of them. At sunrise it will"
200,20,282,"at once get abroad that I have been killing the suitors; go upstairs,"
200,20,283,"therefore,184 and stay there with your women. See nobody and ask no"
200,20,284,questions.”185
200,20,285,"As he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus,"
200,20,286,"Philoetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also."
200,20,287,"This they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they opened"
200,20,288,"the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now"
200,20,289,"daylight, but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led"
200,20,290,them quickly out of the town.
200,21,1,THE GHOSTS OF THE SUITORS IN HADES — ULYSSES AND HIS MEN GO TO THE HOUSE
200,21,2,"OF LAERTES — THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA COME OUT TO ATTACK ULYSSES, BUT MINERVA"
200,21,3,CONCLUDES A PEACE.
200,21,4,"Then Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his"
200,21,5,hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men’s eyes in
200,21,6,sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts
200,21,7,"and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind him. As"
200,21,8,"bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one of them"
200,21,9,"has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even so did the"
200,21,10,ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow led them down
200,21,11,into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of
200,21,12,"Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the gates of the sun and the"
200,21,13,"land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell"
200,21,14,the souls and shadows of them that can labour no more.
200,21,15,"Here they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of"
200,21,16,"Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man"
200,21,17,of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.
200,21,18,"They gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of"
200,21,19,"Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also"
200,21,20,the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of
200,21,21,Aegisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.
200,21,22,"“Son of Atreus,” it said, “we used to say that Jove had loved you"
200,21,23,"better from first to last than any other hero, for you were captain"
200,21,24,"over many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before"
200,21,25,"Troy; yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon"
200,21,26,you all too early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the hey - day
200,21,27,"of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your"
200,21,28,"ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good name, whereas it"
200,21,29,has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.”
200,21,30,"“Happy son of Peleus,” answered the ghost of Agamemnon, “for having"
200,21,31,"died at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the"
200,21,32,Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the
200,21,33,"whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now of your"
200,21,34,"chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should we ever"
200,21,35,"have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us. Then, when"
200,21,36,"we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid you on your bed"
200,21,37,and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments. The
200,21,38,"Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother,"
200,21,39,"when she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and"
200,21,40,the sound of a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the
200,21,41,Achaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled panic - stricken to their
200,21,42,ships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked
200,21,43,"them saying, ‘Hold, Argives, fly not sons of the Achaeans, this is his"
200,21,44,mother coming from the sea with her immortal nymphs to view the body of
200,21,45,her son.’
200,21,46,"“Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the"
200,21,47,"old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in"
200,21,48,immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet
200,21,49,voices in lament — calling and answering one another; there was not an
200,21,50,Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights
200,21,51,"seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the"
200,21,52,"eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep with"
200,21,53,many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in
200,21,54,"raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,"
200,21,55,"horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were"
200,21,56,"burning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of"
200,21,57,"heaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak"
200,21,58,and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a
200,21,59,"golden vase to hold them — gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself;"
200,21,60,in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus who had
200,21,61,"gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those of Antilochus, who"
200,21,62,had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that
200,21,63,Patroclus was no more.
200,21,64,"“Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point"
200,21,65,"jutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far"
200,21,66,out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born
200,21,67,"hereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them to"
200,21,68,be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been
200,21,69,"present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird"
200,21,70,themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some
200,21,71,"great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver - footed Thetis"
200,21,72,offered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death
200,21,73,"your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore"
200,21,74,"among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my"
200,21,75,"fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the"
200,21,76,hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.”
200,21,77,"Thus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with the"
200,21,78,ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of
200,21,79,"Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to"
200,21,80,them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of
200,21,81,"Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began to"
200,21,82,talk to him.
200,21,83,"“Amphimedon,” it said, “what has happened to all you fine young men — all"
200,21,84,of an age too — that you are come down here under the ground? One could
200,21,85,pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds
200,21,86,"and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an"
200,21,87,end of you on the mainland when you were cattle - lifting or
200,21,88,"sheep - stealing, or while fighting in defence of their wives and city?"
200,21,89,"Answer my question, for I have been your guest. Do you not remember how"
200,21,90,"I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to join us with"
200,21,91,his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume our
200,21,92,"voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.”"
200,21,93,"And the ghost of Amphimedon answered, “Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king"
200,21,94,"of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you"
200,21,95,fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.
200,21,96,"Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did not"
200,21,97,"say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters to an"
200,21,98,"end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this, then, was the"
200,21,99,trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and
200,21,100,"began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. ‘Sweethearts,’"
200,21,101,"said she, ‘Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry"
200,21,102,again immediately; wait — for I would not have my skill in needlework
200,21,103,"perish unrecorded — till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,"
200,21,104,"against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the"
200,21,105,women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.’ This is
200,21,106,"what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon"
200,21,107,"her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches"
200,21,108,again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without
200,21,109,"our finding it out, but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth"
200,21,110,"year, in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished, one"
200,21,111,"of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in"
200,21,112,"the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether she would"
200,21,113,"or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had"
200,21,114,"it washed,186 its splendour was as that of the sun or moon."
200,21,115,“Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his
200,21,116,"swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from a"
200,21,117,"voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched"
200,21,118,"their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after"
200,21,119,"him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and"
200,21,120,leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came
200,21,121,"so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among"
200,21,122,"us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being"
200,21,123,"struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but"
200,21,124,"when the will of Aegis - bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus"
200,21,125,"took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors"
200,21,126,behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a
200,21,127,quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill - fated suitors; and this
200,21,128,"was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string the"
200,21,129,"bow — nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the hands of Ulysses,"
200,21,130,"we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, no matter"
200,21,131,"what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he"
200,21,132,had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow
200,21,133,through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured
200,21,134,"his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed"
200,21,135,"Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly"
200,21,136,darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of
200,21,137,"the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us with might and main"
200,21,138,"throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as"
200,21,139,"our brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with our"
200,21,140,"blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are"
200,21,141,"lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at"
200,21,142,"home do not yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out"
200,21,143,"and wash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according"
200,21,144,to the offices due to the departed.”
200,21,145,"“Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,” replied the ghost of Agamemnon, “you"
200,21,146,are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare
200,21,147,"excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as"
200,21,148,"Penelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue"
200,21,149,"shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be"
200,21,150,welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far
200,21,151,otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus who killed
200,21,152,"her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has"
200,21,153,brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.”
200,21,154,Thus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the
200,21,155,bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the
200,21,156,"town and soon reached the fair and well - tilled farm of Laertes, which"
200,21,157,"he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with a"
200,21,158,"lean - to running all round it, where the slaves who worked for him slept"
200,21,159,"and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman,"
200,21,160,"who looked after him in this his country - farm. When Ulysses got there,"
200,21,161,he said to his son and to the other two:
200,21,162,"“Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner."
200,21,163,"Meanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to"
200,21,164,recognise me after so long an absence.”
200,21,165,"He then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who"
200,21,166,"went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard to"
200,21,167,"make trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he"
200,21,168,"did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for"
200,21,169,"they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the"
200,21,170,place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father
200,21,171,"alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very"
200,21,172,shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him
200,21,173,"from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat"
200,21,174,"skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe - begone. When Ulysses saw"
200,21,175,"him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall"
200,21,176,"pear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss"
200,21,177,"him, and tell him all about his having come home, or whether he should"
200,21,178,first question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it
200,21,179,"best to be crafty with him, so in this mind he went up to his father,"
200,21,180,who was bending down and digging about a plant.
200,21,181,"“I see, sir,” said Ulysses, “that you are an excellent gardener — what"
200,21,182,"pains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not a"
200,21,183,"fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of"
200,21,184,"your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I"
200,21,185,say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are
200,21,186,"old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle"
200,21,187,"that your master takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and"
200,21,188,"figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble"
200,21,189,birth. I should have said that you were one of those who should wash
200,21,190,"well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do;"
200,21,191,"but tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose"
200,21,192,garden are you working? Tell me also about another matter. Is this
200,21,193,place that I have come to really Ithaca? I met a man just now who said
200,21,194,"so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience to hear my story"
200,21,195,"out when I was asking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was"
200,21,196,"still living, or was already dead and in the house of Hades. Believe me"
200,21,197,when I tell you that this man came to my house once when I was in my
200,21,198,own country and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I liked
200,21,199,better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father
200,21,200,"was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him"
200,21,201,"welcome to all the abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave"
200,21,202,"him all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and"
200,21,203,a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve
200,21,204,"light cloaks, and as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve"
200,21,205,"cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal"
200,21,206,number of shirts. To all this I added four good looking women skilled
200,21,207,"in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.”"
200,21,208,"His father shed tears and answered, “Sir, you have indeed come to the"
200,21,209,"country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked"
200,21,210,people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If
200,21,211,"you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have"
200,21,212,entertained you hospitably and would have requited your presents amply
200,21,213,when you left him — as would have been only right considering what you
200,21,214,"had already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is"
200,21,215,"it since you entertained this guest — my unhappy son, as ever was? Alas!"
200,21,216,He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have
200,21,217,"eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some"
200,21,218,"continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents,"
200,21,219,"could throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could"
200,21,220,his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as
200,21,221,"was natural upon his death bed, and close his eyes according to the"
200,21,222,"offices due to the departed. But now, tell me truly for I want to know."
200,21,223,Who and whence are you — tell me of your town and parents? Where is the
200,21,224,ship lying that has brought you and your men to Ithaca? Or were you a
200,21,225,"passenger on some other man’s ship, and those who brought you here have"
200,21,226,gone on their way and left you?”
200,21,227,"“I will tell you everything,” answered Ulysses, “quite truly. I come"
200,21,228,"from Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who"
200,21,229,is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off
200,21,230,"my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here"
200,21,231,"against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open"
200,21,232,"country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left"
200,21,233,"my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left"
200,21,234,"me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced"
200,21,235,"to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have"
200,21,236,another friendly meeting and exchange presents.”
200,21,237,A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both
200,21,238,hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey
200,21,239,"head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched,"
200,21,240,and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang
200,21,241,"towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, “I am he,"
200,21,242,"father, about whom you are asking — I have returned after having been"
200,21,243,away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation — we have
200,21,244,"no time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the"
200,21,245,"suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes.”"
200,21,246,"“If you really are my son Ulysses,” replied Laertes, “and have come"
200,21,247,"back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity as"
200,21,248,shall convince me.”
200,21,249,"“First observe this scar,” answered Ulysses, “which I got from a boar’s"
200,21,250,tusk when I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me
200,21,251,"to Autolycus, my mother’s father, to receive the presents which when he"
200,21,252,was over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out
200,21,253,"to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all"
200,21,254,"about them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all,"
200,21,255,and you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me
200,21,256,"thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also"
200,21,257,said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted
200,21,258,"between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of"
200,21,259,heaven has been laid heavy upon them.”
200,21,260,Laertes’ strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which
200,21,261,"his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to"
200,21,262,"support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he"
200,21,263,"came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, “O father"
200,21,264,"Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have"
200,21,265,"really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am"
200,21,266,much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here
200,21,267,"directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the"
200,21,268,cities of the Cephallenians.”
200,21,269,"Ulysses answered, “Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that,"
200,21,270,but let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told
200,21,271,"Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready"
200,21,272,as soon as possible.”
200,21,273,Thus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got
200,21,274,there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting
200,21,275,up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took
200,21,276,Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on
200,21,277,"a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a more imposing"
200,21,278,"presence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back"
200,21,279,"his son was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal, and said"
200,21,280,"to him, “My dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much"
200,21,281,taller and better - looking.”
200,21,282,"Laertes answered, “Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I"
200,21,283,"were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took"
200,21,284,"Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I"
200,21,285,"then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on, I"
200,21,286,should have been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors.
200,21,287,"I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced"
200,21,288,to see it.”
200,21,289,"Thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their"
200,21,290,"work and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his"
200,21,291,proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and
200,21,292,"by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their"
200,21,293,"mother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was"
200,21,294,"growing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were"
200,21,295,"certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses"
200,21,296,"scolded them good naturedly and said, “Sit down to your dinner, old"
200,21,297,"man, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin"
200,21,298,for some time and have been waiting for you.”
200,21,299,"Then Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. “Sir,” said"
200,21,300,"he, seizing his master’s hand and kissing it at the wrist, “we have"
200,21,301,long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after
200,21,302,"we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper"
200,21,303,"you.187 But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or"
200,21,304,shall we send some one to tell her?”
200,21,305,"“Old man,” answered Ulysses, “she knows already, so you need not"
200,21,306,"trouble about that.” On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius"
200,21,307,gathered round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after
200,21,308,the other; then they took their seats in due order near Dolius their
200,21,309,father.
200,21,310,"While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round"
200,21,311,"the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the"
200,21,312,"suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered"
200,21,313,"from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses."
200,21,314,"They took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies"
200,21,315,"of those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the"
200,21,316,fishermen to take each of them to his own place. They then met angrily
200,21,317,"in the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes"
200,21,318,rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son
200,21,319,"Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said,"
200,21,320,"weeping bitterly, “My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great"
200,21,321,"wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he"
200,21,322,"has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been"
200,21,323,killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and
200,21,324,"doing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule,"
200,21,325,or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an
200,21,326,everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons
200,21,327,"and brothers. For my own part I should have no more pleasure in life,"
200,21,328,"but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before"
200,21,329,they can cross over to the main land.”
200,21,330,He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard
200,21,331,"Phemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses."
200,21,332,"Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle"
200,21,333,"of the assembly, and Medon said, “Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did"
200,21,334,not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an
200,21,335,immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god
200,21,336,"appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously"
200,21,337,about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on
200,21,338,one another.”
200,21,339,"On this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of"
200,21,340,"Mastor, rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both"
200,21,341,"past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty,"
200,21,342,"saying,"
200,21,343,"“Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as"
200,21,344,"they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we bade"
200,21,345,you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the
200,21,346,wantonness of their hearts — wasting the substance and dishonouring the
200,21,347,"wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however,"
200,21,348,"let it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against"
200,21,349,"Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your"
200,21,350,own heads.”
200,21,351,"This was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at"
200,21,352,"once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the"
200,21,353,"speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;"
200,21,354,"they therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed"
200,21,355,"themselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led"
200,21,356,them on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the murder of
200,21,357,"his son, whereas in truth he was never to return, but was himself to"
200,21,358,perish in his attempt.
200,21,359,"Then Minerva said to Jove, “Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,"
200,21,360,answer me this question — What do you propose to do? Will you set them
200,21,361,"fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?”"
200,21,362,"And Jove answered, “My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your"
200,21,363,own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the
200,21,364,"suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be"
200,21,365,"most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them"
200,21,366,"swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to"
200,21,367,"rule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of"
200,21,368,their sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as
200,21,369,"heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.”"
200,21,370,"This was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she"
200,21,371,darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.
200,21,372,"Now when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by"
200,21,373,"saying, “Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up to"
200,21,374,us.” So one of Dolius’s sons went as he was bid. Standing on the
200,21,375,"threshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses, “Here"
200,21,376,"they are, let us put on our armour at once.”"
200,21,377,"They put on their armour as fast as they could — that is to say Ulysses,"
200,21,378,"his three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius did"
200,21,379,the same — warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they
200,21,380,"had all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth,"
200,21,381,Ulysses leading the way.
200,21,382,"Then Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form"
200,21,383,"and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to his"
200,21,384,"son Telemachus, “Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an"
200,21,385,"engagement, which will show every man’s mettle, be sure not to disgrace"
200,21,386,"your ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and courage all the"
200,21,387,world over.”
200,21,388,"“You say truly, my dear father,” answered Telemachus, “and you shall"
200,21,389,"see, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.”"
200,21,390,"Laertes was delighted when he heard this. “Good heavens,” he exclaimed,"
200,21,391,“what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and
200,21,392,grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour.”
200,21,393,"On this Minerva came close up to him and said, “Son of Arceisius —  - best"
200,21,394,"friend I have in the world — pray to the blue - eyed damsel, and to Jove"
200,21,395,her father; then poise your spear and hurl it.”
200,21,396,"As she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed"
200,21,397,"to her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes’ helmet, and"
200,21,398,"the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his"
200,21,399,armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
200,21,400,Meantime Ulysses and his son fell upon the front line of the foe and
200,21,401,"smote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed"
200,21,402,"every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,"
200,21,403,"only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. “Men of"
200,21,404,"Ithaca,” she cried, “cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at"
200,21,405,once without further bloodshed.”
200,21,406,On this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their
200,21,407,arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of
200,21,408,"the goddess’ voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. But"
200,21,409,"Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down"
200,21,410,like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire
200,21,411,"that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses, “Ulysses,"
200,21,412,"noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will be angry"
200,21,413,with you.”
200,21,414,"Thus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed"
200,21,415,"the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace"
200,21,416,between the two contending parties.

200,21,640,"breeding horses? The most equitable translation, therefore, of the"
200,21,641,"present text being thus halt and impotent, we may suspect corruption,"
200,21,642,"and I hazard the following emendation, though I have not adopted it in"
200,21,643,"my translation, as fearing that it would be deemed too fanciful. I"
200,21,644,would read: — {Greek}.
200,21,645,"As far as scanning goes the {Greek} is not necessary; {Greek} iv. 72,"
200,21,646,"(Footnote Greek) iv. 233, to go no further afield than earlier lines of"
200,21,647,"the same book, give sufficient authority for {Greek}, but the {Greek}"
200,21,648,would not be redundant; it would emphasise the surprise of the
200,21,649,"contrast, and I should prefer to have it, though it is not very"
200,21,650,important either way. This reading of course should be translated
200,21,651,"“Ithaca is an island fit for breeding goats, and (by your leave) itself"
200,21,652,a horseman rather than fit for breeding horses — for not one of the
200,21,653,islands is good and well meadowed ground.”
200,21,654,"This would be sure to baffle the Alexandrian editors. “How,” they would"
200,21,655,"ask themselves, “could an island be a horseman?” and they would cast"
200,21,656,about for an emendation. A visit to the top of Mt. Eryx might perhaps
200,21,657,"make the meaning intelligible, and suggest my proposed restoration of"
200,21,658,the text to the reader as readily as it did to myself.
200,21,659,I have elsewhere stated my conviction that the writer of the “Odyssey”
200,21,660,"was familiar with the old Sican city at the top of Mt. Eryx, and that"
200,21,661,the Aegadean islands which are so striking when seen thence did duty
200,21,662,"with her for the Ionian islands — Marettimo, the highest and most"
200,21,663,"westerly of the group, standing for Ithaca. When seen from the top of"
200,21,664,"Mt. Eryx Marettimo shows as it should do according to “Od.” ix. 25, 26,"
200,21,665,"“on the horizon, all highest up in the sea towards the West,” while the"
200,21,666,other islands lie “some way off it to the East.” As we descend to
200,21,667,"Trapani, Marettimo appears to sink on to the top of the island of"
200,21,668,"Levanzo, behind which it disappears. My friend, the late Signor E."
200,21,669,"Biaggini, pointed to it once as it was just standing on the top of"
200,21,670,"Levanzo, and said to me “Come cavalca bene” (“How well it rides”), and"
200,21,671,this immediately suggested my emendation to me. Later on I found in the
200,21,672,hymn to the Pythian Apollo (which abounds with tags taken from the
200,21,673,“Odyssey”) a line ending {Greek} which strengthened my suspicion that
200,21,674,this was the original ending of the second of the two lines above under
200,21,675,consideration.]

200,21,802,"two contiguous islands of the Formiche, which are treated as one, see"
200,21,803,"map facing p. 108. The Asinelli is an island shaped like a boat, and"

200,21,896,quite understand her own story; her difficulty was perhaps due to the
200,21,897,fact that though Trapanese sailors had given her a fair idea as to
200,21,898,"where all her other localities really were, no one in those days more"
200,21,899,"than in our own could localise the Planctae, which in fact, as Buttmann"
200,21,900,"has argued, were derived not from any particular spot, but from"
200,21,901,sailors’ tales about the difficulties of navigating the group of the
200,21,902,Aeolian islands as a whole (see note on “Od.” x. 3). Still the matter
200,21,903,"of the poor doves caught her fancy, so she would not forgo them. The"
200,21,904,whirlwinds of fire and the smoke that hangs on Scylla suggests allusion
200,21,905,"to Stromboli and perhaps even Etna. Scylla is on the Italian side, and"
200,21,906,therefore may be said to look West. It is about 8 miles thence to the

200,21,1178,are told was in a place that could be seen from all round — or it might
200,21,1179,be simply a window in Telemachus’s room looking out into the street.
200,21,1180,From the top of the tower the outer world was to be told what was going
200,21,1181,"on, but people could not get in by the ὀρσοθύρα: they would have to"
200,21,1182,"come in by the main entrance, and Melanthius explains that the mouth of"
200,21,1183,the narrow passage (which was in the lands of Ulysses and his friends)
200,21,1184,"commanded the only entrance by which help could come, so that there"
200,21,1185,would be nothing gained by raising an alarm.
200,21,1186,"As for the ῥῶγες of line 143, no commentator ancient or modern has"
200,21,1187,"been able to say what was intended — but whatever they were,"
200,21,1188,"Melanthius could never carry twelve shields, twelve helmets, and"
200,21,1189,"twelve spears. Moreover, where he could go the others could go"
200,21,1190,also. If a dozen suitors had followed Melanthius into the house
200,21,1191,"they could have attacked Ulysses in the rear, in which case, unless"
200,21,1192,"Minerva had intervened promptly, the “Odyssey” would have had a"
200,21,1193,different ending. But throughout the scene we are in a region of
200,21,1194,extravagance rather than of true fiction — it cannot be taken
200,21,1195,"seriously by any but the very serious, until we come to the episode"
200,21,1196,"of Phemius and Medon, where the writer begins to be at home again.]"
200,21,1197,[172] [ I presume it was intended that there should be a hook driven
200,21,1198,into the bearing - post.]
200,21,1199,[173] [ What for?]
200,21,1200,[174] [ Gr: {Greek}. This is not {Greek}.]
200,21,1201,"[175] [ From lines 333 and 341 of this book, and lines 145 and 146 of"
200,21,1202,bk. xxi we can locate the approach to the {Greek} with some certainty.]
200,21,1203,[176] [ But in xix. 500 - 502 Ulysses scolded Euryclea for offering
200,21,1204,"information on this very point, and declared himself quite able to"
200,21,1205,settle it for himself.]
200,21,1206,[177] [ There were a hundred and eight Suitors.]
200,21,1207,"[178] [ Lord Grimthorpe, whose understanding does not lend itself to"
200,21,1208,"easy imposition, has been good enough to write to me about my"
200,21,1209,"conviction that the “Odyssey” was written by a woman, and to send me"
200,21,1210,remarks upon the gross absurdity of the incident here recorded. It is
200,21,1211,plain that all the authoress cared about was that the women should be
200,21,1212,"hanged: as for attempting to realise, or to make her readers realise,"
200,21,1213,"how the hanging was done, this was of no consequence. The reader must"
200,21,1214,take her word for it and ask no questions. Lord Grimthorpe wrote:
200,21,1215,“I had better send you my ideas about Nausicaa’s hanging of the maids
200,21,1216,"(not ‘maidens,’ of whom Froude wrote so well in his ‘Science of"
200,21,1217,History’) before I forget it all. Luckily for me Liddell & Scott have
200,21,1218,"specially translated most of the doubtful words, referring to this very"
200,21,1219,place.
200,21,1220,"“A ship’s cable. I don’t know how big a ship she meant, but it must"
200,21,1221,have been a very small one indeed if its ‘cable’ could be used to tie
200,21,1222,"tightly round a woman’s neck, and still more round a dozen of them ‘in"
200,21,1223,"a row,’ besides being strong enough to hold them and pull them all up."
200,21,1224,“A dozen average women would need the weight and strength of more than
200,21,1225,a dozen strong heavy men even over the best pulley hung to the roof
200,21,1226,over them; and the idea of pulling them up by a rope hung anyhow round
200,21,1227,a pillar {Greek} is absurdly impossible; and how a dozen of them could
200,21,1228,be hung dangling round one post is a problem which a senior wrangler
200,21,1229,would be puzzled to answer... She had better have let Telemachus use
200,21,1230,his sword as he had intended till she changed his mind for him.”]
200,21,1231,[179] [ Then they had all been in Ulysses’ service over twenty years;
200,21,1232,perhaps the twelve guilty ones had been engaged more recently.]
200,21,1233,[180] [ Translation very doubtful — cf. “It.” xxiv. 598.]
200,21,1234,"[181] [ But why could she not at once ask to see the scar, of which"
200,21,1235,"Euryclea had told her, or why could not Ulysses have shown it to her?]"
200,21,1236,[182] [ The people of Ithaca seem to have been as fond of carping as
200,21,1237,"the Phaeacians were in vi. 273, etc.]"
200,21,1238,[183] [ See note [156]. Ulysses’s bed room does not appear to have been
200,21,1239,"upstairs, nor yet quite within the house. Is it possible that it was"
200,21,1240,"“the domed room” round the outside of which the erring maids were, for"
200,21,1241,"aught we have heard to the contrary, still hanging?]"
200,21,1242,[184] [ Ulysses bedroom in the mind of the writer is here too
200,21,1243,apparently down stairs.]
200,21,1244,"[185] [ Penelope having been now sufficiently whitewashed, disappears"
200,21,1245,from the poem.]
200,21,1246,[186] [ So practised a washerwoman as our authoress doubtless knew that
200,21,1247,by this time the web must have become such a wreck that it would have
200,21,1248,gone to pieces in the wash.]
200,21,1249,"A lady points out to me, just as these sheets are leaving my hands,"
200,21,1250,"that no really good needlewoman — no one, indeed, whose work or character"
200,21,1251,"was worth consideration — could have endured, no matter for what reason,"
200,21,1252,"the unpicking of her day’s work, day after day for between three and"
200,21,1253,four years.]
200,21,1254,[187] [ We must suppose Dolius not yet to know that his son Melanthius
200,21,1255,"had been tortured, mutilated, and left to die by Ulysses’ orders on the"
200,21,1256,"preceding day, and that his daughter Melantho had been hanged. Dolius"
200,21,1257,"was probably exceptionally simple - minded, and his name was ironical. So"
200,21,1258,on Mt. Eryx I was shown a man who was always called Sonza Malizia or
200,21,1259,“Guileless” — he being held exceptionally cunning.]

200,21,1488,Project Gutenberg - tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
200,21,1489,electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
200,21,1490,"computers including obsolete, old, middle - aged and new computers. It"
200,21,1491,exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
200,21,1492,from people in all walks of life.
200,21,1493,Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
200,21,1494,assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg - tm's

200,21,1523,Literary Archive Foundation
200,21,1524,Project Gutenberg - tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
200,21,1525,spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
200,21,1526,increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
200,21,1527,freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
200,21,1528,array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
200,21,1529,"($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt"
200,21,1530,status with the IRS.
200,21,1531,The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
200,21,1532,charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
200,21,1533,States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
200,21,1534,"considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up"
200,21,1535,with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
200,21,1536,where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

200,21,1550,Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg - tm electronic works.
200,21,1551,Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
200,21,1552,Gutenberg - tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
200,21,1553,"freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and"
200,21,1554,distributed Project Gutenberg - tm eBooks with only a loose network of
200,21,1555,volunteer support.
200,21,1556,Project Gutenberg - tm eBooks are often created from several printed
200,21,1557,"editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in"
200,21,1558,"the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not"
200,21,1559,necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper

300,1,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,1,2,Apollo’s priest to th’ Argive fleet doth bring
300,1,3,"Gifts for his daughter, pris’ner to the king;"
300,1,4,For which her tender’d freedom he entreats;
300,1,5,"But, being dismiss’d with contumelious threats,"
300,1,6,"At Phœbus’ hands, by vengeful pray’r, he seeks"
300,1,7,To have a plague inflicted on the Greeks.
300,1,8,"Which had; Achilles doth a council cite,"
300,1,9,"Embold’ning Calchas, in the king’s despite;"
300,1,10,To tell the truth why they were punish’d so.
300,1,11,From hence their fierce and deadly strife did grow.
300,1,12,"For wrong in which Æacides so raves,"
300,1,13,"That goddess Thetis, from her throne of waves"
300,1,14,"Ascending heav’n, of Jove assistance won,"
300,1,15,"To plague the Greeks by absence of her son,"
300,1,16,And make the general himself repent
300,1,17,To wrong so much his army’s ornament.
300,1,18,"This found by Juno, she with Jove contends;"
300,1,19,"Till Vulcan, with heav’n’s cup, the quarrel ends."
300,1,20,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,1,21,Alpha the prayer of Chryses sings:
300,1,22,The army’s plague: the strife of kings.
300,1,23,"Achilles’ baneful wrath resound, O Goddess, that impos’d"
300,1,24,"Infinite sorrows on the Greeks, and many brave souls los’d."
300,1,25,From breasts heroic; sent them far to that invisible cave
300,1,26,That no light comforts; and their limbs to dogs and vultures gave;
300,1,27,To all which Jove’s will gave effect; from whom first strife begun
300,1,28,"Betwixt Atrides, king of men, and Thetis’ godlike son."
300,1,29,"What god gave Eris their command, and op’d that fighting vein?"
300,1,30,"Jove’s and Latona’s son: who fir’d against the king of men,"
300,1,31,"For contumély shown his priest, infectious sickness sent"
300,1,32,"To plague the army, and to death by troops the soldiers went."
300,1,33,"Occasion’d thus: Chryses, the priest, came to the fleet to buy,"
300,1,34,"For presents of unvalu’d price, his daughter’s liberty;"
300,1,35,The golden sceptre and the crown of Phœbus in his hands
300,1,36,"Proposing; and made suit to all, but most to the commands"
300,1,37,"Of both th’ Atrides, who most rul’d. “Great Atreus’ sons,” said he,"
300,1,38,"“And all ye well - greav’d Greeks, the gods, whose habitations be"
300,1,39,"In heav’nly houses, grace your pow’rs with Priam’s razéd town,"
300,1,40,And grant ye happy conduct home! To win which wish’d renown
300,1,41,"Of Jove, by honouring his son, far - shooting Phœbus, deign"
300,1,42,For these fit presents to dissolve the ransomable chain
300,1,43,Of my lov’d daughter’s servitude.” The Greeks entirely gave
300,1,44,"Glad acclamations, for sign that their desires would have"
300,1,45,"The grave priest reverenc’d, and his gifts of so much price embrac’d."
300,1,46,"The Gen’ral yet bore no such mind, but viciously disgrac’d"
300,1,47,"With violent terms the priest, and said: — “Dotard! avoid our fleet,"
300,1,48,Where ling’ring be not found by me; nor thy returning feet
300,1,49,"Let ever visit us again; lest nor thy godhead’s crown,"
300,1,50,"Nor sceptre, save thee! Her thou seek’st I still will hold mine own,"
300,1,51,"Till age deflow’r her. In our court at Argos, far transferr’d"
300,1,52,"From her lov’d country, she shall ply her web, and see prepar’d[1]"
300,1,53,"With all fit ornaments my bed. Incense me then no more,"
300,1,54,"But, if thou wilt be safe, be gone.” This said, the sea - beat shore,"
300,1,55,"Obeying his high will, the priest trod off with haste and fear;"
300,1,56,"And, walking silent, till he left far off his enemies’ ear,"
300,1,57,"Phœbus, fair hair’d Latona’s son, he stirr’d up with a vow,"
300,1,58,"To this stern purpose: “Hear, thou God that bear’st the silver bow,"
300,1,59,"That Chrysa guard’st, rul’st Tenedos with strong hand, and the round"
300,1,60,Of Cilia most divine dost walk! O Sminthëus! if crown’d
300,1,61,"With thankful off’rings thy rich fane I ever saw, or fir’d"
300,1,62,"Fat thighs of oxen and of goats to thee, this grace desir’d"
300,1,63,"Vouchsafe to me: pains for my tears let these rude Greeks repay,"
300,1,64,"Forc’d with thy arrows.” Thus he pray’d, and Phœebus heard him pray,"
300,1,65,"And, vex’d at heart, down from the tops of steep heav’n stoop’d; his"
300,1,66,"bow,"
300,1,67,"And quiver cover’d round, his hands did on his shoulders throw;"
300,1,68,And of the angry Deity the arrows as he mov’d
300,1,69,"Rattled about him. Like the night he rang’d the host, and rov’d"
300,1,70,(Apart the fleet set) terribly; with his hard - loosing hand
300,1,71,"His silver bow twang’d; and his shafts did first the mules command,"
300,1,72,And swift hounds; then the Greeks themselves his deadly arrows shot.
300,1,73,The fires of death went never out; nine days his shafts flew hot
300,1,74,"About the army; and the tenth, Achilles called a court"
300,1,75,"Of all the Greeks; heav’n’s white - arm’d Queen (who, ev’rywhere cut"
300,1,76,"short,"
300,1,77,"Beholding her lov’d Greeks, by death) suggested it; and he"
300,1,78,"(All met in one) arose, and said: “Atrides, now I see"
300,1,79,"We must be wandering again, flight must be still our stay,"
300,1,80,"If flight can save us now, at once sickness and battle lay"
300,1,81,"Such strong hand on us. Let us ask some prophet, priest, or prove"
300,1,82,Some dream - interpreter (for dreams are often sent from Jove)
300,1,83,Why Phœbus is so much incens’d; if unperformed vows
300,1,84,"He blames in us, or hecatombs; and if these knees he bows"
300,1,85,"To death may yield his graves no more, but off’ring all supply"
300,1,86,"Of savours burnt from lambs and goats, avert his fervent eye,"
300,1,87,"And turn his temp’rate.” Thus, he sat; and then stood up to them"
300,1,88,"Calchas, surnam’d Thestorides, of augurs the supreme;"
300,1,89,"He knew things present, past, to come, and rul’d the equipage"
300,1,90,"Of th’ Argive fleet to Ilion, for his prophetic rage"
300,1,91,"Giv’n by Apollo; who, well - seen in th’ ill they felt, propos’d"
300,1,92,"This to Achilles: “Jove’s belov’d, would thy charge see disclos’d"
300,1,93,The secret of Apollo’s wrath? then cov’nant and take oath
300,1,94,"To my discov’ry, that, with words and pow’rful actions both,"
300,1,95,Thy strength will guard the truth in me; because I well conceive
300,1,96,"That he whose empire governs all, whom all the Grecians give"
300,1,97,"Confirm’d obedience, will be mov’d; and then you know the state"
300,1,98,Of him that moves him. When a king hath once mark’d for his hate
300,1,99,"A man inferior, though that day his wrath seems to digest"
300,1,100,"Th’ offence he takes, yet evermore he rakes up in his breast"
300,1,101,"Brands of quick anger, till revenge hath quench’d to his desire"
300,1,102,"The fire reservéd. Tell me, then, if, whatsoever ire"
300,1,103,"Suggests in hurt of me to him, thy valour will prevent?”"
300,1,104,"Achilles answer’d: “All thou know’st speak, and be confident;"
300,1,105,"For by Apollo, Jove’s belov’d, (to whom performing vows,"
300,1,106,"O Calchas, for the state of Greece, thy spirit prophetic shows"
300,1,107,"Skills that direct us) not a man of all these Grecians here,"
300,1,108,"I living, and enjoy’ng the light shot through this flow’ry sphere,"
300,1,109,Shall touch thee with offensive hands; though Agamemnon be
300,1,110,"The man in question, that doth boast the mightiest empery"
300,1,111,"Of all our army.” Then took heart the prophet unreprov’d,"
300,1,112,"And said: “They are not unpaid vows, nor hecatombs, that mov’d"
300,1,113,The God against us; his offence is for his priest impair’d
300,1,114,"By Agamemnon, that refus’d the present he preferr’d,"
300,1,115,And kept his daughter. This is cause why heav’n’s Far - darter darts
300,1,116,These plagues amongst us; and this still will empty in our hearts
300,1,117,"His deathful quiver, uncontain’d till to her lovéd sire"
300,1,118,The black - eyed damsel be resign’d; no rédemptory hire
300,1,119,"Took for her freedom, - not a gift, but all the ransom quit,"
300,1,120,"And she convey’d, with sacrifice, till her enfranchis’d feet"
300,1,121,"Tread Chrysa under; then the God, so pleas’d, perhaps we may"
300,1,122,"Move to remission.” Thus, he sate; and up, the great in sway,"
300,1,123,"Heroic Agamemnon rose, eagérly bearing all;"
300,1,124,His mind’s seat overcast with fumes; an anger general
300,1,125,"Fill’d all his faculties; his eyes sparkled like kindling fire,"
300,1,126,"Which sternly cast upon the priest, thus vented he his ire:"
300,1,127,“Prophet of ill! for never good came from thee towards me
300,1,128,Not to a word’s worth; evermore thou took’st delight to be
300,1,129,"Offensive in thy auguries, which thou continu’st still,"
300,1,130,"Now casting thy prophetic gall, and vouching all our ill,"
300,1,131,"Shot from Apollo, is impos’d since I refus’d the price"
300,1,132,Of fair Chryseis’ liberty; which would in no worth rise
300,1,133,"To my rate of herself, which moves my vows to have her home,"
300,1,134,"Past Clytemnestra loving her, that grac’d my nuptial room"
300,1,135,With her virginity and flow’r. Nor ask her merits less
300,1,136,"For person, disposition, wit, and skill in housewif’ries."
300,1,137,"And yet, for all this, she shall go, if more conducible"
300,1,138,That course be than her holding here. I rather wish the weal
300,1,139,Of my lov’d army than the death. Provide yet instantly
300,1,140,"Supply for her, that I alone of all our royalty"
300,1,141,Lose not my winnings. ’Tis not fit. Ye see all I lose mine
300,1,142,"Forc’d by another, see as well some other may resign"
300,1,143,"His prise to me.” To this replied the swift - foot, god - like, son"
300,1,144,"Of Thetis, thus: “King of us all, in all ambition"
300,1,145,"Most covetous of all that breathe, why should the great - soul’d Greeks"
300,1,146,Supply thy lost prise out of theirs? Nor what thy av’rice seeks
300,1,147,Our common treasury can find; so little it doth guard
300,1,148,"Of what our ras’d towns yielded us; of all which most is shar’d,"
300,1,149,And giv’n our soldiers; which again to take into our hands
300,1,150,"Were ignominious and base. Now then, since God commands,"
300,1,151,Part with thy most - lov’d prise to him; not any one of us
300,1,152,"Exacts it of thee, yet we all, all loss thou suffer’st thus,"
300,1,153,"Will treble, quadruple, in gain, when Jupiter bestows"
300,1,154,The sack of well - wall’d Troy on us; which by his word he owes.”
300,1,155,"“Do not deceive yourself with wit,” he answer’d, “god - like man,"
300,1,156,Though your good name may colour it; ’tis not your swift foot can
300,1,157,"Outrun me here; nor shall the gloss, set on it with the God,"
300,1,158,Persuade me to my wrong. Wouldst thou maintain in sure abode
300,1,159,"Thine own prise, and slight me of mine? Resolve this: if our friends,"
300,1,160,"As fits in equity my worth, will right me with amends,"
300,1,161,"So rest it; otherwise, myself will enter personally"
300,1,162,"On thy prise, that of Ithacus, or Ajax, for supply;"
300,1,163,"Let him on whom I enter rage. But come, we’ll order these"
300,1,164,"Hereafter, and in other place. Now put to sacred seas"
300,1,165,"Our black sail; in it rowers put, in it fit sacrifice;"
300,1,166,"And to these I will make ascend my so much envied prise,"
300,1,167,"Bright - cheek’d Chryseis. For conduct of all which, we must choose"
300,1,168,"A chief out of our counsellors. Thy service we must use,"
300,1,169,"Idomenëus; Ajax, thine; or thine, wise Ithacus;"
300,1,170,"Or thine, thou terriblest of men, thou son of Peleüs,"
300,1,171,"Which fittest were, that thou might’st see these holy acts perform’d"
300,1,172,"For which thy cunning zeal so pleads; and he, whose bow thus storm’d"
300,1,173,"For our offences, may be calm’d.” Achilles, with a frown,"
300,1,174,Thus answer’d: “O thou impudent! of no good but thine own
300,1,175,"Ever respectful, but of that with all craft covetous,"
300,1,176,"With what heart can a man attempt a service dangerous,"
300,1,177,"Or at thy voice be spirited to fly upon a foe,"
300,1,178,"Thy mind thus wretched? For myself, I was not injur’d so"
300,1,179,"By any Trojan, that my pow’rs should bid them any blows;"
300,1,180,"In nothing bear they blame of me; Phthia, whose bosom flows"
300,1,181,"With corn and people, never felt impair of her increase"
300,1,182,"By their invasion; hills enow, and far - resounding seas,"
300,1,183,"Pour out their shades and deeps between; but thee, thou frontless man,"
300,1,184,"We follow, and thy triumphs make with bonfires of our bane;"
300,1,185,"Thine, and thy brother’s, vengeance sought, thou dog’s eyes, of  this"
300,1,186,Troy
300,1,187,By our expos’d lives; whose deserts thou neither dost employ
300,1,188,"With honour nor with care. And now, thou threat’st to force from me"
300,1,189,"The fruit of my sweat, which the Greeks gave all; and though it be,"
300,1,190,"Compar’d with thy part, then snatch’d up, nothing; nor ever is"
300,1,191,"At any sack’d town; but of fight, the fetcher in of this,"
300,1,192,My hands have most share; in whose toils when I have emptied me
300,1,193,"Of all my forces, my amends in liberality,"
300,1,194,"Though it be little, I accept, and turn pleas’d to my tent;"
300,1,195,And yet that little thou esteem’st too great a continent
300,1,196,In thy incontinent avarice. For Phthia therefore now
300,1,197,"My course is; since ’tis better far, than here t’ endure that thou"
300,1,198,"Should’st still be ravishing my right, draw my whole treasure dry,"
300,1,199,"And add dishonour.” He replied: “If thy heart serve thee, fly;"
300,1,200,Stay not for my cause; others here will aid and honour me;
300,1,201,"If not, yet Jove I know is sure; that counsellor is he"
300,1,202,"That I depend on. As for thee, of all our Jove - kept kings"
300,1,203,"Thou still art most my enemy; strifes, battles, bloody things,"
300,1,204,"Make thy blood - feasts still. But if strength, that these moods build"
300,1,205,"upon,"
300,1,206,"Flow in thy nerves, God gave thee it; and so ’tis not thine own,"
300,1,207,But in his hands still. What then lifts thy pride in this so high?
300,1,208,"Home with thy fleet, and Myrmidons; use there their empery;"
300,1,209,"Command not here. I weigh thee not, nor mean to magnify"
300,1,210,"Thy rough - hewn rages, but, instead, I thus far threaten thee:"
300,1,211,"Since Phœbus needs will force from me Chryseis, she shall go;"
300,1,212,My ships and friends shall waft her home; but I will imitate so
300,1,213,"His pleasure, that mine own shall take, in person, from thy tent"
300,1,214,Bright - cheek’d Briseis; and so tell thy strength how eminent
300,1,215,"My pow’r is, being compar’d with thine; all other making fear"
300,1,216,"To vaunt equality with me, or in this proud kind bear"
300,1,217,"Their beards against me.” Thetis’ son at this stood vex’d, his heart"
300,1,218,"Bristled his bosom, and two ways drew his discursive part;"
300,1,219,"If, from his thigh his sharp sword drawn, he should make room about"
300,1,220,"Atrides’ person, slaught’ring him, or sit his anger out,"
300,1,221,And curb his spirit. While these thoughts striv’d in his blood and
300,1,222,"mind,"
300,1,223,"And he his sword drew, down from heav’n Athenia stoop’d, and shin’d"
300,1,224,"About his temples, being sent by th’ ivory - wristed Queen,"
300,1,225,"Saturnia, who out of her heart had ever loving been,"
300,1,226,"And careful for the good of both. She stood behind, and took"
300,1,227,"Achilles by the yellow curls, and only gave her look"
300,1,228,To him appearance; not a man of all the rest could see.
300,1,229,"He turning back his eye, amaze strook every faculty;"
300,1,230,"Yet straight he knew her by her eyes, so terrible they were,"
300,1,231,"Sparkling with ardour, and thus spake: “Thou seed of Jupiter,"
300,1,232,"Why com’st thou? To behold his pride, that boasts our empery?"
300,1,233,"Then witness with it my revenge, and see that insolence die"
300,1,234,That lives to wrong me.” She replied: “I come from heav’n to see
300,1,235,"Thy anger settled, if thy soul will use her sov’reignty"
300,1,236,"In fit reflection. I am sent from Juno, whose affects"
300,1,237,"Stand heartily inclin’d to both. Come, give us both respects,"
300,1,238,"And cease contention; draw no sword; use words, and such as may"
300,1,239,"Be bitter to his pride, but just; for, trust in what I say,"
300,1,240,"A time shall come, when, thrice the worth of that he forceth now,"
300,1,241,He shall propose for recompense of these wrongs; therefore throw
300,1,242,"Reins on thy passions, and serve us.” He answer’d “Though my heart"
300,1,243,"Burn in just anger, yet my soul must conquer th’ angry part,"
300,1,244,"And yield you conquest. Who subdues his earthly part for heav’n,"
300,1,245,"Heav’n to his pray’rs subdues his wish.” This said, her charge was"
300,1,246,given
300,1,247,"Fit honour; in his silver hilt he held his able hand,"
300,1,248,And forc’d his broad sword up; and up to heav’n did re - ascend
300,1,249,"Minerva, who, in Jove’s high roof that bears the rough shield, took"
300,1,250,"Her place with other deities. She gone, again forsook"
300,1,251,"Patience his passion, and no more his silence could confine"
300,1,252,"His wrath, that this broad language gave: “Thou ever steep’d in wine,"
300,1,253,"Dog’s face, with heart but of a hart, that nor in th’ open eye"
300,1,254,"Of fight dar’st thrust into a prease, nor with our noblest lie"
300,1,255,In secret ambush! These works seem too full of death for thee;
300,1,256,’Tis safer far in the open host to dare an injury
300,1,257,To any crosser of thy lust. Thou subject - eating king!
300,1,258,"Base spirits thou govern’st, or this wrong had been the last foul thing"
300,1,259,"Thou ever author’dst; yet I vow, and by a great oath swear,"
300,1,260,"Ev’n by this sceptre, that, as this never again shall bear[2]"
300,1,261,"Green leaves or branches, nor increase with any growth his size,"
300,1,262,"Nor did since first it left the hills, and had his faculties"
300,1,263,And ornaments bereft with iron; which now to other end
300,1,264,"Judges of Greece bear, and their laws, receiv’d from Jove, defend;"
300,1,265,"(For which my oath to thee is great); so, whensoever need"
300,1,266,"Shall burn with thirst of me thy host, no pray’rs shall ever breed"
300,1,267,"Affection in me to their aid, though well - deserved woes"
300,1,268,"Afflict thee for them, when to death man - slaught’ring Hector throws"
300,1,269,"Whole troops of them, and thou torment’st thy vex’d mind with conceit"
300,1,270,"Of thy rude rage now, and his wrong that most deserv’d the right"
300,1,271,"Of all thy army.” Thus, he threw his sceptre ’gainst the ground,"
300,1,272,"With golden studs stuck, and took seat. Atrides’ breast was drown’d"
300,1,273,"In rising choler. Up to both sweet - spoken Nestor stood,"
300,1,274,"The cunning Pylian orator, whose tongue pour’d forth a flood"
300,1,275,Of more - than - honey - sweet discourse; two ages were increas’d
300,1,276,"Of divers - languag’d men, all born in his time and deceas’d,"
300,1,277,"In sacred Pylos, where he reign’d amongst the third - ag’d men"
300,1,278,"He, well - seen in the world, advis’d, and thus express’d it then:"
300,1,279,"“O Gods! Our Greek earth will be drown’d in just tears; rapeful Troy,"
300,1,280,"Her king, and all his sons, will make as just a mock, and joy,"
300,1,281,"Of these disjunctions; if of you, that all our host excel"
300,1,282,"In counsel and in skill of fight, they hear this. Come, repel"
300,1,283,"These young men’s passions. Y’ are not both, put both your years in"
300,1,284,"one,"
300,1,285,"So old as I. I liv’d long since, and was companion"
300,1,286,"With men superior to you both, who yet would ever hear"
300,1,287,"My counsels with respect. My eyes yet never witness were,"
300,1,288,"Nor ever will be, of such men as then delighted them;"
300,1,289,"Pirithous, Exadius, and god - like Polypheme,"
300,1,290,"Cæneus, and Dryas prince of men, Ægean Theseüs,"
300,1,291,"A man like heav’n’s immortals form’d; all, all most vigorous,"
300,1,292,"Of all men that ev’n those days: bred; most vig’rous men, and fought"
300,1,293,"With beasts most vig’rous, mountain beasts, (for men in strength were"
300,1,294,nought
300,1,295,"Match’d with their forces) fought with them, and bravely fought them"
300,1,296,down
300,1,297,"Yet ev’n with these men I convers’d, being call’d to the renown"
300,1,298,"Of their societies, by their suits, from Pylos far, to fight"
300,1,299,"In th’ Apian kingdom; and I fought, to a degree of might"
300,1,300,"That help’d ev’n their mights, against such as no man now would  dare"
300,1,301,"To meet in conflict; yet ev’n these my counsels still would hear,"
300,1,302,And with obedience crown my words. Give you such palm to them;
300,1,303,"’Tis better than to wreath your wraths. Atrides, give not stream"
300,1,304,"To all thy pow’r, nor force his prise, but yield her still his own,"
300,1,305,"As all men else do. Nor do thou encounter with thy crown,"
300,1,306,"Great son of Peleus, since no king that ever Jove allow’d"
300,1,307,Grace of a sceptre equals him. Suppose thy nerves endow’d
300,1,308,"With strength superior, and thy birth a very goddess gave,"
300,1,309,"Yet he of force is mightier, since what his own nerves have"
300,1,310,"Is amplified with just command of many other. King of men,"
300,1,311,Command thou then thyself; and I with my pray’rs will obtain
300,1,312,Grace of Achilles to subdue his fury; whose parts are
300,1,313,"Worth our entreaty, being chief check to all our ill in war.”"
300,1,314,"“All this, good father,” said the king, “is comely and good right;"
300,1,315,"But this man breaks all such bounds; he affects, past all men, height;"
300,1,316,"All would in his pow’r hold, all make his subjects, give to all"
300,1,317,His hot will for their temp’rate law; all which he never shall
300,1,318,Persuade at my hands. If the gods have giv’n him the great style
300,1,319,"Of ablest soldier, made they that his licence to revile"
300,1,320,"Men with vile language?” Thetis’ son prevented him, and said:"
300,1,321,"“Fearful and vile I might be thought, if the exactions laid"
300,1,322,"By all means on me I should bear. Others command to this,"
300,1,323,"Thou shalt not me; or if thou dost, far my free spirit is"
300,1,324,"From serving thy command. Beside, this I affirm (afford"
300,1,325,Impression of it in thy soul): will not use my sword
300,1,326,"On thee or any for a wench, unjustly though thou tak’st"
300,1,327,"The thing thou gav’st; but all things else, that in my ship thou mak’st"
300,1,328,"Greedy survey of, do not touch without my leave; or do, —"
300,1,329,"Add that act’s wrong to this, that these may see that outrage too, —"
300,1,330,"And then comes my part; then be sure, thy blood upon my lance"
300,1,331,Shall flow in vengeance.” These high terms these two at variance
300,1,332,Us’d to each other; left their seats; and after them arose
300,1,333,"The whole court. To his tents and ships, with friends and soldiers,"
300,1,334,goes
300,1,335,"Angry Achilles. Atreus’ son the swift ship launch’d, and put"
300,1,336,"Within it twenty chosen row’rs, within it likewise shut"
300,1,337,The hecatomb t’ appease the God; then caus’d to come aboard
300,1,338,"Fair - cheek’d Chryseis; for the chief, he in whom Pallas pour’d"
300,1,339,"Her store of counsels, Ithacus, aboard went last; and then"
300,1,340,The moist ways of the sea they sail’d. And now the king of men
300,1,341,"Bade all the host to sacrifice. They sacrific’d, and cast"
300,1,342,The offal of all to the deeps; the angry God they grac’d
300,1,343,"With perfect hecatombs; some bulls, some goats, along the shore"
300,1,344,"Of the unfruitful sea, inflam’d. To heav’n the thick fumes bore"
300,1,345,"Enwrapped savours. Thus, though all the politic king made shew"
300,1,346,"Respects to heav’n, yet he himself all that time did pursue"
300,1,347,"His own affections; the late jar, in which he thunder’d threats"
300,1,348,"Against Achilles, still he fed, and his affections’ heats"
300,1,349,"Thus vented to Talthybius, and grave Eurybates,"
300,1,350,"Heralds, and ministers of trust, to all his messages."
300,1,351,"“Haste to Achilles’ tent; where take Briseis’ hand, and bring"
300,1,352,"Her beauties to us. If he fail to yield her, say your king"
300,1,353,"Will come himself, with multitudes that shall the horribler"
300,1,354,"Make both his presence, and your charge, that so he dares defer.”"
300,1,355,"This said, he sent them with a charge of hard condition."
300,1,356,"They went unwillingly, and trod the fruitless sea’s shore; soon"
300,1,357,"They reach’d the navy and the tents, in which the quarter lay"
300,1,358,"Of all the Myrmidons, and found the chief Chief in their sway"
300,1,359,Set at his black bark in his tent. Nor was Achilles glad
300,1,360,To see their presence; nor themselves in any glory had
300,1,361,"Their message, but with rev’rence stocd, and fear’d th’ offended king,"
300,1,362,"Ask’d not the dame, nor spake a word. He yet, well knowing the thing"
300,1,363,"That caus’d their coming, grac’d them thus: “Heralds, ye men that bear"
300,1,364,"The messages of men and gods, y’ are welcome, come ye near."
300,1,365,"I nothing blame you, but your king; ’tis he I know doth send"
300,1,366,"You for Briseis; she is his. Patroclus, honour’d friend,"
300,1,367,"Bring forth the damsel, and these men let lead her to their lord."
300,1,368,"But, heralds, be you witnesses, before the most ador’d,"
300,1,369,"Before us mortals, and before your most ungentle king,"
300,1,370,"Of what I suffer, that, if war ever hereafter bring"
300,1,371,"My aid in question, to avert any severest bane"
300,1,372,"It brings on others, I am ’scus’d to keep mine aid in wane,"
300,1,373,"Since they mine honour. But your king, in tempting mischief, raves,"
300,1,374,Nor sees at once by present things the future; how like waves
300,1,375,Ills follow ills; injustices being never so secure
300,1,376,"In present times, but after - plagues ev’n then are seen as sure;"
300,1,377,"Which yet he sees not, and so soothes his present lust, which, check’d,"
300,1,378,"Would check plagues future; and he might, in succouring right, protect"
300,1,379,"Such as fight for his right at fleet. They still in safety fight,"
300,1,380,"That fight still justly.” This speech us’d, Patroclus did the rite"
300,1,381,"His friend commanded, and brought forth Briseis from her tent,"
300,1,382,"Gave her the heralds, and away to th’ Achive ships they went."
300,1,383,"She sad, and scarce for grief could go. Her love all friends forsook,"
300,1,384,And wept for anger. To the shore of th’ old sea he betook
300,1,385,"Himself alone, and casting forth upon the purple sea"
300,1,386,"His wet eyes, and his hands to heav’n advancing, this sad plea"
300,1,387,Made to his mother; “Mother! Since you brought me forth to breathe
300,1,388,"So short a life, Olympius had good right to bequeath"
300,1,389,"My short life honour; yet that right he doth in no degree,"
300,1,390,"But lets Atrides do me shame, and force that prise from me"
300,1,391,"That all the Greeks gave.” This with tears he utter’d, and she heard,"
300,1,392,"Set with her old sire in his deeps, and instantly appear’d"
300,1,393,"Up from the grey sea like a cloud, sate by his side, and said:"
300,1,394,“Why weeps my son? What grieves thee?
300,1,395,"Speak, conceal not what hath laid"
300,1,396,"Such hard hand on thee, let both know.” He, sighing like a storm,"
300,1,397,Replied: “Thou dost know. Why should I things known again inform?
300,1,398,"We march’d to Thebes, the sacred town of king Eëtion,"
300,1,399,"Sack’d it, and brought to fleet the spoil, which every valiant son"
300,1,400,Of Greece indifferently shar’d. Atrides had for share
300,1,401,"Fair - cheek’d Chryseis. After which, his priest that shoots so far,"
300,1,402,"Chryses, the fair Chryseis’ sire, arriv’d at th’ Achive fleet,"
300,1,403,"With infinite ransom, to redeem the dear imprison’d feet"
300,1,404,"Of his fair daughter. In his hands he held Apollo’s crown,"
300,1,405,"And golden sceptre; making suit to ev’ry Grecian son,"
300,1,406,"But most the sons of Atreüs, the others’ orderers,"
300,1,407,Yet they least heard him; all the rest receiv’d with rev’rend ears
300,1,408,"The motion, both the priest and gifts gracing, and holding worth"
300,1,409,His wish’d acceptance. Atreus’ son yet (vex’d) commanded forth
300,1,410,"With rude terms Phœbus’ rev’rend priest; who, angry, made retreat,"
300,1,411,"And pray’d to Phœbus, in whose grace he standing passing great"
300,1,412,Got his petitión. The God an ill shaft sent abroad
300,1,413,That tumbled down the Greeks in heaps. The host had no abode
300,1,414,That was not visited. We ask’d a prophet that well knew
300,1,415,"The cause of all; and from his lips Apollo’s prophecies flew,"
300,1,416,Telling his anger. First myself exhorted to appease
300,1,417,"The anger’d God; which Atreus’ son did at the heart displease,"
300,1,418,"And up he stood, us’d threats, perform’d. The black - eyed Greeks sent"
300,1,419,home
300,1,420,"Chryseis to her sire, and gave his God a hecatomb."
300,1,421,"Then, for Briseis, to my tents Atrides’ heralds came,"
300,1,422,And took her that the Greeks gave all. If then thy pow’rs can frame
300,1,423,"Wreak for thy son, afford it. Scale Olympus, and implore"
300,1,424,"Jove (if by either word, or fact, thou ever didst restore"
300,1,425,"Joy to his griev’d heart) now to help. I oft have heard thee vaunt,"
300,1,426,"In court of Peleus, that alone thy hand was conversant"
300,1,427,"In rescue from a cruel spoil the black - cloud - gath’ring Jove,"
300,1,428,Whom other Godheads would have bound (the Pow’r whose pace doth move
300,1,429,"The round earth, heav’n’s great Queen, and Pallas); to whose bands"
300,1,430,"Thou cam’st with rescue, bringing up him with the hundred hands"
300,1,431,"To great Olympus, whom the Gods call Briarëus, men"
300,1,432,"Ægæon, who his sire surpass’d, and was as strong again,"
300,1,433,And in that grace sat glad by Jove. Th’ immortals stood dismay’d
300,1,434,"At his ascension, and gave free passage to his aid."
300,1,435,"Of all this tell Jove; kneel to him, embrace his knee, and pray,"
300,1,436,"If Troy’s aid he will ever deign, that now their forces may"
300,1,437,Beat home the Greeks to fleet and sea; embruing their retreat
300,1,438,In slaughter; their pains pay’ng the wreak of their proud sov’reign’s
300,1,439,heat;
300,1,440,"And that far - ruling king may know, from his poor soldier’s harms"
300,1,441,"His own harm falls; his own and all in mine, his best in arms.”"
300,1,442,"Her answer she pour’d out in tears: “O me, my son,” said she,"
300,1,443,"“Why brought I up thy being at all, that brought thee forth to be"
300,1,444,"Sad subject of so hard a fate? O would to heav’n, that since"
300,1,445,"Thy fate is little, and not long, thou might’st without offence"
300,1,446,"And tears perform it! But to live, thrall to so stern a fate"
300,1,447,"As grants thee least life, and that least so most unfortunate,"
300,1,448,"Grieves me t’ have giv’n thee any life. But what thou wishest now,"
300,1,449,"If Jove will grant, I’ll up and ask; Olympus crown’d with snow"
300,1,450,"I’ll climb; but sit thou fast at fleet, renounce all war, and feed"
300,1,451,"Thy heart with wrath, and hope of wreak; till which come, thou shalt"
300,1,452,need
300,1,453,A little patience. Jupiter went yesterday to feast
300,1,454,"Amongst the blameless Æthiops, in th’ ocean’s deepen’d breast,"
300,1,455,"All Gods attending him; the twelfth, high heav’n again he sees,"
300,1,456,"And then his brass - paved court I’ll scale, cling to his pow’rful knees,"
300,1,457,"And doubt not but to win thy wish.” Thus, made she her remove,"
300,1,458,"And left wrath tyring on her son, for his enforcèd love."
300,1,459,"Ulysses, with the hecatomb, arriv’d at Chrysa’s shore;"
300,1,460,"And when amidst the hav’n’s deep mouth, they came to use the oar,"
300,1,461,"They straight strook sail, then roll’d them up, and on the hatches"
300,1,462,threw;
300,1,463,"The top - mast to the kelsine then, with halyards down they drew;"
300,1,464,Then brought the ship to port with oars; then forked anchor cast;
300,1,465,"And, ’gainst the violence of storm, for drifting made her fast."
300,1,466,"All come ashore, they all expos’d the holy hecatomb"
300,1,467,"To angry Phœbus, and, with it, Chryseis welcom’d home;"
300,1,468,"Whom to her sire, wise Ithacus, that did at th’ altar stand,"
300,1,469,"For honour led, and, spoken thus, resign’d her to his hand:"
300,1,470,"“Chryses, the mighty king of men, great Agamemnon, sends"
300,1,471,Thy lov’d seed by my hands to thine; and to thy God commends
300,1,472,"A hecatomb, which my charge is to sacrifice, and seek"
300,1,473,"Our much - sigh - mix’d woe his recure, invok’d by ev’ry Greek.”"
300,1,474,"Thus he resign’d her, and her sire receiv’d her highly joy’d."
300,1,475,"About the well - built altar, then, they orderly employ’d"
300,1,476,"The sacred off’ring, wash’d their hands, took salt cakes; and the"
300,1,477,"priest,"
300,1,478,"With hands held up to heav’n, thus pray’d: “O thou that all things"
300,1,479,"seest,"
300,1,480,"Fautour of Chrysa, whose fair hand doth guard fully dispose"
300,1,481,"Celestial Cilia, governing in all pow’r Tenedos,"
300,1,482,"O hear thy priest, and as thy hand, in free grace to my pray’rs,"
300,1,483,"Shot fervent plague - shafts through the Greeks, now hearten their"
300,1,484,affairs
300,1,485,"With health renew’d, and quite remove th’ infection from their blood.”"
300,1,486,He pray’d; and to his pray’rs again the God propitious stood.
300,1,487,"All, after pray’r, cast on salt cakes, drew back, kill’d, flay’d the"
300,1,488,"beeves,"
300,1,489,"Cut out and dubb’d with fat their thighs, fair dress’d with doubled"
300,1,490,"leaves,"
300,1,491,"And on them all the sweetbreads’ prick’d, The priest, with small  sere"
300,1,492,"wood,"
300,1,493,"Did sacrifice, pour’d on red wine; by whom the young men stood,"
300,1,494,"And turn’d, in five ranks, spits; on which (the legs enough) they eat"
300,1,495,"The inwards; then in giggots cut the other fit for meat,"
300,1,496,"And put to fire; which roasted well they drew. The labour done,"
300,1,497,"They serv’d the feast in, that fed all to satisfaction."
300,1,498,"Desire of meat and wine thus quench’d, the youths crown’d cups of wine"
300,1,499,"Drunk off, and fill’d again to all. That day was held divine,"
300,1,500,"And spent in pæans to the Sun, who heard with pleaséd ear;"
300,1,501,"When whose bright chariot stoop’d to sea, and twilight hid the clear,"
300,1,502,"All soundly on their cables slept, ev’n till the night was worn."
300,1,503,"And when the lady of the light, the rosy - finger’d Morn,"
300,1,504,"Rose from the hills, all fresh arose, and to the camp retir’d."
300,1,505,Apollo with a fore - right wind their swelling bark inspir’d.
300,1,506,"The top - mast hoisted, milk - white sails on his round breast they put,"
300,1,507,"The mizens strooted with the gale, the ship her course did cut"
300,1,508,So swiftly that the parted waves against her ribs did roar;
300,1,509,"Which, coming to the camp, they drew aloft the sandy shore,"
300,1,510,"Where, laid on stocks, each soldier kept his quarter as before."
300,1,511,"But Peleus’ son, swift - foot Achilles, at his swift ships sate,"
300,1,512,"Burning in wrath, nor ever came to councils of estate"
300,1,513,"That make men honour’d, never trod the fierce embattled field,"
300,1,514,"But kept close, and his lov’d heart pin’d, what fight and cries could"
300,1,515,yield
300,1,516,"Thirsting at all parts to the host, And now, since first he told"
300,1,517,"His wrongs to Thetis, twelve fair morns their ensigns did unfold,"
300,1,518,"And then the ever - living gods mounted Olympus, Jove"
300,1,519,"First in ascension. Thetis then, remember’d well to move"
300,1,520,"Achilles’ motion, rose from sea, and, by the morn’s first light,"
300,1,521,"The great heav’n and Olympus climb’d; where, in supremest height"
300,1,522,"Of all that many - headed hill, she saw the far - seen son"
300,1,523,"Of Saturn, set from all the rest, in his free seat alone."
300,1,524,"Before whom, on her own knees fall’n, the knees of Jupiter"
300,1,525,"Her left hand held, her right his chin, and thus she did prefer"
300,1,526,Her son’s petition: “Father Jove! If ever I have stood
300,1,527,"Aidful to thee in word or work, with this imploréd good,"
300,1,528,"Requite my aid, renown my son, since in so short a race"
300,1,529,(Past others) thou confin’st his life. An insolent disgrace
300,1,530,Is done him by the king of men; he forc’d from him a prise
300,1,531,"Won with his sword. But thou, O Jove, that art most strong, most wise,"
300,1,532,Honour my son for my sake; add strength to the Trojans’ side
300,1,533,By his side’s weakness in his want; and see Troy amplified
300,1,534,"In conquest, so much, and so long, till Greece may give again"
300,1,535,"The glory reft him, and the more illustrate the free reign"
300,1,536,Of his wrong’d honour.” Jove at this sate silent; not a word
300,1,537,"In long space pass’d him. Thetis still hung on his knee, implor’d"
300,1,538,"The second time his help, and said: “Grant, or deny my suit,"
300,1,539,"Be free in what thou dost; I know, thou canst not sit thus mute"
300,1,540,"For fear of any; speak, deny, that so I may be sure,"
300,1,541,"Of all heav’n’s Goddesses ’tis I, that only must endure"
300,1,542,"Dishonour by thee.” Jupiter, the great cloud - gath’rer, griev’d"
300,1,543,"With thought of what a world of griefs this suit ask’d, being achiev’d,"
300,1,544,"Swell’d, sigh’d, and answer’d: “Works of death thou urgest. O, at this"
300,1,545,"Juno will storm, and all my pow’rs inflame with contumelies."
300,1,546,"Ever she wrangles, charging me in ear of all the Gods"
300,1,547,"That I am partial still, that I add the displeasing odds"
300,1,548,"Of my aid to the Ilians. Begone then, lest she see;"
300,1,549,"Leave thy request to my care; yet, that trust may hearten thee"
300,1,550,"With thy desire’s grant, and my pow’r to give it act approve"
300,1,551,"How vain her strife is, to thy pray’r my eminent head shall move;"
300,1,552,Which is the great sign of my will with all th’ immortal states;
300,1,553,Irrevocable; never fails; never without the rates
300,1,554,"Of all pow’rs else; when my head bows, all heads bow with it still"
300,1,555,As their first mover; and gives pow’r to any work I will.”
300,1,556,He said; and his black eyebrows bent; above his deathless head
300,1,557,"Th’ ambrosian curls flow’d; great heav’n shook: and both were severéd,"
300,1,558,Their counsels broken. To the depth of Neptune’s kingdom div’d
300,1,559,Thetis from heav’n’s height; Jove arose; and all the Gods receiv’d
300,1,560,"(All rising from their thrones) their Sire, attending to his court."
300,1,561,"None sate when he rose, none delay’d the furnishing his port"
300,1,562,"Till he came near; all met with him, and brought him to his throne."
300,1,563,"Nor sate great Juno ignorant, when she beheld alone"
300,1,564,"Old Nereus’ silver - footed seed with Jove, that she had brought"
300,1,565,"Counsels to heav’n; and straight her tongue had teeth in it, that"
300,1,566,wrought
300,1,567,This sharp invective: “Who was that (thou craftiest counsellor
300,1,568,Of all the Gods) that so apart some secret did implore?
300,1,569,"Ever, apart from me, thou lov’st to counsel and decree"
300,1,570,Things of more close trust than thou think’st are fit t’ impart to me.
300,1,571,"Whatever thou determin’st, I must ever be denied"
300,1,572,The knowledge of it by thy will.” To her speech thus replied
300,1,573,The Father both of men and Gods: “Have never hope to know
300,1,574,"My whole intentions, though my wife; it fits not, nor would show"
300,1,575,"Well to thine own thoughts; but what fits thy woman’s ear to hear,"
300,1,576,"Woman, nor man, nor God, shall know before it grace thine ear."
300,1,577,"Yet what, apart from men and Gods, I please to know, forbear"
300,1,578,"T’ examine, or inquire of that.” She with the cow’s fair eyes,"
300,1,579,"Respected Juno, this return’d: “Austere king of the skies,"
300,1,580,"What hast thou utter’d? When did I before this time inquire,"
300,1,581,Or sift thy counsels? Passing close you are still. Your desire
300,1,582,"Is serv’d with such care, that I fear you can scarce vouch the deed"
300,1,583,"That makes it public, being seduc’d by this old sea - god’s seed,"
300,1,584,"That could so early use her knees, embracing thine. I doubt,"
300,1,585,The late act of thy bowéd head was for the working out
300,1,586,Of some boon she ask’d; that her son thy partial hand would please
300,1,587,"With plaguing others.” “Wretch!” said he, “thy subtle jealousies"
300,1,588,"Are still exploring; my designs can never ’scape thine eye,"
300,1,589,Which yet thou never canst prevent. Thy curiosity
300,1,590,"Makes thee less car’d for at my hands, and horrible the end"
300,1,591,"Shall make thy humour. If it be what thy suspects intend,"
300,1,592,What then? ’Tis my free will it should; to which let way be giv’n
300,1,593,With silence. Curb your tongue in time; lest all the Gods in heav’n
300,1,594,"Too few be and too weak to help thy punish’d insolence,"
300,1,595,When my inaccessible hands shall fall on thee.” The sense
300,1,596,"Of this high threat’ning made her fear, and silent she sate down,"
300,1,597,Humbling her great heart. All the Gods in court of Jove did frown
300,1,598,"At this offence giv’n; amongst whom heav’n’s famous artizan,"
300,1,599,"Ephaistus, in his mother’s care, this comely speech began:"
300,1,600,"“Believe it, these words will breed wounds, beyond our pow’rs to bear,"
300,1,601,If thus for mortals ye fall out. Ye make a tumult here
300,1,602,That spoils our banquet. Evermore worst matters put down best.
300,1,603,"But, mother, though yourself be wise, yet let your son request"
300,1,604,"His wisdom audience. Give good terms to our lov’d father Jove,"
300,1,605,"For fear he take offence again, and our kind banquet prove"
300,1,606,"A wrathful battle. If he will, the heav’nly Light’ner can"
300,1,607,Take you and toss you from your throne; his pow’r Olympian
300,1,608,"Is so surpassing. Soften then with gentle speech his spleen,"
300,1,609,And drink to him; I know his heart will quickly down again.”
300,1,610,"This said, arising from his throne, in his lov’d mother’s hand"
300,1,611,"He put the double - handed cup, and said: “Come, do not stand"
300,1,612,"On these cross humours, suffer, bear, though your great bosom grieve,"
300,1,613,And lest blows force you; all my aid not able to relieve
300,1,614,"Your hard condition, though these eyes behold it, and this heart"
300,1,615,Sorrow to think it. ’Tis a task too dang’rous to take part
300,1,616,Against Olympius. I myself the proof of this still feel.
300,1,617,"When other Gods would fain have help’d, he took me by the heel,"
300,1,618,And hurl’d me out of heav’n. All day I was in falling down;
300,1,619,At length in Lemnos I strook earth. The likewise - falling sun
300,1,620,"And I, together, set; my life almost set too; yet there"
300,1,621,The Sintii cheer’d and took me up.” This did to laughter cheer
300,1,622,"White - wristed Juno, who now took the cup of him, and smil’d."
300,1,623,"The sweet peace - making draught went round, and lame Ephaistus fill’d"
300,1,624,Nectar to all the other Gods. A laughter never left
300,1,625,"Shook all the blesséd deities, to see the lame so deft"
300,1,626,"At that cup service. All that day, ev’n till the sun went down,"
300,1,627,"They banqueted, and had such cheer as did their wishes crown."
300,1,628,Nor had they music less divine; Apollo there did touch
300,1,629,"His most sweet harp, to which, with voice, the Muses pleas’d as much."
300,1,630,"But when the sun’s fair light was set, each Godhead to his house"
300,1,631,"Address’d for sleep, where ev’ry one, with art most curious,"
300,1,632,By heav’n’s great both - foot - halting God a sev’ral roof had built.
300,1,633,"Ev’n he to sleep went, by whose hand heav’n is with lightning gilt,"
300,1,634,"High Jove, where he had us’d to rest when sweet sleep seiz’d his eyes;"
300,1,635,"By him the golden - thron’d Queen slept, the Queen of deities."
300,1,636,THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK.
300,1,637,"[1] “_See my bed made_,” it may be Englished. The word is _ἀντιόωσαν_,"
300,1,638,which signifies _contra stantem_ as _standing of one side opposite to
300,1,639,another on the other side_; which yet others translate _capessentem et
300,1,640,"adornantem_; which since it shows best to a reader, I follow."
300,1,641,[2] This simile Virgil directly translates.
300,2,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,2,2,Jove calls a vision up from Somnus’ den
300,2,3,To bid Atrides muster up his men.
300,2,4,"The King, to Greeks dissembling his desire,"
300,2,5,Persuades them to their country to retire.
300,2,6,"By Pallas’ will, Ulysses stays their flight:"
300,2,7,And wise old Nestor heartens them to fight.
300,2,8,"They take their meat; which done, to arms they go,"
300,2,9,And march in good array against the foe.
300,2,10,"So those of Troy; when Iris, from the sky,"
300,2,11,Of Saturn’s son performs the embassy.
300,2,12,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,2,13,Beta the dream and synod cites;
300,2,14,And catalogues the naval knights.
300,2,15,"The other Gods, and knights at arms, all night slept; only Jove"
300,2,16,Sweet slumber seiz’d not; he discours’d how best he might approve
300,2,17,"His vow made for Achilles’ grace, and make the Grecians find"
300,2,18,"His miss in much death. All ways cast, this counsel serv’d his mind"
300,2,19,With most allowance; to despatch a harmful Dream to greet
300,2,20,"The king of men, and gave this charge: “Go to the Achive fleet,"
300,2,21,"Pernicious Dream, and, being arriv’d in Agamemnon’s tent,"
300,2,22,Deliver truly all this charge. Command him to convent
300,2,23,His whole host arm’d before these tow’rs; for now Troy’s broad - way’d
300,2,24,town
300,2,25,He shall take in; the heav’n - hous’d Gods are now indiff’rent grown:
300,2,26,Juno’s request hath won them; Troy now under imminent ills
300,2,27,"At all parts labours.” This charge heard, the Vision straight fulfils;"
300,2,28,"The ships reach’d, and Atrides’ tent, in which he found him laid,"
300,2,29,Divine sleep pour’d about his pow’rs. He stood above his head
300,2,30,"Like Nestor, grac’d of old men most, and this did intimate:"
300,2,31,“Sleeps the wise Atreus’ tame - horse son? A councillor of state
300,2,32,"Must not the whole night spend in sleep, to whom the people are"
300,2,33,"For guard committed, and whose life stands bound to so much care."
300,2,34,"Now hear me, then, Jove’s messenger, who, though far off from thee,"
300,2,35,"Is near thee yet in ruth and care, and gives command by me"
300,2,36,To arm thy whole host. Thy strong hand the broad - way’d town of Troy
300,2,37,Shall now take in; no more the Gods dissentiously employ
300,2,38,Their high - hous’d powers; Juno’s suit hath won them all to her;
300,2,39,"And ill fates overhang these tow’rs, address’d by Jupiter."
300,2,40,"Fix in thy mind this, nor forget to give it action, when"
300,2,41,"Sweet sleep shall leave thee.” Thus, he fled; and left the king of men"
300,2,42,"Repeating in discourse his dream, and dreaming still, awake,"
300,2,43,"Of pow’r, not ready yet for act. O fool, he thought to take"
300,2,44,In that next day old Priam’s town; not knowing what affairs
300,2,45,"Jove had in purpose, who prepar’d, by strong fight, sighs and cares"
300,2,46,"For Greeks and Trojans. The Dream gone, his voice still murmured"
300,2,47,"About the king’s ears; who sate up, put on him in his bed"
300,2,48,"His silken inner weed, fair, new; and then in haste arose,"
300,2,49,"Cast on his ample mantle, tied to his soft feet fair shoes,"
300,2,50,"His silver - hilted sword he hung about his shoulder, took"
300,2,51,"His father’s sceptre never stain’d, which then abroad he shook,"
300,2,52,"And went to fleet. And now great heav’n Goddess Aurora scal’d,"
300,2,53,"To Jove, and all Gods, bringing light; when Agamemnon call’d"
300,2,54,"His heralds, charging them aloud to call to instant court"
300,2,55,The thick - hair’d Greeks. The heralds call’d; the Greeks made quick
300,2,56,resort.
300,2,57,"The Council chiefly he compos’d of old great - minded men,"
300,2,58,"At Nestor’s ships, the Pylian king. All there assembled then,"
300,2,59,"Thus Atreus’ son begun the court: “Hear, friends: A Dream divine,"
300,2,60,"Amidst the calm night in my sleep, did through my shut eyes shine,"
300,2,61,Within my fantasy. His form did passing naturally
300,2,62,"Resemble Nestor; such attire, a stature just as high."
300,2,63,"He stood above my head, and words thus fashion’d did relate:"
300,2,64,‘Sleeps the wise Atreus’ tame - horse son? A councillor of state
300,2,65,"Must not the whole night spend in sleep, to whom the people are"
300,2,66,"For guard committed, and whose life stands bound to so much care."
300,2,67,"Now hear me then, Jove’s messenger, who, though far off from thee,"
300,2,68,"Is near thee yet in love and care, and gives command by me"
300,2,69,To arm thy whole host. Thy strong hand the broad - way’d town of Troy
300,2,70,Shall now take in; no more the Gods dissentiously employ
300,2,71,Their high - hous’d pow’rs; Saturnia’s suit hath won them all to her;
300,2,72,"And ill fates over - hang these tow’rs, address’d by Jupiter."
300,2,73,"Fix in thy mind this.’ This express’d, he took wing and away,"
300,2,74,And sweet sleep left me. Let us then by all our means assay
300,2,75,To arm our army; I will first (as far as fits our right)
300,2,76,"Try their addictions, and command with full - sail’d ships our flight;"
300,2,77,"Which if they yield to, oppose you.” He sate, and up arose"
300,2,78,"Nestor, of sandy Pylos king, who, willing to dispose"
300,2,79,"Their counsel to the public good, propos’d this to the state:"
300,2,80,"“Princes and Councillors of Greece, if any should relate"
300,2,81,"This vision but the king himself, it might be held a tale,"
300,2,82,And move the rather our retreat; but since our General
300,2,83,"Affirms he saw it, hold it true, and all our best means make"
300,2,84,"To arm our army.” This speech us’d, he first the Council brake;"
300,2,85,"The other sceptre - bearing States arose too, and obey’d"
300,2,86,"The people’s Rector. Being abroad, the earth was overlaid"
300,2,87,"With flockers to them, that came forth, as when of frequent bees"
300,2,88,"Swarms rise out of a hollow rock, repairing the degrees"
300,2,89,"Of their egression endlessly, with ever rising new"
300,2,90,"From forth their sweet nest; as their store, still as it faded, grew,"
300,2,91,"And never would cease sending forth her clusters to the spring,"
300,2,92,"They still crowd out so; this fleck here, that there, belabouring"
300,2,93,The loaded flow’rs; so from the ships and tents the army’s store
300,2,94,"Troop’d to these princes and the court, along th’ unmeasur’d shore;"
300,2,95,"Amongst whom, Jove’s ambassadress, Fame, in her virtue shin’d,"
300,2,96,"Exciting greediness to hear. The rabble, thus inclin’d,"
300,2,97,Hurried together; uproar seiz’d the high court; earth did groan
300,2,98,Beneath the settling multitude; tumult was there alone.
300,2,99,"Thrice - three vocif’rous heralds rose, to check the rout, and get"
300,2,100,Ear to their Jove - kept governors; and instantly was set
300,2,101,"That huge confusion; ev’ry man set fast, the clamour ceas’d."
300,2,102,"Then stood divine Atrides up, and in his hand compress’d"
300,2,103,"His sceptre, th’ elaborate work of fi’ry Mulciber,"
300,2,104,Who gave it to Saturnian Jove; Jove to his messenger;
300,2,105,"His messenger, Argicides, to Pelops, skill’d in horse;"
300,2,106,"Pelops to Atreus, chief of men; he, dying, gave it course"
300,2,107,"To prince Thyestes, rich in herds; Thyestes to the hand"
300,2,108,"Of Agamemnon render’d it, and with it the command"
300,2,109,"Of many isles, and Argos all. On this he leaning, said:"
300,2,110,"“O friends, great sons of Danaus, servants of Mars, Jove laid"
300,2,111,"A heavy curse on me, to vow, and bind it with the bent"
300,2,112,"Of his high forehead; that, this Troy of all her people spent,"
300,2,113,"I should return; yet now to mock our hopes built on his vow,"
300,2,114,"And charge ingloriously my flight, when such an overthrow"
300,2,115,Of brave friends I have authored. But to his mightiest will
300,2,116,"We must submit us, that hath raz’d, and will be razing still,"
300,2,117,"Men’s footsteps from so many towns; because his pow’r is most,"
300,2,118,He will destroy most. But how vile such and so great an host
300,2,119,"Will show to future times, that, match’d with lesser numbers far,"
300,2,120,"We fly, not putting on the crown of our so - long - held war,"
300,2,121,Of which there yet appears no end! Yet should our foes and we
300,2,122,"Strike truce, and number both our pow’rs; Troy taking all that be"
300,2,123,"Her arm’d inhabitants, and we, in tens, should all sit down"
300,2,124,"At our truce banquet, ev’ry ten allow’d one of the town"
300,2,125,To fill his feast - cup; many tens would their attendant want;
300,2,126,So much I must affirm our pow’r exceeds th’ inhabitant.
300,2,127,"But their auxiliáry bands, those brandishers of spears,"
300,2,128,"From many cities drawn, are they that are our hinderers,"
300,2,129,"Not suff’ring well - rais’d Troy to fall. Nine years are ended now,"
300,2,130,"Since Jove our conquest vow’d; and now, our vessels rotten grow,"
300,2,131,"Our tackling falls; our wives, young sons, sit in their doors and long"
300,2,132,"For our arrival; yet the work, that should have wreak’d our wrong,"
300,2,133,"And made us welcome, lies unwrought. Come then, as I bid, all"
300,2,134,"Obey, and fly to our lov’d home; for now, nor ever, shall"
300,2,135,"Our utmost take - in broad - way’d Troy.” This said, the multitude"
300,2,136,Was all for home; and all men else that what this would conclude
300,2,137,"Had not discover’d. All the crowd was shov’d about the shore,"
300,2,138,"In sway, like rude and raging waves, rous’d with the fervent blore"
300,2,139,"Of th’ east and south winds, when they break from Jove’s clouds, and"
300,2,140,are borne
300,2,141,On rough backs of th’ Icarian seas: or like a field of corn
300,2,142,"High grown, that Zephyr’s vehement gusts bring eas’ly underneath,"
300,2,143,And make the stiff up - bristled ears do homage to his breath;
300,2,144,"For ev’n so eas’ly, with the breath Atrides us’d, was sway’d"
300,2,145,"The violent multitude. To fleet with shouts, and disarray’d,"
300,2,146,"All rush’d; and, with a fog of dust, their rude feet dimm’d the day;"
300,2,147,"Each cried to other, “Cleanse our ships, come, launch, aboard, away.”"
300,2,148,"The clamour of the runners home reach’d heav’n; and then, past fate,"
300,2,149,"The Greeks had left Troy, had not then the Goddess of estate"
300,2,150,"Thus spoke to Pallas: “O foul shame, thou untam’d seed of Jove,"
300,2,151,Shall thus the sea’s broad back be charg’d with these our friends’
300,2,152,"remove,"
300,2,153,"Thus leaving Argive Helen here, thus Priam grac’d, thus Troy,"
300,2,154,"In whose fields, far from their lov’d own, for Helen’s sake, the joy"
300,2,155,And life of so much Grecian birth is vanish’d? Take thy way
300,2,156,"T’ our brass - arm’d people, speak them fair, let not a man obey"
300,2,157,"The charge now giv’n, nor launch one ship.” She said, and Pallas did"
300,2,158,"As she commanded; from the tops of heav’n’s steep hill she slid,"
300,2,159,And straight the Greeks’ swift ships she reach’d; Ulysses (like to Jove
300,2,160,In gifts of counsel) she found out; who to that base remove
300,2,161,"Stirr’d not a foot, nor touch’d a ship, but griev’d at heart to see"
300,2,162,That fault in others. To him close the blue - eyed Deity
300,2,163,"Made way, and said: “Thou wisest Greek, divine Laertes’ son,"
300,2,164,Thus fly ye homewards to your ships? Shall all thus headlong run?
300,2,165,"Glory to Priam thus ye leave, glory to all his friends,"
300,2,166,"If thus ye leave her here, for whom so many violent ends"
300,2,167,"Have clos’d your Greek eyes, and so far from their so loved home."
300,2,168,"Go to these people, use no stay, with fair terms overcome"
300,2,169,"Their foul endeavour, not a man a flying sail let hoice.”"
300,2,170,"Thus spake she; and Ulysses knew ’twas Pallas by her voice,"
300,2,171,"Ran to the runners, cast from him his mantle, which his man"
300,2,172,"And herald, grave Eurybates, the Ithacensian"
300,2,173,"That follow’d him, took up. Himself to Agamemnon went,"
300,2,174,"His incorrupted sceptre took, his sceptre of descent,"
300,2,175,"And with it went about the fleet. What prince, or man of name,"
300,2,176,"He found flight - giv’n, he would restrain with words of gentlest blame:"
300,2,177,"“Good sir, it fits not you to fly, or fare as one afraid,"
300,2,178,"You should not only stay yourself, but see the people staid."
300,2,179,"You know not clearly, though you heard the king’s words, yet his mind;"
300,2,180,"He only tries men’s spirits now, and, whom his trials find"
300,2,181,"Apt to this course, he will chastise, Nor you, nor I, heard all"
300,2,182,"He spake in council; nor durst press too near our General,"
300,2,183,Lest we incens’d him to our hurt. The anger of a king
300,2,184,"Is mighty; he is kept of Jove, and from Jove likewise spring"
300,2,185,"His honours, which, out of the love of wise Jove, he enjoys.”"
300,2,186,"Thus he the best sort us’d; the worst, whose spirits brake out in"
300,2,187,"noise,"
300,2,188,"He cudgell’d with his sceptre, chid, and said: “Stay, wretch, be still,"
300,2,189,"And hear thy betters; thou art base, and both in pow’r and skill"
300,2,190,"Poor and unworthy, without name in council or in war."
300,2,191,"We must not all be kings. The rule is most irregular,"
300,2,192,"Where many rule. One lord, one king, propose to thee; and he,"
300,2,193,"To whom wise Saturn’s son, hath giv’n both law and empery"
300,2,194,"To rule the public, is that king.” Thus ruling, he restrain’d"
300,2,195,The host from flight; and then again the Council was maintain’d
300,2,196,"With such a concourse, that the shore rung with the tumult made;"
300,2,197,As when the far - resounding sea doth in its rage invade
300,2,198,"His sandy confines, whose sides groan with his involvéd wave,"
300,2,199,"And make his own breast echo sighs. All sate, and audience gave."
300,2,200,Thersites only would speak all. A most disorder’d store
300,2,201,"Of words he foolishly pour’d out, of which his mind held more"
300,2,202,"Than it could manage; any thing, with which he could procure"
300,2,203,"Laughter, he never could contain. He should have yet been sure"
300,2,204,To touch no kings; t’ oppose their states becomes not jesters’ parts.
300,2,205,But he the filthiest fellow was of all that had deserts
300,2,206,"In Troy’s brave siege; he was squint - ey’d, and lame of either foot;"
300,2,207,"So crook - back’d, that he had no breast; sharp - headed, where did shoot"
300,2,208,(Here and there spers’d) thin mossy hair. He most of all envíed
300,2,209,"Ulysses and Æacides, whom still his spleen would chide."
300,2,210,Nor could the sacred King himself avoid his saucy vein;
300,2,211,"Against whom since he knew the Greeks did vehement hates sustain,"
300,2,212,"Being angry for Achilles’ wrong, he cried out, railing thus:"
300,2,213,"“Atrides, why complain’st thou now? What would’st thou more of us?"
300,2,214,"Thy tents are full of brass; and dames, the choice of all, are thine,"
300,2,215,"With whom we must present thee first, when any towns resign"
300,2,216,"To our invasion. Want’st thou then, besides all this, more gold"
300,2,217,"From Troy’s knights to redeem their sons, whom to be dearly sold"
300,2,218,I or some other Greek must take? Or would’st thou yet again
300,2,219,"Force from some other lord his prise, to soothe the lusts that reign"
300,2,220,In thy encroaching appetite? It fits no prince to be
300,2,221,"A prince of ill, and govern us, or lead our progeny"
300,2,222,"By rape to ruin. O base Greeks, deserving infamy,"
300,2,223,"And ills eternal! Greekish girls, not Greeks, ye are! Come, fly"
300,2,224,"Home with our ships; leave this man here to perish with his preys,"
300,2,225,And try if we help’d him or not; he wrong’d a man that weighs
300,2,226,"Far more than he himself in worth; he forc’d from Thetis’ son,"
300,2,227,And keeps his prise still. Nor think I that mighty man hath won
300,2,228,"The style of wrathful worthily; he’s soft, he’s too remiss;"
300,2,229,"Or else, Atrides, his had been thy last of injuries.”"
300,2,230,Thus he the people’s Pastor chid; but straight stood up to him
300,2,231,"Divine Ulysses, who, with looks exceeding grave and grim,"
300,2,232,"This bitter check gave: “Cease, vain fool, to vent thy railing vein"
300,2,233,"On kings thus, though it serve thee well; nor think thou canst"
300,2,234,"restrain,"
300,2,235,"With that thy railing faculty, their wills in least degree;"
300,2,236,"For not a worse, of all this host, came with our King than thee,"
300,2,237,To Troy’s great siege; then do not take into that mouth of thine
300,2,238,"The names of kings, much less revile the dignities that shine"
300,2,239,"In their supreme states, wresting thus this motion for our home,"
300,2,240,To soothe thy cowardice; since ourselves yet know not what will come
300,2,241,"Of these designments, if it be our good to stay, or go."
300,2,242,"Nor is it that thou stand’st on; thou revil’st our Gen’ral so,"
300,2,243,"Only because he hath so much, not giv’n by such as thou"
300,2,244,But our heroës. Therefore this thy rude vein makes me vow
300,2,245,(Which shall be curiously observ’d) if ever I shall hear
300,2,246,"This madness from thy mouth again, let not Ulysses bear"
300,2,247,"This head, nor be the father call’d of young Telemachus,"
300,2,248,"If to thy nakedness I take and strip thee not, and thus"
300,2,249,"Whip thee to fleet from council; send, with sharp stripes, weeping"
300,2,250,hence
300,2,251,"This glory thou affect’st to rail.” This said, his insolence"
300,2,252,He settled with his sceptre; strook his back and shoulders so
300,2,253,That bloody wales rose. He shrunk round; and from his eyes did flow
300,2,254,"Moist tears, and, looking filthily, he sate, fear’d, smarted, dried"
300,2,255,"His blubber’d cheeks; and all the prease, though griev’d to be denied"
300,2,256,"Their wish’d retreat for home, yet laugh’d delightsomely, and spake"
300,2,257,"Either to other: “O ye Gods, how infinitely take"
300,2,258,"Ulysses’ virtues in our good! Author of counsels, great"
300,2,259,"In ord’ring armies, how most well this act became his heat,"
300,2,260,"To beat from council this rude fool! I think his saucy spirit,"
300,2,261,"Hereafter, will not let his tongue abuse the sov’reign merit,"
300,2,262,Exempt from such base tongues as his.” Thus spake the people; then
300,2,263,"The city - razer Ithacus stood up to speak again,"
300,2,264,"Holding his sceptre. Close to him gray - eyed Minerva stood,"
300,2,265,"And, like a herald, silence caus’d, that all the Achive brood"
300,2,266,"(From first to last) might hear and know the counsel; when, inclin’d"
300,2,267,"To all their good, Ulysses said: “Atrides, now I find"
300,2,268,These men would render thee the shame of all men; nor would pay
300,2,269,"Their own vows to thee, when they took their free and honour’d way"
300,2,270,"From Argos hither, that, till Troy were by their brave hands rac’d,"
300,2,271,"They would not turn home. Yet, like babes, and widows, now they haste"
300,2,272,"To that base refuge, ’Tis a spite to see men melted so"
300,2,273,"In womanish changes; though ’tis true, that if a man do go"
300,2,274,"Only a month to sea, and leave his wife far off, and he,"
300,2,275,"Tortur’d with winter’s storms, and toss’d with a tumultuous sea,"
300,2,276,"Grows heavy, and would home. Us then, to whom the thrice - three year"
300,2,277,"Hath fill’d his revoluble orb since our arrival here,"
300,2,278,"I blame not to wish home much more; yet all this time to stay,"
300,2,279,"Out of our judgments, for our end; and now to take our way"
300,2,280,"Without it, were absurd and vile. Sustain then, friends; abide"
300,2,281,The time set to our object; try if Calchas prophesied
300,2,282,"True of the time or not. We know, ye all can witness well,"
300,2,283,(Whom these late death - conferring fates have fail’d to send to hell)
300,2,284,"That when in Aulis, all our fleet, assembled with a freight"
300,2,285,"Of ills to Ilion and her friends, beneath the fair grown height"
300,2,286,"A platane bore, about a fount, whence crystal water flow’d,"
300,2,287,"And near our holy altar, we upon the Gods bestow’d"
300,2,288,"Accomplish’d hecatombs; and there appear’d a huge portent,"
300,2,289,"A dragon with a bloody scale, horrid to sight, and sent"
300,2,290,"To light by great Olympius; which, crawling from beneath"
300,2,291,"The altar, to the platane climb’d, and ruthless crash’d to death"
300,2,292,"A sparrow’s young, in number eight, that in a top - bough lay"
300,2,293,"Hid under leaves; the dam the ninth, that hover’d every way,"
300,2,294,"Mourning her lov’d birth, till at length, the serpent, watching her,"
300,2,295,"Her wing caught, and devour’d her too. This dragon, Jupiter,"
300,2,296,"That brought him forth, turn’d to a stone, and made a pow’rful mean"
300,2,297,"To stir our zeals up, that admir’d, when of a fact so clean"
300,2,298,"Of all ill as our sacrifice, so fearful an ostent"
300,2,299,"Should be the issue. Calchas, then, thus prophesied th’ event"
300,2,300,"‘Why are ye dumb - strook, fair - hair’d Greeks? Wise Jove is he hath shown"
300,2,301,"This strange ostent to us. ’Twas late, and passing lately done,"
300,2,302,"But that grace it foregoes to us, for suff’ring all the state"
300,2,303,"Of his appearance (being so slow) nor time shall end, nor fate."
300,2,304,"As these eight sparrows, and the dam (that made the ninth) were eat"
300,2,305,By this stern serpent; so nine years we are t’ endure the heat
300,2,306,"Of rav’nous war, and, in the tenth, take - in this broad - way’d town.’"
300,2,307,Thus he interpreted this sign; and all things have their crown
300,2,308,"As he interpreted, till now. The rest, then, to succeed"
300,2,309,"Believe as certain. Stay we all, till, that most glorious deed"
300,2,310,"Of taking this rich town, our hands are honour’d with.” This said,"
300,2,311,The Greeks gave an unmeasur’d shout; which back the ships repaid
300,2,312,"With terrible echoes, in applause of that persuasion"
300,2,313,Divine Ulysses us’d; which yet held no comparison
300,2,314,"With Nestor’s next speech, which was this: “O shameful thing! Ye talk"
300,2,315,"Like children all, that know not war. In what air’s region walk"
300,2,316,"Our oaths, and cov’nants? Now, I see the fit respects of men"
300,2,317,"Are vanish’d quite; our right hands giv’n, our faiths, our counsels"
300,2,318,"vain,"
300,2,319,"Our sacrifice with wine, all fled in that profanéd flame"
300,2,320,"We made to bind all; for thus still we vain persuasions frame,"
300,2,321,"And strive to work our end with words, not joining stratagemes"
300,2,322,"And hands together, though, thus long, the pow’r of our extremes"
300,2,323,"Hath urg’d us to them. Atreus’ son, firm as at first hour stand!"
300,2,324,"Make good thy purpose; talk no more in councils, but command"
300,2,325,"In active field. Let two or three, that by themselves advise,"
300,2,326,Faint in their crowning; they are such as are not truly wise;
300,2,327,"They will for Argos, ere they knew if that which Jove hath said"
300,2,328,"Be false or true. I tell them all, that high Jove bow’d his head,"
300,2,329,"As first we went aboard our fleet, for sign we should confer"
300,2,330,These Trojans their due fate and death; almighty Jupiter
300,2,331,"All that day darting forth his flames, in an unmeasur’d light,"
300,2,332,"On our right hand. Let therefore none once dream of coward flight,"
300,2,333,"Till (for his own) some wife of Troy he sleeps withal, the rape"
300,2,334,"Of Helen wreaking, and our sighs enforc’d for her escape."
300,2,335,"If any yet dare dote on home, let his dishonour’d haste"
300,2,336,"His black and well - built bark but touch, that (as he first disgrac’d"
300,2,337,"His country’s spirit) fate, and death, may first his spirit let go."
300,2,338,"But be thou wise, king, do not trust thyself, but others. Know"
300,2,339,I will not use an abject word. See all thy men array’d
300,2,340,"In tribes and nations, that tribes tribes, nations may nations, aid."
300,2,341,"Which doing, thou shalt know what chiefs, what soldiers, play the men,"
300,2,342,"And what the cowards; for they all will fight in sev’ral then,"
300,2,343,"Easy for note. And then shalt thou, if thou destroy’st not Troy,"
300,2,344,"Know if the prophecy’s defect, or men thou dost employ"
300,2,345,"In their approv’d arts want in war, or lack of that brave heat"
300,2,346,"Fit for the vent’rous spirits of Greece, was cause to thy defeat.”"
300,2,347,"To this the king of men replied: “O father, all the sons"
300,2,348,Of Greece thou conquer’st in the strife of consultations.
300,2,349,"I would to Jove, Athenia, and Phœbus, I could make,"
300,2,350,"Of all, but ten such counsellors; then instantly would shake"
300,2,351,"King Priam’s city, by our hands laid hold on and laid waste."
300,2,352,"But Jove hath order’d I should grieve, and to that end hath cast"
300,2,353,"My life into debates past end. Myself, and Thetis’ son,"
300,2,354,"Like girls, in words fought for a girl, and I th’ offence begun."
300,2,355,"But if we ever talk as friends, Troy’s thus deferréd fall"
300,2,356,"Shall never vex us more one hour. Come then, to victuals all,"
300,2,357,That strong Mars all may bring to field. Each man his lance’s steel
300,2,358,"See sharpen’d well, his shield well lin’d, his horses meated well,"
300,2,359,"His chariot carefully made strong, that these affairs of death"
300,2,360,"We all day may hold fiercely out. No man must rest, or breath;"
300,2,361,The bosoms of our targeteers must all be steeped in sweat;
300,2,362,The lancer’s arm must fall dissolv’d; our chariot - horse with heat
300,2,363,"Must seem to melt. But if I find one soldier take the chace,"
300,2,364,"Or stir from fight, or fight not still fix’d in his enemy’s face,"
300,2,365,"Or hid a - ship - board, all the world, for force, nor price, shall save"
300,2,366,"His hated life, but fowls and dogs be his abhorréd grave.”"
300,2,367,"He said; and such a murmur rose, as on a lofty shore"
300,2,368,"The waves make, when the south wind comes, and tumbles them before"
300,2,369,"Against a rock, grown near the strand which diversely beset"
300,2,370,"Is never free, but, here and there, with varied uproars beat."
300,2,371,"All rose then, rushing to the fleet, perfum’d their tents, and eat;"
300,2,372,"Each off’ring to th’ immortal gods, and praying to ’scape the heat"
300,2,373,Of war and death. The king of men an ox of five years’ spring
300,2,374,"T’ almighty Jove slew, call’d the peers; first Nestor; then the king"
300,2,375,Idomenëus; after them th’ Ajaces; and the son
300,2,376,"Of Tydeus; Ithacus the sixth, in counsel paragon"
300,2,377,To Jove himself. All these he bade; but at - a - martial - cry
300,2,378,"Good Menelaus, since he saw his brother busily"
300,2,379,"Employ’d at that time, would not stand on invitation,"
300,2,380,But of himself came. All about the off’ring over - thrown
300,2,381,"Stood round, took salt - cakes, and the king himself thus pray’d for all:"
300,2,382,"“O Jove, most great, most glorious, that, in that starry hall,"
300,2,383,"Sitt’st drawing dark clouds up to air, let not the sun go down,"
300,2,384,"Darkness supplying it, till my hands the palace and the town"
300,2,385,"Of Priam overthrow and burn; the arm, on Hector’s breast"
300,2,386,"Dividing, spoiling with my sword thousands, in interest"
300,2,387,"Of his bad quarrel, laid by him in dust, and eating earth.”"
300,2,388,"He pray’d; Jove heard him not, but made more plentiful the birth"
300,2,389,"Of his sad toils, yet took his gifts. Pray’rs past, cakes on they"
300,2,390,threw;
300,2,391,"The ox then, to the altar drawn, they kill’d, and from him drew"
300,2,392,"His hide, then cut him up, his thighs; in two hewn, dubb’d with fat,"
300,2,393,"Prick’d on the sweetbreads, and with wood, leaveless, and kindled at"
300,2,394,"Apposéd fire, they burn the thighs; which done, the inwards, slit,"
300,2,395,"They broil’d on coals and eat; the rest, in giggots cut, they spit,"
300,2,396,"Roast cunningly, draw, sit, and feast; nought lack’d to leave allay’d"
300,2,397,"Each temp’rate appetite; which serv’d, Nestor began and said:"
300,2,398,"“Atrides, most grac’d king of men, now no more words allow,"
300,2,399,Nor more defer the deed Jove vows. Let heralds summon now
300,2,400,"The brazen - coated Greeks, and us range ev’rywhere the host,"
300,2,401,To stir a strong war quickly up.” This speech no syllable lost;
300,2,402,"The high - voic’d heralds instantly he, charg’d to call to arms"
300,2,403,The curl’d - head Greeks; they call’d; the Greeks straight answer’d their

300,2,405,"The Jove - kept kings, about the king all gather’d, with their aid"

300,2,407,"Great Ægis (Jove’s bright shield) sustain’d, that can be never old,"
300,2,408,"Never corrupted, fring’d about with serpents forg’d of gold,"
300,2,409,"As many all suffic’d to make an hundred fringes, worth"
300,2,410,"An hundred oxen, ev’ry snake all sprawling, all set forth"
300,2,411,"With wondrous spirit. Through the host with this the Goddess ran,"
300,2,412,"In fury casting round her eyes, and furnish’d ev’ry man"
300,2,413,"With strength, exciting all to arms, and fight incessant. None"
300,2,414,Now lik’d their lov’d homes like the wars. And as a fire upon
300,2,415,"A huge wood, on the heights of hills, that far off hurls his light;"
300,2,416,"So the divine brass shin’d on these thus thrusting on for fight,"
300,2,417,Their splendour through the air reach’d heav’n. And as about the flood
300,2,418,"Caïster, in an Asian mead, flocks of the airy brood,"

300,2,421,"And in their falls layout such throats, that with their spiritful cry"
300,2,422,"The meadow shrieks again; so here, these many - nation’d men"
300,2,423,"Flow’d over the Scamandrian field, from tents and ships; the din"
300,2,424,Was dreadful that the feet of men and horse beat out of earth.
300,2,425,"And in the flourishing mead they stood, thick as the odorous birth"
300,2,426,"Of flow’rs, or leaves bred in the spring; or thick as swarms of flies"
300,2,427,"Throng then to sheep - cotes, when each swarm his erring wing applies"
300,2,428,To milk dew’d on the milk - maid’s pails; all eagerly dispos’d
300,2,429,"To give to ruin th’ Ilians. And as in rude heaps clos’d,"
300,2,430,"Though huge goatherds are at their food, the goatherds eas’ly yet"
300,2,431,Sort into sundry herds; so here the chiefs in battle set
300,2,432,"Here tribes, here nations, ord’ring all. Amongst whom shin’d the king,"
300,2,433,"With eyes like lightning - loving Jove, his forehead answering,"
300,2,434,"In breast like Neptune, Mars in waist. And as a goodly bull"
300,2,435,"Most eminent of all a herd, most wrong, most masterful,"
300,2,436,"So Agamemnon, Jove that day made overheighten clear"
300,2,437,"That heav’n - bright army, and preferr’d to all th’ heroës there."
300,2,438,"Now tell me, Muses, you that dwell in heav’nly roofs, (for you"
300,2,439,"Are Goddesses, are present here, are wise, and all things know,"
300,2,440,"We only trust the voice of fame, know nothing,) who they were"
300,2,441,"That here were captains of the Greeks, commanding princes here."
300,2,442,"The multitude exceed my song, though fitted to my choice"
300,2,443,"Ten tongues were, harden’d palates ten, a breast of brass, a voice"
300,2,444,"Infract and trump - like; that great work, unless the seed of Jove,"
300,2,445,"The deathless Muses, undertake, maintains a pitch above"
300,2,446,"All mortal pow’rs. The princes then, and navy that did bring"
300,2,447,"Those so inenarrable troops, and all their soils, I sing."

300,2,692,"Did plant their houses; and the men that did the meadows hold,"
300,2,693,Which Titaresius decks with flow’rs and his sweet current leads
300,2,694,"Into the bright Peneïus, that hath the silver heads,"
300,2,695,"Yet with his admirable stream doth not his waves commix,"
300,2,696,"But glides aloft on it like oil; for ’tis the flood of Styx,"
300,2,697,"By which th’ immortal Gods do swear. Teuthredon’s honour’d birth,"
300,2,698,"Prothous, led the Magnets forth, who near the shady earth"
300,2,699,"Of Pelius, and Peneïon, dwelt; forty revengeful sail"
300,2,700,Did follow him. These were the dukes and princes of avail
300,2,701,"That came from Greece. But now the man, that overshin’d them all,"
300,2,702,"Sing, Muse; and their most famous steeds to my recital call,"
300,2,703,That both th’ Atrides followéd. Fair Pheretiades
300,2,704,"The bravest mares did bring by much; Eumelius manag’d these,"
300,2,705,"Swift of their feet as birds of wing, both of one hair did shine,"
300,2,706,"Both of an age, both of a height, as measur’d by a line,"
300,2,707,"Whom silver - bow’d Apollo bred in the Pierian mead,"
300,2,708,"Both slick and dainty, yet were both in war of wondrous dread."
300,2,709,"Great Ajax Telamon for strength pass’d all the peers of war,"
300,2,710,While vex’d Achilles was away; but he surpass’d him far.
300,2,711,The horse that bore that faultless man were likewise past compare;
300,2,712,"Yet lay he at the crook’d - stern’d ships, and fury was his fare,"
300,2,713,"For Atreus’ son’s ungracious deed, his men yet pleas’d their hearts"
300,2,714,"With throwing of the holéd stone, with hurling of their darts,"
300,2,715,And shooting fairly on the shore; their horse at chariots fed
300,2,716,"On greatest parsley, and on sedge that in the fens is bred."
300,2,717,"His princes’ tents their chariots held, that richly cover’d were."
300,2,718,"His princes, amorous of their chief, walk’d storming here and there"
300,2,719,"About the host, and scorn’d to fight: their breaths as they did pass"
300,2,720,"Before them flew, as if a fire fed on the trembling grass;"
300,2,721,"Earth under - groan’d their high - rais’d feet, as when offended Jove,"
300,2,722,"In Arime, Typhœius with rattling thunder drove"
300,2,723,"Beneath the earth; in Arime, men say, the grave is still,"
300,2,724,"Where thunder tomb’d Typhœius, and is a monstrous hill;"
300,2,725,"And as that thunder made earth groan, so groan’d it as they past,"
300,2,726,"They trod with such hard - set - down steps, and so exceeding fast."
300,2,727,To Troy the rainbow - girded Dame right heavy news relates
300,2,728,"From Jove, as all to council drew in Priam’s palace - gates,"
300,2,729,"Resembling Priam’s son in voice, Polites, swift of feet;"
300,2,730,"In trust whereof, as sentinel, to see when from the fleet"
300,2,731,"The Grecians sallied, he was set upon the lofty brow"
300,2,732,Of aged Æsyetes’ tomb; and this did Iris show:
300,2,733,"“O Priam, thou art always pleas’d with indiscreet advice,"
300,2,734,"And fram’st thy life to times of peace, when such a war doth rise"
300,2,735,As threats inevitable spoil. I never did behold
300,2,736,"Such and so mighty troops of men, who trample on the mould"
300,2,737,"In number like Autumnus’ leaves, or like the marine sand,"
300,2,738,All ready round about the walls to use a ruining hand.
300,2,739,"Hector, I therefore charge thee most, this charge to undertake."
300,2,740,"A multitude remain in Troy, will fight for Priam’s sake,"
300,2,741,Of other lands and languages; let ev’ry leader then
300,2,742,Bring forth well - arm’d into the field his sev’ral bands of men.”
300,2,743,"Strong Hector knew a Deity gave charge to this assay,"
300,2,744,"Dismiss’d the council straight; like waves, clusters to arms do sway;"
300,2,745,"The ports are all wide open set; out rush’d the troops in swarms,"
300,2,746,Both horse and foot; the city run with sudden - cried alarms.
300,2,747,"A column stands without the town, that high his head doth raise,"
300,2,748,"A little distant, in a plain trod down with divers ways,"
300,2,749,"Which men do Batieia call, but the Immortals name"
300,2,750,"Myrine’s famous sepulchre, the wondrous active dame."
300,2,751,"Here were th’ auxiliary bands, that came in Troy’s defence,"
300,2,752,Distinguish’d under sev’ral guides of special excellence.
300,2,753,"The duke of all the Trojan pow’r great helm - deck’d Hector was,"
300,2,754,Which stood of many mighty men well - skill’d in darts of brass.
300,2,755,"Æneas of commixéd seed (a Goddess with a man,"
300,2,756,Anchises with the Queen of love) the troops Dardanian
300,2,757,Led to the field; his lovely sire in Ida’s lower shade
300,2,758,Begat him of sweet Cyprides; he solely was not made
300,2,759,"Chief leader of the Dardan pow’rs, Antenor’s valiant sons,"
300,2,760,"Archilochus and Acamas, were joind companions."
300,2,761,"Who in Zelia dwelt beneath the sacred foot of Ide,"
300,2,762,"That drank of black Æsepus’ stream, and wealth made full of pride,"
300,2,763,"The Aphnii, Lycaon’s son, whom Phœbus gave his bow,"
300,2,764,"Prince Pandarus did lead to field. Who Adrestinus owe,"
300,2,765,"Apesus’ city, Pityæ, and mount Tereiës,"
300,2,766,"Adrestus and stout Amphius led; who did their sire displease,"
300,2,767,"(Merops Percosius, that excell’d all Troy in heav’nly skill"
300,2,768,"Of futures - searching prophecy) for, much against his will,"
300,2,769,"His sons were agents in those arms; whom since they disobey’d,"
300,2,770,"The fates, in letting slip their threads, their hasty valours stay’d."
300,2,771,"Who in Percotes, Practius, Arisba, did abide,"
300,2,772,"Who Sestus and Abydus bred, Hyrtacides did guide;"
300,2,773,"Prince Asius Hyrtacides, that, through great Selees’ force,"
300,2,774,Brought from Arisba to that fight the great and fiery horse.
300,2,775,"Pylæus, and Hippothous, the stout Pelasgians led,"
300,2,776,Of them Larissa’s fruitful soil before had nourishéd;
300,2,777,"These were Pelasgian Pithus’ sons, son of Teutamidas."
300,2,778,"The Thracian guides were Pirous, and valiant Acamas,"
300,2,779,Of all that the impetuous flood of Hellespont enclos’d.
300,2,780,"Euphemus, the Ciconian troops, in his command dispos’d,"
300,2,781,Who from Trœzenius - Ceades right nobly did descend.
300,2,782,"Pyræchmes did the Pæons rule, that crookéd bows do bend;"
300,2,783,"From Axius, out of Amydon, he had them in command,"
300,2,784,"From Axius, whose most beauteous stream still overflows the land."
300,2,785,"Pylæmen with the well - arm’d heart, the Paphlagonians led,"
300,2,786,"From Enes, where the race of mules fit for the plough is bred."
300,2,787,"The men that broad Cytorus’ bounds, and Sesamus, enfold,"
300,2,788,"About Parthenius’ lofty flood, in houses much extoll’d,"
300,2,789,"From Cromna and Ægialus, the men that arms did bear,"
300,2,790,"And Erythinus situate high, Pylæmen’s soldiers were."
300,2,791,"Epistrophus and Dius did the Halizonians guide,"
300,2,792,"Far - fetch’d from Alybe, where first the silver mines were tried."
300,2,793,"Chromis, and augur Ennomus, the Mysians did command,"
300,2,794,"Who could not with his auguries the strength of death withstand,"
300,2,795,"But suffer’d it beneath the stroke of great Æacides,"
300,2,796,In Xanthus; where he made more souls dive to the Stygian seas.
300,2,797,"Phorcys, and fair Ascanius, the Phrygians brought to war,"
300,2,798,"Well train’d for battle, and were come out of Ascania far."
300,2,799,"With Methles, and with Antiphus, (Pylæmen’s sons) did fight"
300,2,800,"The men of Meïon, whom the fen Gygæa brought to light,"
300,2,801,And those Meionians that beneath the mountain Tmolus sprung.
300,2,802,"The rude unletter’d Caribæ, that barbarous were of tongue,"
300,2,803,"Did under Nastes’ colours march, and young Amphimachus,"
300,2,804,"(Nomion’s famous sons) to whom, the mountain Phthirorus"
300,2,805,"That with the famous wood is crown’d, Miletus, Mycales"
300,2,806,"That hath so many lofty marks for men that love the seas,"
300,2,807,"The crooked arms Mæander bow’d with his so snaky flood,"
300,2,808,Resign’d for conduct the choice youth of all their martial brood.
300,2,809,"The fool Amphimachus, to field, brought gold to be his wrack,"
300,2,810,Proud - girl - like that doth ever bear her dow’r upon her back;
300,2,811,"Which wise Achilles mark’d, slew him, and took his gold in strife,"
300,2,812,At Xanthus’ flood; so little Death did fear his golden life.
300,2,813,"Sarpedon led the Lycians, and Glaucus unreprov’d,"
300,2,814,"From Lycia, and the gulfy flood of Xanthus far remov’d."
300,2,815,THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK.
300,3,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,3,2,"Paris, betwixt the hosts, to single fight,"
300,3,3,"Of all the Greeks, dares the most hardy knight."
300,3,4,"King Menelaus doth accept his brave,"
300,3,5,Conditioning that he again should have
300,3,6,"Fair Helena, with all she brought to Troy,"
300,3,7,If he subdu’d; else Paris should enjoy
300,3,8,"Her, and her wealth, in peace. Conquest doth grant"
300,3,9,Her dear wreath to the Grecian combatant;
300,3,10,But Venus to her champion’s life doth yield
300,3,11,"Safe rescue, and conveys him from the field"
300,3,12,"Into his chamber, and for Helen sends,"
300,3,13,Whom much her lover’s foul disgrace offends;
300,3,14,"Yet Venus for him still makes good her charms,"
300,3,15,And ends the second combat in his arms.
300,3,16,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,3,17,Gamma the single fight doth sing
300,3,18,‘Twixt Paris and the Spartan king.
300,3,19,"When ev’ry least commander’s will best soldiers had obey’d,"
300,3,20,"And both the hosts were rang’d for fight, the Trojans would have fray’d"
300,3,21,"The Greeks with noises, crying out, in coming rudely on;"
300,3,22,"At all parts like the cranes that fill, with harsh confusion,"
300,3,23,"Of brutish clangés all the air, and in ridiculous war"
300,3,24,"(Eschewing the unsuffer’d storms, shot from the winter’s star)"
300,3,25,"Visit the ocean, and confer the Pygmei soldiers’ death."
300,3,26,"The Greeks charg’d silent, and like men, bestow’d their thrifty breath"
300,3,27,"In strength of far - resounding blows, still entertaining care"
300,3,28,"Of either’s rescue, when their strength did their engagements dare."
300,3,29,"And as, upon a hill’s steep tops, the south wind pours a cloud,"
300,3,30,"To shepherds thankless, but by thieves that love the night, allow’d,"
300,3,31,"A darkness letting down, that blinds a stone’s cast off men’s eyes;"
300,3,32,Such darkness from the Greeks’ swift feet (made all of dust) did rise.
300,3,33,"But, ere stern conflict mix’d both strengths, fair Paris stept before"
300,3,34,"The Trojan host; athwart his back a panther’s hide he wore,"
300,3,35,"A crookéd bow, and sword, and shook two brazen - headed darts;"
300,3,36,"With which well - arm’d, his tongue provok’d the best of Grecian hearts"
300,3,37,"To stand with him in single fight. Whom when the man, wrong’d most"
300,3,38,"Of all the Greeks, so gloriously saw stalk before the host;"
300,3,39,"As when a lion is rejoic’d, (with hunger half forlorn,)"
300,3,40,"That finds some sweet prey, as a hart, whose grace lies in his horn,"
300,3,41,"Or sylvan goat, which he devours, though never so pursu’d"
300,3,42,"With dogs and men; so Sparta’s king exulted, when he viewed"
300,3,43,"The fair - fac’d Paris so expos’d to his so thirsted wreak,"
300,3,44,"Whereof his good cause made him sure. The Grecian front did break,"
300,3,45,"And forth he rush’d, at all parts arm’d, leapt from his chariot,"
300,3,46,"And royally prepar’d for charge. Which seen, cold terror shot"
300,3,47,"The heart of Paris, who retir’d as headlong from the king"
300,3,48,As in him he had shunn’d his death. And as a hilly spring
300,3,49,"Presents a serpent to a man, full underneath his feet,"
300,3,50,"Her blue neck, swoln with poison, rais’d, and her sting out, to greet"
300,3,51,"His heedless entry, suddenly his walk he altereth,"
300,3,52,"Starts back amaz’d, is shook with fear, and looks as pale as death;"
300,3,53,So Menelaus Paris scar’d; so that divine - fac’d foe
300,3,54,"Shrunk in his beauties. Which beheld by Hector, he let go"
300,3,55,"This bitter check at him; “Accurs’d, made but in beauty’s scorn,"
300,3,56,"Impostor, woman’s man! O heav’n, that thou hadst ne’er been born,"
300,3,57,"Or, being so manless, never liv’d to bear man’s noblest state,"
300,3,58,"The nuptial honour! Which I wish, because it were a fate"
300,3,59,Much better for thee than this shame. This spectacle doth make
300,3,60,"A man a monster. Hark! how loud the Greeks laugh, who did take"
300,3,61,Thy fair form for a continent of parts as fair. A rape
300,3,62,"Thou mad’st of nature, like their queen. No soul, an empty shape,"
300,3,63,Takes up thy being; yet how spite to ev’ry shade of good
300,3,64,"Fills it with ill! for as thou art, thou couldst collect a brood"
300,3,65,"Of others like thee, and far hence fetch ill enough to us,"
300,3,66,Ev’n to thy father; all these friends make those foes mock them thus
300,3,67,"In thee, for whose ridiculous sake so seriously they lay"
300,3,68,"All Greece, and fate, upon their necks. O wretch! Not dare to stay"
300,3,69,Weak Menelaus? But ’twas well; for in him thou hadst tried
300,3,70,"What strength lost beauty can infuse, and with the more grief died"
300,3,71,"To feel thou robb’dst a worthier man, to wrong a soldier’s right."
300,3,72,"Your harp’s sweet touch, curl’d locks, fine shape, and gifts so"
300,3,73,"exquisite,"
300,3,74,"Giv’n thee by Venus, would have done your fine dames little good,"
300,3,75,"When blood and dust had ruffled them, and had as little stood"
300,3,76,Thyself in stead; but what thy care of all these in thee flies
300,3,77,We should inflict on thee ourselves. Infectious cowardice
300,3,78,In thee hath terrified our host; for which thou well deserv’st
300,3,79,"A coat of tombstone, not of steel in which, for form, thou serv’st.”"
300,3,80,"To this thus Paris spake, (for form, that might inhabit heav’n)"
300,3,81,"“Hector, because thy sharp reproof is out of justice giv’n,"
300,3,82,"I take it well; but though thy heart, inur’d to these affrights,"
300,3,83,"Cuts through them as an axe through oak, that more us’d more excites"
300,3,84,"The workman’s faculty, whose art can make the edge go far,"
300,3,85,"Yet I, less practis’d than thyself in these extremes of war,"
300,3,86,"May well be pardon’d, though less bold; in these your worth exceeds,"
300,3,87,In others mine. Nor is my mind of less force to the deeds
300,3,88,"Requir’d in war, because my form more flows in gifts of peace."
300,3,89,"Reproach not, therefore, the kind gifts of golden Cyprides."
300,3,90,All heav’n’s gifts have their worthy price; as little to be scorn’d
300,3,91,"As to be won with strength, wealth, state; with which to be adorn’d,"
300,3,92,"Some men would change state, wealth, or strength. But, if your martial"
300,3,93,heart
300,3,94,"Wish me to make my challenge good, and hold it such a part"
300,3,95,"Of shame to give it over thus, cause all the rest to rest,"
300,3,96,"And, ’twixt both hosts, let Sparta’s king and me perform our best"
300,3,97,"For Helen and the wealth she brought; and he that overcomes,"
300,3,98,"Or proves superior any way, in all your equal dooms,"
300,3,99,"Let him enjoy her utmost wealth, keep her, or take her home;"
300,3,100,"The rest strike leagues of endless date, and hearty friends become;"
300,3,101,"You dwelling safe in gleby Troy, the Greeks retire their force"
300,3,102,"T’ Achaia, that breeds fairest dames, and Argos, fairest horse.”"
300,3,103,"He said, and his amendsful words did Hector highly please,"
300,3,104,"Who rush’d betwixt the fighting hosts, and made the Trojans cease,"
300,3,105,By holding up in midst his lance. The Grecians noted not
300,3,106,"The signal he for parley used, but at him fiercely shot,"
300,3,107,"Hurl’d stones, and still were leveling darts. At last the king of men,"
300,3,108,"Great Agamemnon, cried aloud: “Argives! for shame, contain;"
300,3,109,"Youths of Achaia, shoot no more; the fair - helm’d Hector shows"
300,3,110,"As he desir’d to treat with us.” This said, all ceas’d from blows,"
300,3,111,"And Hector spake to both the hosts: “Trojans, and hardy Greeks,"
300,3,112,"Hear now what he that stirr’d these wars, for their cessation seeks."
300,3,113,"He bids us all, and you, disarm, that he alone may fight"
300,3,114,"With Menelaus, for us all, for Helen and her right,"
300,3,115,"With all the dow’r she brought to Troy; and he that wins the day,"
300,3,116,"Or is, in all the art of arms, superior any way,"
300,3,117,"The queen, and all her sorts of wealth, let him at will enjoy;"
300,3,118,"The rest strike truce, and let love seal firm leagues ’twixt Greece and"
300,3,119,Troy.”
300,3,120,The Greek host wonder’d at this brave; silence flew ev’rywhere;
300,3,121,"At last spake Sparta’s warlike king: “Now also give me ear,"
300,3,122,Whom grief gives most cause of reply. I now have hope to free
300,3,123,"The Greeks and Trojans of all ills, they have sustain’d for me,"
300,3,124,"And Alexander, that was cause I stretch’d my spleen so far."
300,3,125,"Of both then, which is nearest fate, let his death end the war;"
300,3,126,"The rest immediately retire, and greet all homes in peace."
300,3,127,"Go then (to bless your champion, and give his pow’rs success)"
300,3,128,"Fetch for the Earth, and for the Sun (the Gods on whom ye call)"
300,3,129,"Two lambs, a black one and a white, a female and a male;"
300,3,130,"And we another, for ourselves, will fetch, and kill to Jove."
300,3,131,"To sign which rites bring Priam’s force, because we well approve"
300,3,132,"His sons perfidious, envious, and (out of practis’d bane"
300,3,133,"To faith, when she believes in them) Jove’s high truce may profane."
300,3,134,All young men’s hearts are still unstaid; but in those well - weigh’d
300,3,135,deeds
300,3,136,"An old man will consent to pass things past, and what succeeds"
300,3,137,"He looks into, that he may know, how best to make his way"
300,3,138,"Through both the fortunes of a fact, and will the worst obey.”"
300,3,139,"This granted, a delightful hope both Greeks and Trojans fed,"
300,3,140,"Of long’d - for rest from those long toils, their tedious war had bred."
300,3,141,"Their horses then in rank they set, drawn from their chariots round,"
300,3,142,"Descend themselves, took off their arms, and plac’d them on the ground,"
300,3,143,Near one another; for the space ’twixt both the hosts was small.
300,3,144,"Hector two heralds sent to Troy, that they from thence might call"
300,3,145,"King Priam, and to bring the lambs, to rate the truce they swore."
300,3,146,"But Agamemnon to the fleet Talthybius sent before,"
300,3,147,To fetch their lamb; who nothing slack’d the royal charge was giv’n.
300,3,148,"Iris, the rain - bow, then came down, ambassadress from heav’n,"
300,3,149,To white - arm’d Helen. She assum’d at ev’ry part the grace
300,3,150,"Of Helen’s last love’s sister’s shape, who had the highest place"
300,3,151,"In Helen’s love, and had to name Laodice, most fair"
300,3,152,"Of all the daughters Priam had, and made the nuptial pair"
300,3,153,"With Helicaon, royal sprout of old Antenor’s seed."
300,3,154,"She found queen Helena at home, at work about a weed,"
300,3,155,"Wov’n for herself; it shin’d like fire, was rich, and full of size,"
300,3,156,The work of both sides being alike; in which she did comprise
300,3,157,The many labours warlike Troy and brass - arm’d Greece endur’d
300,3,158,"For her fair sake, by cruel Mars and his stern friends procur’d."
300,3,159,"Iris came in in joyful haste, and said; “O come with me,"
300,3,160,"Lov’d nymph, and an admiréd sight of Greeks and Trojans see,"
300,3,161,"Who first on one another brought a war so full of tears,"
300,3,162,"Ev’n thirsty of contentious war. Now ev’ry man forbears,"
300,3,163,"And friendly by each other sits, each leaning on his shield,"
300,3,164,"Their long and shining lances pitch’d fast by them in the field,"
300,3,165,"Paris, and Sparta’s king, alone must take up all the strife;"
300,3,166,And he that conquers only call fair Helena his wife.”
300,3,167,"Thus spake the thousand - colour’d Dame, and to her mind commends"
300,3,168,"The joy to see her first espous’d, her native tow’rs, and friends;"
300,3,169,"Which stirr’d a sweet desire in her: to serve the which she hied,"
300,3,170,"Shadow’d her graces with white veils, and (though she took a pride"
300,3,171,"To set her thoughts at gaze, and see, in her clear beauty’s flood,"
300,3,172,What choice of glory swum to her yet tender womanhood)
300,3,173,"Season’d with tears her joys to see more joys the more offence,"
300,3,174,And that perfection could not flow from earthly excellence.
300,3,175,"Thus went she forth, and took with her her women most of name,"
300,3,176,"Æthra, Pitthëus’ lovely birth, and Clymene, whom fame"
300,3,177,"Hath for her fair eyes memoris’d. They reach’d the Scæan Tow’rs,"
300,3,178,"Where Priam sat, to see the fight, with all his counsellors;"
300,3,179,"Panthous, Lampus, Clytius, and stout Hicetaon,"
300,3,180,"Thymœtes, wise Antenor, and profound Ucalegon;"
300,3,181,"All grave old men; and soldiérs they had been, but for age"
300,3,182,Now left the wars; yet counsellors they were exceeding sage.
300,3,183,"And as in well - grown woods, or trees, cold spiny grasshoppers"
300,3,184,"Sit chirping, and send voices out, that scarce can pierce our ears"
300,3,185,"For softness, and their weak faint sounds; so, talking on the tow’r,"
300,3,186,These seniors of the people sat; who when they saw the pow’r
300,3,187,"Of beauty, in the queen, ascend ev’n those cold - spirited peers,"
300,3,188,"Those wise and almost wither’d men, found this heat in their years,"
300,3,189,That they were forc’d (though whispéring) to say: “What man can blame
300,3,190,"The Greeks and Trojans to endure, for so admir’d a dame,"
300,3,191,"So many mis’ries, and so long? In her sweet count’nance shine"
300,3,192,Looks like the Goddesses. And yet (though never so divine)
300,3,193,"Before we boast, unjustly still, of her enforcéd prise,"
300,3,194,"And justly suffer for her sake, with all our progenies,"
300,3,195,"Labour and ruin, let her go; the profit of our land"
300,3,196,"Must pass the beauty.” Thus, though these could bear so fit a hand"
300,3,197,"On their affections, yet, when all their gravest powers were us’d,"
300,3,198,"They could not choose but welcome her, and rather they accus’d"
300,3,199,The Gods than beauty; for thus spake the most - fam’d king of Troy:
300,3,200,"“Come, lovéd daughter, sit by me and take the worthy joy"
300,3,201,"Of thy first husband’s sight, old friends, and princes near allied,"
300,3,202,"And name me some of these brave Greeks, so manly beautified."
300,3,203,"Come, do not think I lay the wars, endur’d by us, on thee,"
300,3,204,"The Gods have sent them, and the tears in which they swum to me."
300,3,205,"Sit then, and name this goodly Greek, so tall, and broadly spread,"
300,3,206,"Who than the rest, that stand by him, is higher by the head;"
300,3,207,"The bravest man I ever saw, and most majestical,"
300,3,208,His only presence makes me think him king amongst them all.”
300,3,209,"The fairest of her sex replied: “Most rev’rend father - in - law,"
300,3,210,"Most lov’d, most fear’d, would some ill death had seiz’d me, when I saw"
300,3,211,The first mean why I wrong’d you thus: that I had never lost
300,3,212,"The sight of these my ancient friends, of him that lov’d me most,"
300,3,213,"Of my sole daughter, brothers both, with all those kindly mates,"
300,3,214,"Of one soil, one age, born with me, though under diff’rent fates!"
300,3,215,But these boons envious stars deny; the memory of these
300,3,216,"In sorrow pines those beauties now, that then did too much please;"
300,3,217,"Nor satisfy they your demand, to which I thus reply:"
300,3,218,"That’s Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, the great in empery;"
300,3,219,"A king, whom double royalty doth crown, being great and good,"
300,3,220,"And one that was my brother - in - law, when I contain’d my blood,"
300,3,221,"And was more worthy; if at all I might be said to be,"
300,3,222,My being being lost so soon in all that honour’d me.”
300,3,223,"The good old king admir’d, and said: “O Atreus’ blesséd son,"
300,3,224,"Born unto joyful destinies, that hast the empire won"
300,3,225,"Of such a world of Grecian youths, as I discover here!"
300,3,226,"I once march’d into Phrygia, that many vines doth bear,"
300,3,227,"Where many Phrygians I beheld, well - skill’d in use of horse,"
300,3,228,"That of the two men, like two Gods, were the commanded force,"
300,3,229,"Otrëus, and great Mygdonus, who on Sangarius’ sands"
300,3,230,"Set down their tents with whom myself, for my assistant bands,"
300,3,231,Was number’d as a man in chief; the cause of war was then
300,3,232,"Th’ Amazon dames, that in their facts affected to be men."
300,3,233,"In all there was a mighty pow’r, which yet did never rise"
300,3,234,"To equal these Achaian youths, that have the sable eyes.”"
300,3,235,"Then (seeing Ulysses next) he said: “Lov’d daughter, what is he"
300,3,236,"That, lower than great Atreus’ son; seems by the head to me,"
300,3,237,"Yet, in his shoulders and big breast, presents a broader show?"
300,3,238,"His armour lies upon the earth; he up and down doth go,"
300,3,239,"To see his soldiers keep their ranks, and ready have their arms,"
300,3,240,"If, in this truce, they should be tried by any false alarms."
300,3,241,"Much like a well - grown bell - wether, or feltred ram, he shows,"
300,3,242,That walks before a wealthy flock of fair white - fleeced ewes.”
300,3,243,High Jove and Leda’s fairest seed to Priam thus replies:
300,3,244,"“This is the old Laertes’ son, Ulysses, call’d the wise;"
300,3,245,"Who, though unfruitful Ithaca was made his nursing seat,"
300,3,246,"Yet knows he ev’ry sort of sleight, and is in counsels great.”"
300,3,247,"The wise Antenor answer’d her: “’Tis true, renownéd dame;"
300,3,248,"For, some times past, wise Ithacus to Troy a legate came,"
300,3,249,"With Menelaus, for your cause; to whom I gave receipt"
300,3,250,"As guests, and welcom’d to my house, with all the love I might."
300,3,251,"I learn’d the wisdom of their souls, and humours of their blood;"
300,3,252,"For when the Trojan council met, and these together stood,"
300,3,253,"By height of his broad shoulders had Atrides eminence,"
300,3,254,"Yet, set, Ulysses did exceed, and bred more reverence."
300,3,255,"And when their counsels and their words they wove in one, the speech"
300,3,256,"Of Atreus’ son was passing loud, small, fast, yet did not reach"
300,3,257,"To much, being naturally born Laconical; nor would"
300,3,258,"His humour lie for anything, or was, like th’ other, old;"
300,3,259,"But when the prudent Ithacus did to his counsels rise,"
300,3,260,"He stood a little still, and fix’d upon the earth his eyes,"
300,3,261,"His sceptre moving neither way, but held it formally,"
300,3,262,"Like one that vainly doth affect. Of wrathful quality,"
300,3,263,"And frantic (rashly judging him) you would have said he was,"
300,3,264,"But when, out of his ample breast he gave his great voice pass,"
300,3,265,"And words that flew about our ears, like drifts of winter’s snow,"
300,3,266,"None thenceforth might contend with him, tho’ nought admir’d for show.”"
300,3,267,"The third man, aged Priam mark’d, was Ajax Telamon,"
300,3,268,"Of whom he ask’d: “What lord is that, so large of limb and bone,"
300,3,269,"So rais’d in height, that to his breast I see there reacheth none?”"
300,3,270,"To him the Goddess of her sex, the large - veil’d Helen, said:"
300,3,271,"“That Lord is Ajax Telamon, a bulwark in their aid."
300,3,272,"On th’ other side stands Idomen, in Crete of most command,"
300,3,273,And round about his royal sides his Cretan captains stand;
300,3,274,Oft hath the warlike Spartan king giv’n hospitable due
300,3,275,"To him within our Lacene court, and all his retinue."
300,3,276,And now the other Achive dukes I gen’rally discern;
300,3,277,"All which I know, and all their names could make thee quickly learn."
300,3,278,"Two princes of the people yet, I nowhere can behold,"
300,3,279,"Castor, the skilful knight on horse and Pollux, uncontroll’d"
300,3,280,"For all stand - fights, and force of hand; both at a burthen bred;"
300,3,281,My natural brothers; either here they have not followéd
300,3,282,"From lovely Sparta, or, arriv’d within the sea - born fleet,"
300,3,283,"In fear of infamy for me, in broad field shame to meet.”"
300,3,284,Nor so; for holy Tellus’ womb inclos’d those worthy men
300,3,285,"In Sparta, their belovéd soil. The voiceful heralds then"
300,3,286,The firm agreement of the Gods through all the city ring;
300,3,287,"Two lambs, and spirit - refreshing wine (the fruit of earth) they bring,"
300,3,288,Within a goat - skin bottle clos’d; Idæus also brought
300,3,289,"A massy glitt’ring bowl, and cups, that all of gold were wrought;"
300,3,290,"Which bearing to the king, they cried: “Son of Laomedon"
300,3,291,"Rise, for the well - rode peers of Troy, and brass - arm’d Greeks, in one,"
300,3,292,"Send to thee to descend the field, that they firm vows may make;"
300,3,293,"For Paris, and the Spartan king, must fight for Helen’s sake,"
300,3,294,"With long - arm’d lances; and the man that proves victorious,"
300,3,295,"The woman, and the wealth she brought, shall follow to his house;"
300,3,296,"The rest knit friendship, and firm leagues; we safe in Troy shall dwell,"
300,3,297,"In Argos and Achaia they, that do in dames excel.”"
300,3,298,"He said; and Priam’s aged joints with chilled fear did shake,"
300,3,299,Yet instantly he bade his men his chariot ready make.
300,3,300,"Which soon they did, and he ascends. He takes the reins, and guide"
300,3,301,"Antenor calls; who instantly mounts to his royal side,"
300,3,302,"And, through the Scæan ports to field, the swift - foot horse they drive."
300,3,303,"And when at them of Troy and Greece the aged lords arrive,"
300,3,304,"From horse, on Troy’s well - feeding soil, ’twixt both the hosts they go."
300,3,305,"When straight up - rose the king of men, up - rose Ulysses too,"
300,3,306,The heralds in their richest coats repeat (as was the guise)
300,3,307,"The true vows of the Gods (term’d theirs, since made before their eyes)"
300,3,308,"Then in a cup of gold they mix the wine that each side brings,"
300,3,309,And next pour water on the hands of both the kings of kings.
300,3,310,"Which done, Atrides drew his knife, that evermore he put"
300,3,311,Within the large sheath of his sword; with which away he cut
300,3,312,"The wool from both fronts of the lambs, which (as a rite in use"
300,3,313,"Of execration to their heads, that brake the plighted truce)"
300,3,314,"The heralds of both hosts did give the peers of both; and then,"
300,3,315,"With hands and voice advanc’d to heav’n, thus pray’d the king of men:"
300,3,316,"“O Jove, that Ida dost protect, and hast the titles won"
300,3,317,"Most glorious, most invincible; and thou all - seeing Sun,"
300,3,318,"All - hearing, all - recomforting; Floods; Earth; and Pow’rs beneath,"
300,3,319,That all the perjuries of men chastise ev’n after death!
300,3,320,"Be witnesses, and see perform’d the hearty vows we make. —"
300,3,321,"If Alexander shall the life of Menelaus take,"
300,3,322,"He shall from henceforth Helena, with all her wealth, retain,"
300,3,323,"And we will to our household Gods, hoise sail, and home again."
300,3,324,"If, by my honour’d brother’s hand, be Alexander slain,"
300,3,325,"The Trojans then shall his forc’d queen, with all her wealth, restore,"
300,3,326,"And pay convenient fine to us, aid ours for evermore."
300,3,327,"If Priam and his sons deny to pay his, thus agreed,"
300,3,328,"When Alexander shall be slain; or that perfidious deed,"
300,3,329,"And for the fine, will I fight here, till dearly they repay,"
300,3,330,"By death and ruin, the amends, that falsehood keeps away.”"
300,3,331,"This said, the throats of both the lambs cut with his royal knife,"
300,3,332,"He laid them panting on the earth, till, quite depriv’d of life,"
300,3,333,The steel had robb’d them of their strength; then golden cups they
300,3,334,"crown’d,"
300,3,335,"With wine out of a cistern drawn; which pour’d upon the ground,"
300,3,336,"They fell upon their humble knees to all the Deities,"
300,3,337,"And thus pray’d one of both the hosts, that might do sacrifice:"
300,3,338,"“O Jupiter, most high, most great, and all the deathless Pow’rs!"
300,3,339,"Who first shall dare to violate the late sworn oaths of ours,"
300,3,340,"So let the bloods and brains of them, and all they shall produce,"
300,3,341,"Flow on the stain’d face of the earth, as now this sacred juice;"
300,3,342,And let their wives with bastardice brand all their future race.”
300,3,343,"Thus pray’d they; but, with wish’d effects, their pray’rs Jove did not"
300,3,344,grace;
300,3,345,"When Priam said: “Lords of both hosts, I can no longer stay"
300,3,346,"To see my lov’d son try his life, and so must take my way"
300,3,347,To wind - exposéd Ilion. Jove yet and heav’n’s high States
300,3,348,"Know only, which of these must now pay tribute to the Fates.”"
300,3,349,"Thus, putting in his coach the lambs, he mounts and reins his horse;"
300,3,350,"Antenor to him; and to Troy, both take their speedy course."
300,3,351,"Then Hector, Priam’s martial son, stepp’d forth, and met the ground,"
300,3,352,"With wise Ulysses, where the blows of combat must resound;"
300,3,353,"Which done, into a helm they put two lots, to let them know"
300,3,354,Which of the combatants should first his brass - pil’d jav’lin throw;
300,3,355,"When all the people standing by, with hands held up to heav’n,"
300,3,356,"Pray’d Jove the conquest might not be by force or fortune giv’n,"
300,3,357,"But that the man, who was in right the author of most wrong,"
300,3,358,"Might feel his justice, and no more these tedious wars prolong,"
300,3,359,"But, sinking to the house of death, leave them (as long before)"
300,3,360,"Link’d fast in leagues of amity, that might dissolve no more."
300,3,361,"Then Hector shook the helm that held the equal dooms of chance,"
300,3,362,"Look’d back, and drew; and Paris first had lot to hurl his lance,"
300,3,363,"The soldiers all sat down enrank’d, each by his arms and horse"
300,3,364,That then lay down and cool’d their hoofs. And now th’ allotted course
300,3,365,Bids fair - hair’d Helen’s husband arm; who first makes fast his greaves
300,3,366,With silver buckles to his legs; then on his breast receives
300,3,367,The curets that Lycaon wore (his brother) but made fit
300,3,368,"For his fair body; next his sword he took, and fasten’d it,"
300,3,369,"All damask’d, underneath his arm; his shield then grave and great"
300,3,370,"His shoulders wore; and on his head his glorious helm he set,"
300,3,371,"Topp’d with a plume of horse’s hair, that horribly did dance,"
300,3,372,"And seem’d to threaten as he mov’d; at last he takes his lance,"
300,3,373,"Exceeding big, and full of weight, which he with ease could use."
300,3,374,"In like sort, Sparta’s warlike king himself with arms indues."
300,3,375,"Thus arm’d at either army both, they both stood bravely in,"
300,3,376,"Possessing both hosts with amaze, they came so chin to chin,"
300,3,377,"And, with such horrible aspécts, each other did salute."
300,3,378,"A fair large field was made for them; where wraths, for hugeness mute,"
300,3,379,"And mutual, made them mutually at either shake their darts"
300,3,380,Before they threw. Then Paris first with his long jav’lin parts;
300,3,381,"It smote Atrides’ orby targe, but ran not through the brass,"
300,3,382,For in it (arming well the shield) the head reflected was.
300,3,383,"Then did the second combatant apply him to his spear,"
300,3,384,"Which ere he threw, he thus besought almighty Jupiter:"
300,3,385,"“O Jove! Vouchsafe me now revenge, and that my enemy,"
300,3,386,"For doing wrong so undeserv’d, may pay deservedly"
300,3,387,"The pains he forfeited; and let these hands inflict those pains,"
300,3,388,"By conqu’ring, ay, by conqu’ring dead, him on whom life complains;"
300,3,389,"That any now, or anyone of all the brood of men"
300,3,390,"To live hereafter, may with fear from all offence abstain,"
300,3,391,"Much more from all such foul offence to him that was his host,"
300,3,392,And entertain’d him as the man whom he affected most.”
300,3,393,"This said, he shook and threw his lance; which strook through Paris’"
300,3,394,"shield,"
300,3,395,"And, with the strength he gave to it, it made the curets yield,"
300,3,396,"His coat of mail, his breast, and all, and drove his entrails in,"
300,3,397,In that low region where the guts in three small parts begin;
300,3,398,"Yet he, in bowing of his breast, prvented sable death."
300,3,399,"This taint he follow’d with his sword, drawn from a silver sheath,"
300,3,400,"Which lifting high, he strook his helm full where his plume did stand,"
300,3,401,"On which it piecemeal brake, and fell from his unhappy hand."
300,3,402,"At which he sighing stood, and star’d upon the ample sky,"
300,3,403,"And said: “O Jove, there is no God giv’n more illiberally"
300,3,404,"To those that serve thee than thyself, why have I pray’d in vain?"
300,3,405,"I hop’d my hand should have reveng’d, the wrongs I still sustain,"
300,3,406,"On him that did them, and still dares their foul defence pursue;"
300,3,407,"And now my lance hath miss’d his end, my sword in shivers flew,"
300,3,408,"And he ’scapes all.” With this, again he rush’d upon his guest,"
300,3,409,"And caught him by the horse - hair plume, that dangled on his crest,"
300,3,410,"With thought to drag him to the Greeks; which he had surely done,"
300,3,411,"And so, besides the victory, had wondrous glory won,"
300,3,412,"(Because the needle - painted lace, with which his helm was tied"
300,3,413,"Beneath his chin, and so about his dainty throat implied,"
300,3,414,"Had strangled him;) but that, in time, the Cyprian seed of Jove"
300,3,415,"Did brake the string, with which was lin’d that which the needle wove,"
300,3,416,And was the tough thong of a steer; and so the victor’s palm
300,3,417,"Was, for so full a man - at - arms, only an empty helm."
300,3,418,"That then he swung about his head, and cast among his friends,"
300,3,419,"Who scrambled, and took ’t up with shouts. Again then he intends"
300,3,420,"To force the life - blood of his foe, and ran on him amain,"
300,3,421,"With shaken jav’lin; when the Queen, that lovers loves, again[1]"
300,3,422,"Attended, and now ravish’d him from that encounter quite,"
300,3,423,"With ease, and wondrous suddenly; for she, a Goddess, might."
300,3,424,"She hid him in a cloud of gold, and never made him known,"
300,3,425,"Till in his chamber, fresh and sweet, she gently set him down,"
300,3,426,"And went for Helen; whom she found in Scæa’s utmost height,"
300,3,427,To which whole swarms of city dames had climb’d to see the sight.
300,3,428,"To give her errand good success, she took on her the shape"
300,3,429,"Of beldame Græa, who was brought by Helen, in her rape,"
300,3,430,"From Lacedæmon, and had trust in all her secrets still,"
300,3,431,"Being old, and had (of all her maids) the main bent of her will,"
300,3,432,"And spun for her her finest wool. Like her, Love’s Empress came,"
300,3,433,"Pull’d Helen by the heav’nly veil, and softly said: “Madame,"
300,3,434,"My lord calls for you, you must needs make all your kind haste home;"
300,3,435,"He’s in your chamber, stays, and longs; sits by your bed; pray come,"
300,3,436,"’Tis richly made, and sweet; but he more sweet, and looks so clear,"
300,3,437,"So fresh, and movingly attir’d, that, seeing, you would swear"
300,3,438,"He came not from the dusky fight, but from a courtly dance,"
300,3,439,Or would to dancing.” This she made a charm for dalliance;
300,3,440,"Whose virtue Helen felt, and knew, by her so radiant eyes,"
300,3,441,"White neck, and most enticing breasts, the deified disguise."
300,3,442,"At which amaz’d, she answer’d her: “Unhappy Deity!"
300,3,443,Why lov’st thou still in these deceits to wrap my phantasy?
300,3,444,"Or whither yet, of all the towns giv’n to their lust beside,"
300,3,445,"In Phrygia, or Mæonia, com’st thou to be my guide,"
300,3,446,"If there (of divers - languag’d men thou hast, as here in Troy,"
300,3,447,Some other friend to be my shame; since here thy latest joy
300,3,448,"By Menelaus now subdu’d, by him shall I be borne"
300,3,449,"Home to his court, and end my life in triumphs of his scorn?"
300,3,450,"And, to this end, would thy deceits my wanton life allure?"
300,3,451,"Hence, go thyself to Priam’s son and all the ways abjure"
300,3,452,"Of Gods, or godlike - minded dames, nor ever turn again"
300,3,453,Thy earth - affecting feet to heav’n but for his sake sustain
300,3,454,"Toils here; guard, grace him endlessly, till he requite thy grace"
300,3,455,"By giving thee my place with him; or take his servant’s place,"
300,3,456,"If, all dishonourable ways, your favours seek to serve"
300,3,457,"His never - pleas’d incontinence; I better will deserve,"
300,3,458,Than serve his dotage now. What shame were it for me to feed
300,3,459,This lust in him; all honour’d dames would hate me for the deed!
300,3,460,"He leaves a woman’s love so sham’d, and shows so base a mind,"
300,3,461,To feel nor my shame nor his own; griefs of a greater kind
300,3,462,Wound me than such as can admit such kind delights so soon.”
300,3,463,"The Goddess, angry that, past shame, her mere will was not done,"
300,3,464,"Replied: “Incense me not, you wretch, lest, once incens’d, I leave"
300,3,465,"Thy curs’d life to as strange a hate, as yet it may receive"
300,3,466,"A love from me; and lest I spread through both hosts such despite,"
300,3,467,"For those plagues they have felt for thee, that both abjure thee quite,"
300,3,468,"And setting thee in midst of both, turn all their wraths on thee,"
300,3,469,And dart thee dead; that such a death may wreak thy wrong of me.”
300,3,470,"This strook the fair dame with such fear, it took her speech away,"
300,3,471,"And, shadow’d in her snowy veil, she durst not but obey;"
300,3,472,"And yet, to shun the shame she fear’d, she vanish’d undescried"
300,3,473,"Of all the Trojan ladies there, for Venus was her guide."
300,3,474,"Arriv’d at home, her women both fell to their work in haste;"
300,3,475,"When she, that was of all her sex the most divinely grac’d,"
300,3,476,"Ascended to a higher room, though much against her will,"
300,3,477,"Where lovely Alexander was, being led by Venus still."
300,3,478,"The laughter - loving Dame discen’d her mov’d mind by her grace,"
300,3,479,"And, for her mirth sake, set a stool, full before Paris’ face,"
300,3,480,"Where she would needs have Helen sit; who, though she durst not choose"
300,3,481,"But sit, yet look’d away for all the Goddess’ pow’r could use,"
300,3,482,"And used her tongue too, and to chide whom Venus sooth’d so much,"
300,3,483,"And chid, too, in this bitter kind: “And was thy cowardice such,"
300,3,484,"So conquer’d, to be seen alive? O would to God, thy life"
300,3,485,"Had perish’d by his worthy hand, to whom I first was wife!"
300,3,486,"Before this, thou wouldst glorify thy valour and thy lance,"
300,3,487,"And, past my first love’s, boast them far. Go once more, and advance"
300,3,488,Thy braves against his single pow’r; this foil might fall by chance.
300,3,489,"Poor conquer’d man! ’Twas such a chance, as I would not advise"
300,3,490,"Thy valour should provoke again. Shun him, thou most unwise,"
300,3,491,"Lest next, thy spirit sent to hell, thy body be his prise.”"
300,3,492,"He answer’d: “Pray thee, woman, cease, to chide and grieve me thus."
300,3,493,Disgraces will not ever last. Look on their end. On us
300,3,494,"Will other Gods, at other times, let fall the victor’s wreath,"
300,3,495,As on him Pallas put it now. Shall our love sink beneath
300,3,496,"The hate of fortune? In love’s fire, let all hates vanish. Come,"
300,3,497,"Love never so inflam’d my heart; no, not when, bringing home"
300,3,498,"Thy beauty’s so delicious prise, on Cranaë’s blest shore"
300,3,499,"I long’d for, and enjoy’d thee first.” With this he went before,"
300,3,500,"She after, to the odorous bed. While these to pleasure yield,"
300,3,501,"Perplex’d Atrides, savage - like, ran up and down the field,"
300,3,502,"And ev’ry thickest troop of Troy, and of their far - call’d aid,"
300,3,503,"Search’d for his foe, who could not be by any eye betray’d;"
300,3,504,"Nor out of friendship (out of doubt) did they conceal his sight,"
300,3,505,"All hated him so like their deaths, and ow’d him such despite."
300,3,506,"At last thus spake the king of men: “Hear me, ye men of Troy,"
300,3,507,"Ye Dardans, and the rest, whose pow’rs you in their aids employ."
300,3,508,"The conquest on my brother’s part, ye all discern is clear,"
300,3,509,"Do you then Argive Helena, with all her treasure here,"
300,3,510,"Restore to us, and pay the mulct, that by your vows is due,"
300,3,511,"Yield us an honour’d recompense, and, all that should accrue"
300,3,512,"To our posterities, confirm; that when you render it,"
300,3,513,Our acts may here be memoris’d.” This all Greeks else thought fit.
300,3,514,THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK.
300,3,515,"[1] _When the Queen, etc._ — This place Virgil imitateth."
300,4,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,4,2,"The Gods in council, at the last, decree"
300,4,3,That famous Ilion shall expugned be;
300,4,4,And that their own continu’d faults may prove
300,4,5,"The reasons that have so incensed Jove,"
300,4,6,"Minerva seeks, with more offences done"
300,4,7,"Against the lately injur’d Atreus’ son,"
300,4,8,(A ground that clearest would make seen their sin)
300,4,9,To have the Lycian Pandarus begin.
300,4,10,He (’gainst the truce with sacred cov’nants bound)
300,4,11,"Gives Menelaus a dishonour’d wound,"
300,4,12,Machaon heals him. Agamemnon then
300,4,13,To mortal war incenseth all his men.
300,4,14,"The battles join; and, in the heat of fight,"
300,4,15,Cold death shuts many eyes in endless night.
300,4,16,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,4,17,In Delta is the Gods’ Assize;
300,4,18,The truce is broke; wars freshly rise.
300,4,19,"Within the fair - pav’d court of Jove, he and the Gods conferr’d"
300,4,20,About the sad events of Troy; amongst whom minister’d
300,4,21,"Bless’d Hebe nectar. As they sat, and did Troy’s tow’rs behold,"
300,4,22,"They drank, and pledg’d each other round in full - crown’d cups of gold."
300,4,23,The mirth at whose feast was begun by great Saturnides
300,4,24,"In urging a begun dislike amongst the Goddesses,"
300,4,25,"But chiefly in his solemn queen, whose spleen he was dispos’d"
300,4,26,"To tempt yet further, knowing well what anger it inclos’d,"
300,4,27,"And how wives’ angers should be us’d. On which, thus pleas’d, he"
300,4,28,play’d:
300,4,29,"“Two Goddesses there are that still give Menelaus aid,"
300,4,30,And one that Paris loves. The two that sit from us so far
300,4,31,"(Which Argive Juno is, and She that rules in deeds of war,)"
300,4,32,No doubt are pleas’d to see how well the late - seen fight did frame;
300,4,33,"And yet, upon the adverse part, the laughter - loving Dame"
300,4,34,"Made her pow’r good too for her friend; for, though he were so near"
300,4,35,"The stroke of death in th’ others’ hopes, she took him from them clear."
300,4,36,The conquest yet is questionless the martial Spartan king’s.
300,4,37,"We must consult then what events shall crown these future things,"
300,4,38,"If wars and combats we shall still with even successes strike,"
300,4,39,Or as impartial friendship plant on both parts. If ye like
300,4,40,"The last, and that it will as well delight as merely please"
300,4,41,"Your happy deities, still let stand old Priam’s town in peace,"
300,4,42,And let the Lacedæmon king again his queen enjoy.”
300,4,43,"As Pallas and Heav’n’s Queen sat close, complotting ill to Troy,"
300,4,44,With silent murmurs they receiv’d this ill - lik’d choice from Jove;
300,4,45,"‘Gainst whom was Pallas much incens’d, because the Queen of Love"
300,4,46,"Could not, without his leave, relieve in that late point of death"
300,4,47,"The son of Priam, whom she loath’d; her wrath yet fought beneath"
300,4,48,"Her supreme wisdom, and was curb’d; but Juno needs must ease"
300,4,49,"Her great heart with her ready tongue, and said; “What words are these,"
300,4,50,"Austere, and too - much - Saturn’s son? Why wouldst thou render still"
300,4,51,"My labours idle, and the sweat of my industrious will"
300,4,52,Dishonour with so little pow’r? My chariot - horse are tir’d
300,4,53,"With posting to and fro for Greece, and bringing banes desir’d"
300,4,54,"To people must’ring Priamus, and his perfidious sons;"
300,4,55,"Yet thou protect’st, and join’st with them whom each just Deity shuns."
300,4,56,"Go on, but ever go resolv’d all other Gods have vow’d"
300,4,57,"To cross thy partial course for Toy, in all that makes it proud.”"
300,4,58,"At this, the cloud - compelling Jove a far - fetch’d sigh let fly,"
300,4,59,And said: “Thou fury! What offence of such impiety
300,4,60,"Hath Priam or his sons done thee, that, with so high a hate,"
300,4,61,Thou shouldst thus ceaselessly desire to raze and ruinate
300,4,62,"So well a builded town as Troy? I think, hadst thou the pow’r,"
300,4,63,"Thou wouldst the ports and far - stretch’d walls fly over, and devour"
300,4,64,"Old Priam and his issue quick, and make all Troy thy feast,"
300,4,65,And then at length I hope thy wrath and tiréd spleen would rest;
300,4,66,"To which run on thy chariot, that nought be found in me"
300,4,67,"Of just cause to our future jars. In this yet strengthen thee,"
300,4,68,"And fix it in thy memory fast, this if I entertain"
300,4,69,As peremptory a desire to level with the plain
300,4,70,"A city where thy lovéd live, stand not betwixt my ire"
300,4,71,"And what it aims at, but give way, when thou hast thy desire;"
300,4,72,"Which now I grant thee willingly, although against my will."
300,4,73,"For not beneath the ample sun, and heav’n’s star - bearing hill,"
300,4,74,There is a town of earthly men so honour’d in my mind
300,4,75,"As sacred Troy; nor of earth’s kings as Priam and his kind,"
300,4,76,"Who never let my altars lack rich feast of off’rings slain,"
300,4,77,And their sweet savours; for which grace I honour them again.”
300,4,78,"Dread Juno, with the cow’s fair eyes, replied: “Three towns there are"
300,4,79,"Of great and eminent respect, both in my love and care;"
300,4,80,"Mycene, with the broad highways; and Argos, rich in horse;"
300,4,81,"And Sparta; all which three destroy, when thou envi’st their force,"
300,4,82,"I will not aid them, nor malign thy free and sov’reign will,"
300,4,83,"For if I should be envious, and set against their ill,"
300,4,84,"I know my envy were in vain, since thou art mightier far."
300,4,85,"But we must give each other leave, and wink at either’s war."
300,4,86,"I likewise must have pow’r to crown my works with wishéd end,"
300,4,87,"Because I am a Deity, and did from thence descend"
300,4,88,"Whence thou thyself, and th’ elder born; wise Saturn was our sire;"
300,4,89,"And thus there is a two - fold cause that pleads for my desire,"
300,4,90,"Being sister, and am call’d thy wife; and more, since thy command"
300,4,91,"Rules all Gods else, I claim therein a like superior hand."
300,4,92,"All wrath before then now remit, and mutually combine"
300,4,93,"In either’s empire; I, thy rule, and thou, illustrate, mine;"
300,4,94,"So will the other Gods agree, and we shall all be strong."
300,4,95,And first (for this late plot) with speed let Pallas go among
300,4,96,"The Trojans, and some one of them entice to break the truce"
300,4,97,By off’ring in some treach’rous wound the honour’d Greeks abuse.”
300,4,98,"The Father both of men and Gods agreed, and Pallas sent,"
300,4,99,"With these wing’d words, to both the hosts: “Make all haste, and invent"
300,4,100,"Some mean by which the men of Troy, against the truce agreed,"
300,4,101,May stir the glorious Greeks to arms with some inglorious deed.”
300,4,102,"Thus charg’d he her with haste that did, before, in haste abound,"
300,4,103,"Who cast herself from all the heights, with which steep heav’n is"
300,4,104,crown’d.
300,4,105,"And as Jove, brandishing a star, which men a comet call,"
300,4,106,"Hurls out his curled hair abroad, that from his brand exhals"
300,4,107,"A thousand sparks, to fleets at sea, and ev’ry mighty host,"
300,4,108,Of all presages and ill - haps a sign mistrusted most;
300,4,109,"So Pallas fell ’twixt both the camps, and suddenly was lost,"
300,4,110,"When through the breasts of all that saw, she strook a strong amaze"
300,4,111,"With viewing, in her whole descent, her bright and ominous blaze."
300,4,112,"When straight one to another turn’d, and said: “Now thund’ring Jove"
300,4,113,(Great Arbiter of peace and arms) will either stablish love
300,4,114,"Amongst our nations, or renew such war as never was.”"
300,4,115,"Thus either army did presage, when Pallas made her pass"
300,4,116,Amongst the multitude of Troy; who now put on the grace
300,4,117,"Of brave Laodocus, the flow’r of old Antenor’s race,"
300,4,118,"And sought for Lycian Pandarus, a man that, being bred"
300,4,119,"Out of a faithless family, she thought was fit to shed"
300,4,120,"The blood of any innocent, and break the cov’nant sworn;"
300,4,121,"He was Lycaon’s son, whom Jove into a wolf did turn"
300,4,122,"For sacrificing of a child, and yet in arms renown’d"
300,4,123,"As one that was inculpable. Him Pallas standing found,"
300,4,124,And round about him his strong troops that bore the shady shields;
300,4,125,"He brought them from Æsepus’ flood, let through the Lycian fields;"
300,4,126,"Whom standing near, she whisper’d thus: “Lycaon’s warlike son,"
300,4,127,Shall I despair at thy kind hands to have a favour done?
300,4,128,Nor dar’st thou let an arrow fly upon the Spartan king?
300,4,129,"It would be such a grace to Troy, and such a glorious thing,"
300,4,130,That ev’ry man would give his gift; but Alexander’s hand
300,4,131,"Would load thee with them, if he could discover from his stand"
300,4,132,"His foe’s pride strook down with thy shaft, and he himself ascend"
300,4,133,"The flaming heap of funeral. Come, shoot him, princely friend;"
300,4,134,"But first invoke the God of Light, that in thy land was born,"
300,4,135,"And is in archers’ art the best that ever sheaf hath worn,"
300,4,136,"To whom a hundred first - ew’d lambs vow thou in holy fire,"
300,4,137,When safe to sacred Zelia’s tow’rs thy zealous steps retire.”
300,4,138,"With this the mad gift - greedy man Minerva did persuade,"
300,4,139,"Who instantly drew forth a bow, most admirably made"
300,4,140,"Of th’ antler of a jumping goat bred in a steep upland,"
300,4,141,"Which archer - like (as long before he took his hidden stand,"
300,4,142,"The evicke skipping from a rock) into the breast he smote,"
300,4,143,And headlong fell’d him from his cliff. The forehead of the goat
300,4,144,"Held out a wondrous goodly palm, that sixteen branches brought;"
300,4,145,"Of all which join’d, an useful bow a skilful bowyer wrought,"
300,4,146,"Which pick’d and polish’d, both the ends he hid with horns of gold."
300,4,147,"And this bow, bent, he close laid down, and bad his soldiers hold"
300,4,148,"Their shields before him, lest the Greeks, discerning him, should rise"
300,4,149,In tumults ere the Spartan king could be his arrow’s prise.
300,4,150,"Mean space, with all his care he choos’d, and from his quiver drew,"
300,4,151,"An arrow, feather’d best for flight and yet that never flew,"
300,4,152,"Strong headed, and most apt to pierce; then took he up his bow,"
300,4,153,"And nock’d his shaft, the ground whence all their future grief did"
300,4,154,grow.
300,4,155,"When, praying to his God the Sun, that was in Lycia bred,"
300,4,156,"And king of archers, promising that he the blood would shed"
300,4,157,"Of full an hundred first - fall’n lambs, all offer’d to his name,"
300,4,158,"When to Zelia’s sacred walls from rescu’d Troy he came,"
300,4,159,"He took his arrow by the nock, and to his bended breast[1]"
300,4,160,"The oxy sinew close he drew, ev’n till the pile did rest"
300,4,161,Upon the bosom of the bow; and as that savage prise
300,4,162,"His strength constrain’d into an orb, as if the wind did rise"
300,4,163,"The coming of it made a noise, the sinew - forgéd string"
300,4,164,"Did give a mighty twang, and forth the eager shaft did sing,"
300,4,165,"Affecting speediness of flight, amongst the Achive throng."
300,4,166,"Nor were the blesséd Heav’nly Pow’rs unmindful of thy wrong,"
300,4,167,"O Menelaus, but, in chief, Jove’s seed: the Pillager,"
300,4,168,"Stood close before, and slack’d the force the arrow did confer,"
300,4,169,"With as much care and little hurt, as doth a mother use,"
300,4,170,"And keep off from her babe, when sleep doth through his pow’rs diffuse"
300,4,171,"His golden humour, and th’ assaults of rude and busy flies"
300,4,172,She still checks with her careful hand; for so the shaft she plies
300,4,173,"That on the buttons made of gold, which made his girdle fast,"
300,4,174,"And where his curets double were, the fall of it she plac’d."
300,4,175,And thus much proof she put it to: the buckle made of gold;
300,4,176,"The belt it fast’ned, bravely wrought; his curets’ double fold;"
300,4,177,"And last, the charméd plate he wore, which help’d him more than all,"
300,4,178,"And, ’gainst all darts and shafts bestow’d, was to his life a wall;"
300,4,179,"So, through all these, the upper skin the head did only race;"
300,4,180,"Yet forth the blood flow’d, which did much his royal person grace,"
300,4,181,"And show’d upon his ivory skin, as doth a purple dye"
300,4,182,"Laid, by a dame of Caïra, or lovely Mæony,"
300,4,183,"On ivory, wrought in ornaments to deck the cheeks of horse;"
300,4,184,Which in her marriage room must lie; whose beauties have such force
300,4,185,"That they are wish’d of many knights, but are such precious things,"
300,4,186,"That they are kept for horse that draw the chariots of kings,"
300,4,187,"Which horse, so deck’d, the charioteer esteems a grace to him;"
300,4,188,"Like these, in grace, the blood upon thy solid thighs did swim,"
300,4,189,"O Menelaus, down by calves and ankles to the ground."
300,4,190,"For nothing decks a soldier so, as doth an honour’d wound."
300,4,191,"Yet, fearing he had far’d much worse, the hair stood up on end"
300,4,192,"On Agamemnon, when he saw so much black blood descend."
300,4,193,"And stiff’ned with the like dismay was Menelaus too,"
300,4,194,"But seeing th’ arrow’s stale without, and that the head did go"
300,4,195,"No further than it might be seen, he call’d his spirits again;"
300,4,196,"Which Agamemnon marking not but thinking he was slain,"
300,4,197,"He grip’d his brother by the hand, and sigh’d as he would break,"
300,4,198,"Which sigh the whole host took from him, who thus at last did speak:"
300,4,199,"“O dearest brother, is’t for this, that thy death must be wrought,"
300,4,200,Wrought I this truce? For this has thou the single combat fought
300,4,201,"For all the army of the Greeks? For this hath Ilion sworn,"
300,4,202,And trod all faith beneath their feet? Yet all this hath not worn
300,4,203,The right we challeng’d out of force; this cannot render vain
300,4,204,"Our stricken right hands, sacred wine, nor all our off’rings slain;"
300,4,205,"For though Olympius be not quick in making good our ill,"
300,4,206,"He will be sure as he is slow, and sharplier prove his will."
300,4,207,"Their own hands shall be ministers of those plagues they despise,"
300,4,208,"Which shall their wives and children reach, and all their progenies."
300,4,209,"For both in mind and soul I know, that there shall come a day"
300,4,210,"When Ilion, Priam, all his pow’r, shall quite be worn away,"
300,4,211,"When heav’n - inhabiting Jove shall shake his fiery shield at all,"
300,4,212,"For this one mischief. This, I know, the world cannot recall."
300,4,213,"But be all this, all my grief still for thee will be the same,"
300,4,214,"Dear brother. If thy life must here put out his royal flame,"
300,4,215,I shall to sandy Argos turn with infamy my face;
300,4,216,And all the Greeks will call for home; old Priam and his race
300,4,217,Will flame in glory; Helena untouch’d be still their prey;
300,4,218,And thy bones in our enemies’ earth our curséd fates shall lay;
300,4,219,Thy sepulchre be trodden down; the pride of Troy desire
300,4,220,"Insulting on it, ‘Thus, O thus, let Agamemnon’s ire"
300,4,221,"In all his acts be expiate, as now he carries home"
300,4,222,"His idle army, empty ships, and leaves here overcome"
300,4,223,"Good Menelaus.’ When this rave breaks in their bated breath,"
300,4,224,"Then let the broad earth swallow me, and take me quick to death.”"
300,4,225,"“Nor shall this ever chance,” said he, “and therefore be of cheer,"
300,4,226,"Lest all the army, led by you, your passions put in fear."
300,4,227,"The arrow fell in no such place a death could enter at,"
300,4,228,"My girdle, curets doubled here, and my most trusted plate,"
300,4,229,"Objected all ’twixt me and death, the shaft scarce piercing one.”"
300,4,230,"“Good brother,” said the king, “I wish it were no further gone,"
300,4,231,"For then our best in med’cines skilled shall ope and search the wound,"
300,4,232,"Applying balms to ease thy pains, and soon restore thee sound.”"
300,4,233,"This said, divine Talthybiús he call’d, and bad him haste"
300,4,234,"Machaon (Æsculapius’ son, who most of men was grac’d"
300,4,235,With physic’s sov’reign remedies) to come and lend his hand
300,4,236,"To Menelaus, shot by one well - skill’d in the command"
300,4,237,"Of bow and arrows, one of Troy, or of the Lycian aid,"
300,4,238,"Who much hath glorified our foe, and us as much dismay’d."
300,4,239,"He heard, and hasted instantly, and cast his eyes about"
300,4,240,"The thickest squadrons of the Greeks, to find Machaon out."
300,4,241,He found him standing guarded well with well - arm’d men of Thrace;
300,4,242,"With whom he quickly join’d, and said: “Man of Apollo’s race,"
300,4,243,"Haste, for the king of men commands, to see a wound impress’d"
300,4,244,"In Menelaus, great in arms, by one instructed best"
300,4,245,"In th’ art of archery, of Troy, or of the Lycian bands,"
300,4,246,"That them with much renown adorns, us with dishonour brands.”"
300,4,247,"Machaon much was mov’d with this, who with the herald flew"
300,4,248,From troop to troop alongst the host; and soon they came in view
300,4,249,"Of hurt Atrides, circled round with all the Grecian kings;"
300,4,250,"Who all gave way, and straight he draws the shaft, which forth he"
300,4,251,brings
300,4,252,"Without the forks; the girdle then, plate, curets, off he plucks,"
300,4,253,"And views the wound; when first from it the clotter’d blood he sucks,"
300,4,254,"Then med’cines, wondrously compos’d, the skilful leech applied,"
300,4,255,"Which loving Chiron taught his sire, he from his sire had tried."
300,4,256,"While these were thus employ’d to ease the Atrean martialist,"
300,4,257,"The Trojans arm’d, and charg’d the Greeks; the Greeks arm and resist."
300,4,258,"Then not asleep, nor maz’d with fear, nor shifting off the blows,"
300,4,259,"You could behold the king of men, but in full speed he goes"
300,4,260,"To set a glorious fight on foot; and he examples this,"
300,4,261,"With toiling, like the worst, on foot; who therefore did dismiss"
300,4,262,"His brass - arm’d chariot, and his steeds, with Ptolemëus’ son,"
300,4,263,"Son of Piraides, their guide, the good Eurymedon;"
300,4,264,"“Yet,” said the king, “attend with them, lest weariness should seize"
300,4,265,"My limbs, surcharg’d with ord’ring troops so thick and vast as these.”"
300,4,266,"Eurymedon then rein’d his horse, that trotted neighing by;"
300,4,267,"The king a footman, and so scours the squadrons orderly."
300,4,268,"Those of his swiftly - mounted Greeks, that in their arms were fit,"
300,4,269,"Those he put on with cheerful words, and bad them not remit"
300,4,270,"The least spark of their forward spirits, because the Trojans durst"
300,4,271,"Take these abhorr’d advantages, but let them do their worst;"
300,4,272,"For they might be assur’d that Jove would patronise no lies,"
300,4,273,"And that who, with the breach of truce, would hurt their enemies,"
300,4,274,With vultures should be torn themselves; that they should raze their
300,4,275,"town,"
300,4,276,"Their wives, and children at their breast, led vassals to their own."
300,4,277,"But such as he beheld hang off from that increasing fight,"
300,4,278,"Such would he bitterly rebuke, and with disgrace excite:"
300,4,279,"“Base Argives, blush ye not to stand as made for butts to darts?"
300,4,280,"Why are ye thus discomfited, like hinds that have no hearts,"
300,4,281,"Who, wearied with a long - run field, are instantly emboss’d,"
300,4,282,"Stand still, and in their beastly breasts is all their courage lost?"
300,4,283,"And so stand you strook with amaze, nor dare to strike a stroke."
300,4,284,"Would ye the foe should nearer yet your dastard spleens provoke,"
300,4,285,"Ev’n where on Neptune’s foamy shore our navies lie in sight,"
300,4,286,"To see if Jove will hold your hands, and teach ye how to fight?”"
300,4,287,"Thus he, commanding, rang’d the host, and, passing many a band,"
300,4,288,"He came to the Cretensian troops, where all did arméd stand"
300,4,289,About the martial Idomen; who bravely stood before
300,4,290,"In vanguard of his troops, and match’d for strength a savage boar;"
300,4,291,"Meriones, his charioteer, the rearguard bringing on."
300,4,292,"Which seen to Atreus’ son, to him it was a sight alone,"
300,4,293,And Idomen’s confirméd mind with these kind words he seeks:
300,4,294,"“O Idomen! I ever lov’d thy self past all the Greeks,"
300,4,295,"In war, or any work of peace, at table, ev’rywhere;"
300,4,296,"For when the best of Greece besides mix ever, at our cheer,"
300,4,297,"My good old ardent wine with small, and our inferior mates"
300,4,298,"Drink ev’n that mix’d wine measur’d too, thou drink’st, without those"
300,4,299,"rates,"
300,4,300,"Our old wine neat, and evermore thy bowl stands full like mine,"
300,4,301,"To drink still when and what thou wilt. Then rouse that heart of thine,"
300,4,302,"And, whatsoever heretofore thou hast assum’d to be,"
300,4,303,This day be greater.” To the king in this sort answer’d he:
300,4,304,"“Atrides, what I ever seem’d, the same at ev’ry part"
300,4,305,"This day shall show me at the full, and I will fit thy heart."
300,4,306,"But thou shouldst rather cheer the rest, and tell them they in right"
300,4,307,"Of all good war must offer blows, and should begin the fight,"
300,4,308,(Since Troy first brake the holy truce) and not endure these braves.
300,4,309,"To take wrong first, and then be dar’d to the revenge it craves;"
300,4,310,"Assuring them that Troy in fate must have the worst at last,"
300,4,311,"Since first, and ’gainst a truce, they hurt, where they should have"
300,4,312,embrac’d.”
300,4,313,This comfort and advice did fit Atrides’ heart indeed
300,4,314,"Who still through new - rais’d swarms of men held his laborious speed,"
300,4,315,And came where both th’ Ajaces stood; whom like the last he found
300,4,316,"Arm’d, casqu’d, and ready for the fight. Behind them, hid the ground"
300,4,317,"A cloud of foot, that seem’d to smoke. And as a goatherd spies,"
300,4,318,"On some hill’s top, out of the sea a rainy vapour rise,"
300,4,319,"Driv’n by the breath of Zephyrus which, though far off he rest,"
300,4,320,"Comes on as black as pitch, and brings a tempest in his breast,"
300,4,321,"Whereat he frighted, drives his herds apace into a den;"
300,4,322,So dark’ning earth with darts and shields show’d these with all their
300,4,323,men.
300,4,324,"This sight with like joy fir’d the king, who thus let forth the flame"
300,4,325,"In crying out to both the dukes: “O you of equal name,"
300,4,326,"I must not cheer, nay, I disclaim all my command of you,"
300,4,327,"Yourselves command with such free minds, and make your soldiers show"
300,4,328,"As you nor I led, but themselves. O would our father Jove,"
300,4,329,"Minerva, and the God of Light, would all our bodies move"
300,4,330,"With such brave spirits as breathe in you, then Priam’s lofty town"
300,4,331,"Should soon be taken by our hands, for ever overthrown!”"
300,4,332,"Then held he on to other troops, and Nestor next beheld,"
300,4,333,"The subtle Pylian orator, range up and down the field"
300,4,334,"Embattelling his men at arms, and stirring all to blows,"
300,4,335,"Points ev’ry legion out his chief, and ev’ry chief he shows"
300,4,336,"The forms and discipline of war, yet his commanders were"
300,4,337,"All expert, and renownéd men. Great Pelagon was there,"
300,4,338,"Alastor, manly Chromius, and Hæmon worth a throne,"
300,4,339,And Bias that could armies lead. With these he first put on
300,4,340,His horse troops with their chariots; his foot (of which he choos’d
300,4,341,"Many, the best and ablest men, and which he ever us’d"
300,4,342,As rampire to his gen’ral pow’r) he in the rear dispos’d.
300,4,343,"The slothful, and the least of spirit, he in the midst inclos’d,"
300,4,344,"That, such as wanted noble wills, base need might force to stand."
300,4,345,"His horse troops, that the vanguard had, he strictly did command"
300,4,346,"To ride their horses temp’rately, to keep their ranks, and shun"
300,4,347,"Confusion, lest their horsemanship and courage made them run"
300,4,348,"(Too much presum’d on) much too far, and, charging so alone,"
300,4,349,"Engage themselves in th’ enemy’s strength, where many fight with one."
300,4,350,"“Who his own chariot leaves to range, let him not freely go,"
300,4,351,But straight unhorse him with a lance; for ’tis much better so.
300,4,352,"And with this discipline,” said he, “this form, these minds, this"
300,4,353,"trust,"
300,4,354,Our ancestors have walls and towns laid level with the dust.”
300,4,355,"Thus prompt, and long inur’d to arms, this old man did exhort;"
300,4,356,"And this Atrides likewise took in wondrous cheerful sort,"
300,4,357,"And said: “O father, would to heav’n, that as thy mind remains"
300,4,358,"In wonted vigour, so thy knees could undergo our pains!"
300,4,359,"But age, that all men overcomes, hath made his prise on thee;"
300,4,360,"Yet still I wish that some young man, grown old in mind, might be"
300,4,361,"Put in proportion with thy years, and thy mind, young in age,"
300,4,362,"Be fitly answer’d with his youth; that still where conflicts rage,"
300,4,363,"And young men us’d to thirst for fame, thy brave exampling hand"
300,4,364,"Might double our young Grecian spirits, and grace our whole command.”"
300,4,365,"The old knight answer’d: “I myself could wish, O Atreus’ son,"
300,4,366,"I were as young as when I slew brave Ereuthalion,"
300,4,367,But Gods at all times give not all their gifts to mortal men.
300,4,368,"If then I had the strength of youth, I miss’d the counsels then"
300,4,369,That years now give me; and now years want that main strength of youth;
300,4,370,Yet still my mind retains her strength (as you now said the sooth)
300,4,371,"And would be where that strength is us’d, affording counsel sage"
300,4,372,To stir youth’s minds up; ’tis the grace and office of our age;
300,4,373,"Let younger sinews, men sprung up whole ages after me,"
300,4,374,"And such as have strength, use it, and as strong in honour be.”"
300,4,375,"The king, all this while comforted, arriv’d next where he found"
300,4,376,"Well - rode Menestheus (Peteus’ son) stand still, inviron’d round"
300,4,377,"With his well - train’d Athenian troops, and next to him he spied"
300,4,378,"The wise Ulysses, deedless too, and all his bands beside"
300,4,379,Of strong Cephalians; for as yet th’ alarm had not been heard
300,4,380,"In all their quarters, Greece and Troy were then so newly stirr’d,"
300,4,381,"And then first mov’d, as they conceiv’d; and they so look’d about"
300,4,382,To see both hosts give proof of that they yet had cause to doubt.
300,4,383,"Atrides seeing them stand so still, and spend their eyes at gaze,"
300,4,384,"Began to chide: “And why,” said he, “dissolv’d thus in amaze,"
300,4,385,"Thou son of Peteus, Jove - nurs’d king, and thou in wicked sleight"
300,4,386,"A cunning soldier, stand ye off? Expect ye that the fight"
300,4,387,Should be by other men begun? ’Tis fit the foremost band
300,4,388,Should show you there; you first should front who first lifts up his
300,4,389,hand.
300,4,390,"First you can hear, when I invite the princes to a feast,"
300,4,391,"When first, most friendly, and at will, ye eat and drink the best,"
300,4,392,"Yet in the fight, most willingly, ten troops ye can behold"
300,4,393,"Take place before ye.” Ithacus at this his brows did fold,"
300,4,394,"And said: “How hath thy violent tongue broke through thy set of teeth,"
300,4,395,"To say that we are slack in fight, and to the field of death"
300,4,396,"Look others should enforce our way, when we were busied then,"
300,4,397,"Ev’n when thou spak’st, against the foe to cheer and lead our men?"
300,4,398,"But thy eyes shall be witnesses, if it content thy will,"
300,4,399,"And that (as thou pretend’st) these cares do so affect thee still,"
300,4,400,"The father of Telemachus (whom I esteem so dear,"
300,4,401,"And to whom, as a legacy, I’ll leave my deeds done here)"
300,4,402,"Ev’n with the foremost band of Troy hath his encounter dar’d,"
300,4,403,"And therefore are thy speeches vain, and had been better spar’d.”"
300,4,404,"He, smiling, since he saw him mov’d, recall’d his words, and said:"
300,4,405,"“Most generous Laertes’ son, most wise of all our aid,"
300,4,406,"I neither do accuse thy worth, more than thyself may hold"
300,4,407,"Fit, (that inferiors think not much, being slack, to be controll’d)"
300,4,408,Nor take I on me thy command; for well I know thy mind
300,4,409,"Knows how sweet gentle counsels are, and that thou stand’st inclin’d,"
300,4,410,"As I myself, for all our good. On then; if now we spake"
300,4,411,"What hath displeas’d, another time we full amends will make;"
300,4,412,"And Gods grant that thy virtue ere may prove so free and brave,"
300,4,413,"That my reproofs may still be vain, and thy deservings grave.”"
300,4,414,"Thus parted they; and forth he went, when he did leaning find,"
300,4,415,"Against his chariot, near his horse, him with the mighty mind,"
300,4,416,"Great Diomedes, Tydeus’ son, and Sthenelus, the seed"
300,4,417,"Of Capaneius; whom the king seeing likewise out of deed,"
300,4,418,Thus cried he out on Diomed: “O me! In what a fear
300,4,419,"The wise great warrior, Tydeus’ son, stands gazing ev’rywhere"
300,4,420,For others to begin the fight! It was not Tydeus’ use
300,4,421,"To be so daunted, whom his spirit would evermore produce"
300,4,422,"Before the foremost of his friends in these affairs of fright,"
300,4,423,As they report that have beheld him labour in a fight.
300,4,424,"For me, I never knew the man, nor in his presence came,"
300,4,425,"But excellent, above the rest, he was in gen’ral fame;"
300,4,426,"And one renown’d exploit of his, I am assur’d, is true."
300,4,427,"He came to the Mycenian court, without arms, and did sue,"
300,4,428,"At godlike Polynices’ hands, to have some worthy aid"
300,4,429,To their designs that ’gainst the walls of sacred Thebes were laid.
300,4,430,"He was great Polynices’ guest, and nobly entertain’d,"
300,4,431,"And of the kind Mycenian state what he requested gain’d,"
300,4,432,"In mere consent; but when they should the same in act approve,"
300,4,433,"By some sinister prodigies, held out to them by Jove,"
300,4,434,"They were discourag’d. Thence he went, and safely had his pass"
300,4,435,"Back to Asopus’ flood, renown’d for bulrushes and grass."
300,4,436,"Yet, once more, their ambassador, the Grecian peers address"
300,4,437,"Lord Tydeus to Eteocles; to whom being giv’n access,"
300,4,438,He found him feasting with a crew of Cadmeans in his hall;
300,4,439,"Amongst whom, though an enemy, and only one to all;"
300,4,440,"To all yet he his challenge made at ev’ry martial feat,"
300,4,441,"And eas’ly foil’d all, since with him Minerva was so great."
300,4,442,"The rank - rode Cadmeans, much incens’d with their so foul disgrace,"
300,4,443,"Lodg’d ambuscadoes for their foe, in some well - chosen place"
300,4,444,"By which he was to make return. Twice five - and - twenty men,"
300,4,445,"And two of them great captains too, the ambush did contain."
300,4,446,"The names of those two men of rule were Mæon, Hæmon’s son,"
300,4,447,"And Lycophontes, Keep - field call’d, the heir of Autophon,"
300,4,448,By all men honour’d like the Gods; yet these and all their friends
300,4,449,"Were sent to hell by Tydeus’ hand, and had untimely ends."
300,4,450,"He trusting to the aid of Gods, reveal’d by augury,"
300,4,451,"Obeying which, one chief he sav’d, and did his life apply"
300,4,452,To be the heavy messenger of all the others’ deaths;
300,4,453,"And that sad message, with his life, to Mæon he bequeaths."
300,4,454,"So brave a knight was Tydeüs of whom a son is sprung,"
300,4,455,"Inferior far in martial deeds, though higher in his tongue.”"
300,4,456,"All this Tydides silent heard, aw’d by the rev’rend king;"
300,4,457,"Which stung hot Sthenelus with wrath, who thus put forth his sting:"
300,4,458,"“Atrides, when thou know’st the truth, speak what thy knowledge is,"
300,4,459,"And do not lie so; for I know and I will brag in this,"
300,4,460,That we are far more able men than both our fathers were.
300,4,461,"We took the sev’n - fold ported Thebes, when yet we had not there"
300,4,462,"So great help as our fathers had; and fought beneath a wall,"
300,4,463,"Sacred to Mars, by help of Jove, and trusting to the fall"
300,4,464,"Of happy signs from other Gods, by whom we took the town"
300,4,465,Untouch’d; our fathers perishing here by follies of their own;
300,4,466,And therefore never more compare our fathers’ worth with ours.”
300,4,467,"Tydides frown’d at this, and said: “Suppress thine anger’s pow’rs,"
300,4,468,"Good friend, and hear why I refrain’d. Thou seest I am not mov’d"
300,4,469,"Against our gen’ral, since he did but what his place behov’d,"
300,4,470,"Admonishing all Greeks to fight; for, if Troy prove our prise,"
300,4,471,"The honour and the joy is his; if here our ruin lies,"
300,4,472,The shame and grief for that as much is his in greatest kinds.
300,4,473,"As he then his charge, weigh we ours; which is our dauntless minds.”"
300,4,474,"Thus, from his chariot, amply arm’d, he jump’d down to the ground;"
300,4,475,"The armour of the angry king so horribly did sound,"
300,4,476,It might have made his bravest foe let fear take down his braves.
300,4,477,"And as when with the west - wind flaws, the sea thrusts up her waves,"
300,4,478,"One after other, thick and high, upon the groaning shores,"
300,4,479,"First in herself loud, but oppos’d with banks and rocks she roars,"
300,4,480,"And, all her back in bristles set, spits ev’ry way her foam;"
300,4,481,"So, after Diomed, instantly the field was overcome"
300,4,482,With thick impressions of the Greeks; and all the noise that grew
300,4,483,(Ord’ring and cheering up their men) from only leaders flew.
300,4,484,"The rest went silently away, you could not hear a voice,"
300,4,485,"Nor would have thought, in all their breasts, they had one in their"
300,4,486,"choice,"
300,4,487,"Their silence uttering their awe of them that them controll’d,"
300,4,488,"Which made each man keep right his arms, march, fight still where he"
300,4,489,should
300,4,490,"The Trojans (like a sort of ewes, penn’d in a rich man’s fold,"
300,4,491,"Close at his door, till all be milk’d, and never baaing hold"
300,4,492,Hearing the bleating of their lambs) did all their wide host fill
300,4,493,"With shouts and clamours, nor observ’d one voice, one baaing still,"
300,4,494,But show’d mix’d tongues from many a land of men call’d to their aid.
300,4,495,"Rude Mars had th’ ordering of their spirits; of Greeks, the learned"
300,4,496,Maid
300,4,497,"But Terror follow’d both the hosts, and Flight, and furious Strife"
300,4,498,"The sister, and the mate, of Mars, that spoil of human life;"
300,4,499,"And never is her rage at rest, at first she is but small,"
300,4,500,"Yet after, but a little fed, she grows so vast and tall"
300,4,501,"That, while her feet move here in earth, her forehead is in heav’n;"
300,4,502,And this was she that made ev’n then both hosts so deadly giv’n.
300,4,503,"Through ev’ry troop she stalk’d, and stirr’d rough sighs up as she"
300,4,504,went;
300,4,505,"But when in one field both the foes her fury did content,"
300,4,506,"And both came under reach of darts, then darts and shields oppos’d"
300,4,507,To darts and shields; strength answer’d strength; then swords and
300,4,508,targets clos’d
300,4,509,With swords and targets; both with pikes; and then did tumult rise
300,4,510,Up to her height; then conqu’rors’ boasts mix’d with the conquer’d’s
300,4,511,cries;
300,4,512,"Earth flow’d with blood. And as from hills rainwaters headlong fall,"
300,4,513,"That all ways eat huge ruts, which, met in one bed, fill a vall"
300,4,514,"With such a confluence of streams, that on the mountain grounds"
300,4,515,"Far off, in frighted shepherds’ ears, the bustling noise rebounds:"
300,4,516,"So grew their conflicts, and so show’d their scuffling to the ear,"
300,4,517,"With flight and clamour still commix’d, and all effects of fear."
300,4,518,"And first renown’d Antilochus slew (fighting, in the face"
300,4,519,"Of all Achaia’s foremost bands, with an undaunted grace)"
300,4,520,Echepolus Thalysiades; he was an arméd man;
300,4,521,"Whom on his hair - plum’d helmet’s crest the dart first smote, then ran"
300,4,522,"Into his forehead, and there stuck; the steel pile making way"
300,4,523,Quite through his skull; a hasty night shut up his latest day.
300,4,524,"His fall was like a fight - rac’d tow’r; like which lying there dispread,"
300,4,525,"King Elephenor (who was son to Chalcodon, and led"
300,4,526,The valiant Abants) covetous that he might first possess
300,4,527,"His arms, laid hands upon his feet, and hal’d him from the press"
300,4,528,Of darts and jav’lins hurl’d at him. The action of the king
300,4,529,"When great - in - heart Agenor saw, he made his jav’lin sing"
300,4,530,"To th’ others’ labour; and along as he the trunk did wrest,"
300,4,531,His side (at which he bore his shield) in bowing of his breast
300,4,532,"Lay naked, and receiv’d the lance, that made him lose his hold"
300,4,533,"And life together; which, in hope of that he lost, he sold,"
300,4,534,"But for his sake the fight grew fierce, the Trojans and their foes"
300,4,535,"Like wolves on one another rush’d, and man for man it goes."
300,4,536,"The next of name, that serv’d his fate, great Ajax Telamon"
300,4,537,"Preferr’d so sadly. He was heir to old Anthemion,"
300,4,538,"And deck’d with all the flow’r of youth; the fruit of which yet fled,"
300,4,539,Before the honour’d nuptial torch could light him to his bed.
300,4,540,"His name was Simoisius; for, some few years before,"
300,4,541,"His mother walking down the hill of Ida, by the shore"
300,4,542,"Of silver Simois, to see her parents’ flocks, with them"
300,4,543,"She, feeling suddenly the pains of child - birth, by the stream"
300,4,544,Of that bright river brought him forth; and so (of Simois)
300,4,545,They call’d him Simoisius. Sweet was that birth of his
300,4,546,"To his kind parents, and his growth did all their care employ;"
300,4,547,"And yet those rites of piety, that should have been his joy"
300,4,548,"To pay their honour’d years again in as affectionate sort,"
300,4,549,"He could not graciously perform, his sweet life was so short,"
300,4,550,"Cut off with mighty Ajax’ lance; for, as his spirit put on,"
300,4,551,"He strook him at his breast’s right pap, quite through his"
300,4,552,"shoulder - bone,"
300,4,553,"And in the dust of earth he fell, that was the fruitful soil"
300,4,554,Of his friends’ hopes; but where he sow’d he buried all his toil.
300,4,555,"And as a poplar shot aloft, set by a river side,"
300,4,556,"In moist edge of a mighty fen, his head in curls implied,"
300,4,557,"But all his body plain and smooth, to which a wheel - wright puts"
300,4,558,"The sharp edge of his shining axe, and his soft timber cuts"
300,4,559,"From his in native root, in hope to hew out of his bole"
300,4,560,"The fell’ffs, or out - parts of a wheel, that compass in the whole,"
300,4,561,"To serve some goodly chariot; but, being big and sad,"
300,4,562,"And to be hal’d home through the bogs, the useful hope he had"
300,4,563,"Sticks there, and there the goodly plant lies with’ring out his grace:"
300,4,564,"So lay, by Jove - bred Ajax’ hand, Anthemion’s forward race,"
300,4,565,Nor could through that vast fen of toils be drawn to serve the ends
300,4,566,"Intended by his body’s pow’rs, nor cheer his aged friends."
300,4,567,"But now the gay - arm’d Antiphus, a son of Priam, threw"
300,4,568,"His lance at Ajax through the prease; which went by him, and flew"
300,4,569,"On Leucus, wise Ulysses’ friend; his groin it smote, as fain"
300,4,570,"He would have drawn into his spoil the carcass of the slain,"
300,4,571,"By which he fell, and that by him; it vex’d Ulysses’ heart,"
300,4,572,"Who thrust into the face of fight, well - arm’d at ev’ry part,"
300,4,573,"Came close, and look’d about to find an object worth his lance;"
300,4,574,"Which when the Trojans saw him shake, and he so near advance,"
300,4,575,"All shrunk; he threw, and forth it shin’d, nor fell but where it"
300,4,576,fell’d;
300,4,577,"His friend’s grief gave it angry pow’r, and deadly way it held"
300,4,578,"Upon Democoon, who was sprung of Priam’s wanton force,"
300,4,579,"Came from Abydus, and was made the master of his horse."
300,4,580,"Through both his temples strook the dart, the wood of one side shew’d,"
300,4,581,"The pile out of the other look’d, and so the earth he strew’d"
300,4,582,With much sound of his weighty arms. Then back the foremost went;
300,4,583,"Ev’n Hector yielded; then the Greeks gave worthy clamours vent,"
300,4,584,"Effecting then their first - dumb pow’rs; some drew the dead, and"
300,4,585,"spoil’d,"
300,4,586,"Some follow’d, that, in open flight, Troy might confess it foil’d."
300,4,587,"Apollo, angry at the sight, from top of Ilion cried:"
300,4,588,"“Turn head, ye well - rode peers of Troy, feed not the Grecians’ pride,"
300,4,589,"They are not charm’d against your points, of steel, nor iron, fram’d;"
300,4,590,"Nor fights the fair - hair’d Thetis’ son, but sits at fleet inflam’d.”"
300,4,591,"So spake the dreadful God from Troy. The Greeks, Jove’s noblest Seed"
300,4,592,"Encourag’d to keep on the chace; and, where fit spirit did need,"
300,4,593,"She gave it, marching in the midst. Then flew the fatal hour"
300,4,594,"Back on Diores, in return of Ilion’s sun - burn’d pow’r;"
300,4,595,"Diores Amaryncides, whose right leg’s ankle - bone,"
300,4,596,"And both the sinews, with a sharp and handful - charging stone"
300,4,597,"Pirus Imbrasides did break, that led the Thracian bands"
300,4,598,"And came from Ænos; down he fell, and up he held his hands"
300,4,599,To his lov’d friends; his spirit wing’d to fly out of his breast
300,4,600,"With which not satisfied, again Imbrasides address’d"
300,4,601,"His jav’lin at him, and so ripp’d his navel, that the wound,"
300,4,602,"As endlessly it shut his eyes, so, open’d, on the ground"
300,4,603,"It pour’d his entrails. As his foe went then suffic’d away,"
300,4,604,"Thoas Ætolius threw a dart, that did his pile convey,"
300,4,605,"Above his nipple, through his lungs; when, quitting his stern part,"
300,4,606,"He clos’d with him, and, from his breast first drawing out his dart,"
300,4,607,"His sword flew in, and by the midst it wip’d his belly out;"
300,4,608,"So took his life, but left his arms; his friends so flock’d about,"
300,4,609,"And thrust forth lances of such length before their slaughter’d king,"
300,4,610,"Which, though their foe were big and strong, and often brake the ring"
300,4,611,"Forg’d of their lances, yet (enforc’d) he left th’ affected prise."
300,4,612,"The Thracian and Epeian dukes, laid close with closéd eyes"
300,4,613,"By either other, drown’d in dust; and round about the plain,"
300,4,614,"All hid with slaughter’d carcasses, yet still did hotly reign"
300,4,615,"The martial planet; whose effects had any eye beheld,"
300,4,616,"Free and unwounded (and were led by Pallas through the field,"
300,4,617,"To keep off jav’lins, and suggest the least fault could be found)"
300,4,618,"He could not reprehend the fight, so many strew’d the ground."
300,4,619,THE END OF THE FOURTH BOOK.
300,4,620,[1] Virgil useth these verses.
300,5,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,5,2,King Diomed (by Pallas’ spirit inspir’d
300,5,3,"With will and pow’r) is for his acts admir’d,"
300,5,4,"Mere men, and men deriv’d from Deities,"
300,5,5,"And Deities themselves, he terrifies."
300,5,6,Adds wounds to terrors. His inflamed lance
300,5,7,"Draws blood from Mars, and Venus. In a trance"
300,5,8,"He casts Æneas, with a weighty stone;"
300,5,9,"Apollo quickens him, and gets him gone."
300,5,10,"Mars is recur’d by Pæon, but by Jove"
300,5,11,Rebuk’d for authoring breach of human love.
300,5,12,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,5,13,"In Epsilon, Heav’n’s blood is shed"
300,5,14,By sacred rage of Diomed.
300,5,15,Then Pallas breath’d in Tydeus’ son; to render whom supreme
300,5,16,"To all the Greeks, at all his parts, she cast a hotter beam"
300,5,17,"On his high mind, his body fill’d with much superior might,"
300,5,18,And made his cómplete armour cast a far more cómplete light.
300,5,19,"From his bright helm and shield did burn a most unwearied fire,[1]"
300,5,20,"Like rich Autumnus’ golden lamp, whose brightness men admire"
300,5,21,"Past all the other host of stars, when, with his cheerful face"
300,5,22,"Fresh wash’d in lofty Ocean waves, he doth the skies enchase."
300,5,23,"To let whose glory, lose no sight, still Pallas made him turn"
300,5,24,"Where tumult most express’d his pow’r, and where the fight did burn."
300,5,25,"An honest and a wealthy man inhabited in Troy,"
300,5,26,"Dares, the priest of Mulciber, who two sons did enjoy,"
300,5,27,"Idæus, and bold Phegeüs, well - seen in ev’ry fight."
300,5,28,"These (singled from their troops, and hors’d) assail’d Minerva’s"
300,5,29,"knight,"
300,5,30,"Who rang’d from fight to fight on foot. All hasting mutual charge,"
300,5,31,"And now drawn near, first Phegeus threw a jav’lin swift and large,"
300,5,32,"Whose head the king’s left shoulder took, but did no harm at all;"
300,5,33,"Then rush’d he out a lance at him, that had no idle fall,"
300,5,34,"But in his breast stuck ’twixt the paps, and strook him from his horse."
300,5,35,"Which stern sight when Idæus saw, distrustful of his force"
300,5,36,"To save his slaughter’d brother’s spoil, it made him headlong leap"
300,5,37,"From his fair chariot, and leave all; yet had not ’scap’d the heap"
300,5,38,"Of heavy fun’ral, if the God, great President of fire,"
300,5,39,Had not in sudden clouds of smoke and pity of his sire
300,5,40,"To leave him utterly unheir’d, giv’n safe pass to his feet."
300,5,41,"He gone, Tydides sent the horse and chariot to the fleet."
300,5,42,"The Trojans seeing Dares’ sons one slain, the other fled,"
300,5,43,Were strook amaz’d. The blue - ey’d Maid (to grace her Diomed
300,5,44,In giving free way to his pow’r) made this so ruthful fact
300,5,45,"A fit advantage to remove the War - god out of act,"
300,5,46,"Who rag’d so on the Ilion side. She grip’d his hand, and said:"
300,5,47,"“Mars, Mars, thou ruiner of men, that in the dust hast laid"
300,5,48,"So many cities, and with blood thy godhead dost distain,"
300,5,49,"Now shall we cease to show our breasts as passionate as men,"
300,5,50,"And leave the mixture of our hands, resigning Jove his right,"
300,5,51,"As Rector of the Gods, to give the glory of the fight"
300,5,52,"Where he affecteth, lest he force what he should freely yield?”"
300,5,53,"He held it fit, and went with her from the tumultuous field,"
300,5,54,Who set him in an herby seat on broad Scamander’s shore.
300,5,55,"He gone, all Troy was gone with him, the Greeks drave all before."
300,5,56,And ev’ry leader slew a man; but first the king of men
300,5,57,"Deserv’d the honour of his name, and led the slaughter then,"
300,5,58,"And slew a leader, one more huge than any man he led,"
300,5,59,"Great Odius, duke of Halizons; quite from his chariot’s head"
300,5,60,"He strook him with a lance to earth, as first he flight address’d;"
300,5,61,"It took his forward - turnéd back, and look’d out of his breast;"
300,5,62,"His huge trunk sounded, and his arms did echo the resound."
300,5,63,"Idomenæus to the death did noble Phæstus wound,"
300,5,64,"The son of Meon - Borus, that from cloddy Terna came;"
300,5,65,"Who, taking chariot, took his wound, and tumbled with the same"
300,5,66,"From his attempted seat: the lance through his right shoulder strook,"
300,5,67,And horrid darkness strook through him; the spoil his soldiers took.
300,5,68,"Atrides - Menelaus slew, as he before him fled,"
300,5,69,"Scamandrius, son of Strophius, that was a huntsman bred;"
300,5,70,"A skilful huntsman, for his skill Diana’s self did teach,"
300,5,71,And made him able with his dart infallibly to reach
300,5,72,"All sorts of subtlest savages, which many a woody hill"
300,5,73,"Bred for him, and he much preserv’d, and all to show his skill."
300,5,74,"Yet not the dart - delighting Queen taught him to shun this dart,"
300,5,75,"Nor all his hitting so far off, the mast’ry of his art;"
300,5,76,"His back receiv’d it, and he fell upon his breast withal;"
300,5,77,"His body’s ruin, and his arms, so sounded in his fall,"
300,5,78,"That his affrighted horse flew off, and left him, like his life."
300,5,79,"Meriones slew Phereclus, whom she that ne’er was wife,"
300,5,80,"Yet Goddess of good housewives, held in excellent respect"
300,5,81,"For knowing all the witty things that grace an architect,"
300,5,82,And having pow’r to give it all the cunning use of hand.
300,5,83,"Harmonides, his sire, built ships, and made him understand,"
300,5,84,"With all the practice it requir’d, the frame of all that skill."
300,5,85,"He built all Alexander’s ships, that author’d all the ill"
300,5,86,"Of all the Trojans and his own, because he did not know"
300,5,87,The oracles advising Troy (for fear of overthrow)
300,5,88,"To meddle with no sea affair, but live by tilling land."
300,5,89,"This man Meriones surpris’d, and drave his deadly hand"
300,5,90,Through his right hip; the lance’s head ran through the región
300,5,91,"About the bladder, underneath th’ in - muscles and the bone;"
300,5,92,"He, sighing, bow’d his knees to death, and sacrific’d to earth."
300,5,93,"Phylides stay’d Pedæus’ flight, Antenor’s bastard birth,"
300,5,94,"Whom virtuous Theano his wife, to please her husband, kept"
300,5,95,"As tenderly as those she lov’d. Phylides near him stept,"
300,5,96,"And in the fountain of the nerves did drench his fervent lance,"
300,5,97,"At his head’s back - part; and so far the sharp head did advance,"
300,5,98,"It cleft the organ of his speech, and th’ iron, cold as death,"
300,5,99,"He took betwixt his grinning teeth, and gave the air his breath."
300,5,100,"Eurypylus, the much renown’d, and great Evemon’s son,"
300,5,101,"Divine Hypsenor slew, begot by stout Dolopion,"
300,5,102,And consecrate Scamander’s priest; he had a God’s regard
300,5,103,"Amongst the people; his hard flight the Grecian follow’d hard,"
300,5,104,"Rush’d in so close, that with his sword he on his shoulder laid"
300,5,105,"A blow that his arm’s brawn cut off; nor there his vigour stay’d,"
300,5,106,"But drave down, and from off his wrist it hew’d his holy hand"
300,5,107,"That gush’d out blood, and down it dropp’d upon the blushing sand;"
300,5,108,"Death, with his purple finger, shut, and violent fate, his eyes."
300,5,109,"Thus fought these, but distinguish’d well. Tydides so implies"
300,5,110,His fury that you could not know whose side had interest
300,5,111,"In his free labours, Greece or Troy; but as a flood, increas’d"
300,5,112,"By violent and sudden show’rs, let down from hills, like hills"
300,5,113,"Melted in fury, swells and foams, and so he overfills"
300,5,114,His natural channel; that besides both hedge and bridge resigns
300,5,115,"To his rough confluence, far spread; and lusty flourishing vines"
300,5,116,"Drown’d in his outrage; Tydeus’ son so overran the field,"
300,5,117,"Strew’d such as flourish’d in his way, and made whole squadrons yield,"
300,5,118,"When Pandarus, Lycaon’s son, beheld his ruining hand,"
300,5,119,"With such resistless insolence, make lanes through ev’ry band,"
300,5,120,"He bent his gold - tipp’d bow of horn, and shot him rushing in,"
300,5,121,"At his right shoulder, where his arms were hollow; forth did spin"
300,5,122,"The blood, and down his curets ran; then Pandarus cried out:"
300,5,123,"“Rank - riding Trojans, now rush in. Now, now, I make no doubt:"
300,5,124,Our bravest foe is mark’d for death; he cannot long sustain
300,5,125,"My violent shaft, if Jove’s fair Son did worthily constrain"
300,5,126,"My foot from Lycia.” Thus he brav’d, and yet his violent shaft"
300,5,127,"Strook short with all his violence, Tydides’ life was saft;"
300,5,128,"Who yet withdrew himself behind his chariot and steeds,"
300,5,129,"And call’d to Sthenelus: “Come, friend, my wounded shoulder needs"
300,5,130,Thy hand to ease it of this shaft.” He hasted from his seat
300,5,131,"Before the coach, and drew the shaft; the purple wound did sweat,"
300,5,132,"And drown his shirt of mail in blood, and as it bled he pray’d:"
300,5,133,"“Hear me, of Jove - Ægiochus thou most unconquer’d Maid!"
300,5,134,If ever in the cruel field thou has assistful stood
300,5,135,"Or to my father, or myself, now love, and do me good."
300,5,136,"Give him into my lance’s reach, that thus hath giv’n a wound"
300,5,137,"To him thou guard’st, preventing me, and brags that never more"
300,5,138,I shall behold the cheerful sun.” Thus did the king implore.
300,5,139,"The Goddess heard, came near, and took the weariness of fight"
300,5,140,"From all his nerves and lineaments, and made them fresh and light,"
300,5,141,"And said: “Be bold, O Diomed, in ev’ry combat shine,"
300,5,142,"The great shield - shaker Tydeus’ strength (that knight, that sire of"
300,5,143,thine)
300,5,144,By my infusion breathes in thee; and from thy knowing mind
300,5,145,"I have remov’d those erring mists that made it lately blind,"
300,5,146,"That thou may’st diff’rence Gods from men, and therefore use thy skill"
300,5,147,"Against the tempting Deities, if any have a will"
300,5,148,"To try if thou presum’st of that, as thine, that flows from them,"
300,5,149,And so assum’st above thy right. Where thou discern’st a beam
300,5,150,"Of any other Heav’nly Pow’r than She that rules in love,"
300,5,151,"That calls thee to the change of blows, resist not, but remove;"
300,5,152,But if that Goddess be so bold (since she first stirr’d this war)
300,5,153,Assault and mark her from the rest with some infámous scar.”
300,5,154,"The blue - eyed Goddess vanishéd, and he was seen again"
300,5,155,"Amongst the foremost, who before though he were prompt and fain"
300,5,156,"To fight against the Trojans’ pow’rs, now, on his spirits were call’d"
300,5,157,"With thrice the vigour; lion - like, that hath been lately gall’d"
300,5,158,"By some bold shepherd in a field, where his curl’d flocks were laid,"
300,5,159,"Who took him as he leap’d the fold, not slain yet, but appaid"
300,5,160,"With greater spirit, comes again, and then the shepherd hides,"
300,5,161,"(The rather for the desolate place) and in his cot abides,"
300,5,162,"His flocks left guardless; which, amaz’d, shake and shrink up in heaps;"
300,5,163,"He, ruthless, freely takes his prey, and out again he leaps;"
300,5,164,"So sprightly, fierce, victorious, the great heroë flew"
300,5,165,"Upon the Trojans, and, at once, he two commanders slew,"
300,5,166,Hypenor and Astynous; in one his lance he fix’d
300,5,167,Full at the nipple of his breast; the other smote betwixt
300,5,168,"The neck and shoulder with his sword, which was so well laid on"
300,5,169,"It swept his arm and shoulder off. These left, he rush’d upon"
300,5,170,"Abas and Polyëidus, of old Eurydamas"
300,5,171,"The hapless sons; who could by dreams tell what would come to pass,"
300,5,172,"Yet, when his sons set forth to Troy, the old man could not read"
300,5,173,"By their dreams what would chance to them, for both were stricken dead"
300,5,174,"By great Tydides, After these, he takes into his rage"
300,5,175,"Xanthus and Thoön, Phænops’ sons, born to him in his age;"
300,5,176,"The good old man ev’n pin’d with years, and one son more"
300,5,177,"To heir his goods; yet Diomed took both, and left him store"
300,5,178,"Of tears and sorrows in their steads, since he could never see"
300,5,179,His sons leave those hot wars alive; so this the end must be
300,5,180,"Of all his labours; what he heap’d, to make his issue great,"
300,5,181,"Authority heir’d, and with her seed fill’d his forgotten seat."
300,5,182,"Then snatch’d he up two Priamists, that in one chariot stood,"
300,5,183,"Echemon, and fair Chromius. As feeding in a wood"
300,5,184,"Oxen or steers are, one of which a lion leaps upon,"
300,5,185,"Tears down, and wrings in two his neck; so, sternly, Tydeus’ son"
300,5,186,"Threw from their chariot both these hopes of old Dardanides,"
300,5,187,"Then took their arms, and sent their horse to those that ride the seas,"
300,5,188,"Æneas, seeing the troops thus toss’d, brake through the heat of fight,"
300,5,189,"And all the whizzing of the darts, to find the Lycian knight,"
300,5,190,"Lycaon’s son; whom having found, he thus bespake the peer;"
300,5,191,"“O Pandarus, where’s now thy bow, thy deathful arrows where,"
300,5,192,"In which no one in all our host but gives the palm to thee,"
300,5,193,"Nor in the sun - lov’d Lycian greens, that breed our archery,"
300,5,194,"Lives any that exceeds thyself? Come, lift thy hands to Jove,"
300,5,195,"And send an arrow at this man, if but a man he prove,"
300,5,196,"That wins such god - like victories, and now affects our host"
300,5,197,"With so much sorrow, since so much of our best blood is lost"
300,5,198,"By his high valour. I have fear some God in him doth threat,"
300,5,199,Incens’d for want of sacrifice; the wrath of God is great.”
300,5,200,"Lycaon’s famous son replied: “Great counsellor of Troy,"
300,5,201,"This man, so excellent in arms, I think is Tydeus’ joy;"
300,5,202,"I know him by his fi’ry shield, by his bright three - plum’d casque,"
300,5,203,"And by his horse; nor can I say, if or some God doth mask"
300,5,204,"In his appearance, or he be whom I nam’d Tydeus’ son,"
300,5,205,But without God the things he does for certain are not done.
300,5,206,"Some great Immortal, that conveys his shoulders in a cloud,"
300,5,207,"Goes by and puts by ev’ry dart at his bold breast bestow’d,"
300,5,208,Or lets it take with little hurt; for I myself let fly
300,5,209,"A shaft that shot him through his arms, but had as good gone by,"
300,5,210,Yet which I gloriously affirm’d had driv’n him down to hell.
300,5,211,"Some God is angry, and with me; for far hence, where I dwell,"
300,5,212,"My horse and chariots idle stand, with which some other way"
300,5,213,I might repair this shameful miss. Elev’n fair chariots stay
300,5,214,"In old Lycaon’s court, new made, new trimm’d to have been gone,"
300,5,215,"Curtain’d, and arrast under foot; two horse to ev’ry one,"
300,5,216,"That eat white barley and black oats, and do no good at all;"
300,5,217,And these Lycaon (that well knew how these affairs would fall)
300,5,218,"Charg’d, when I set down this design, I should command with here,"
300,5,219,"And gave me many lessons more, all which much better were"
300,5,220,Than any I took forth myself. The reason I laid down
300,5,221,"Was but the sparing of my horse, since in a siegéd town"
300,5,222,I thought our horse - meat would be scant; when they were us’d to have
300,5,223,"Their manger full; so I left them, and like a lackey slave"
300,5,224,"Am come to Ilion, confident in nothing but my bow"
300,5,225,That nothing profits me. Two shafts I vainly did bestow
300,5,226,"At two great princes, but of both my arrows neither slew,"
300,5,227,"Nor this, nor Atreus’ younger son; a little blood I drew,"
300,5,228,That serv’d but to incense them more. In an unhappy star
300,5,229,I therefore from my armoury have drawn those tools of war
300,5,230,"That day, when, for great Hector’s sake, to amiable Troy:"
300,5,231,"I came to lead the Trojan bands. But if I ever joy,"
300,5,232,"In safe return, my country’s sight, my wife’s, my lofty tow’rs,"
300,5,233,"Let any stranger take this head, if to the fi’ry Pow’rs"
300,5,234,"This bow, these shafts, in pieces burst, by these hands be not thrown;"
300,5,235,Idle companions that they are to me and my renown.”
300,5,236,"Æneas said: “Use no such words; for, any other way"
300,5,237,"Than this, they shall not now be us’d. We first will both assay"
300,5,238,"This man with horse and chariot. Come then, ascend to me,"
300,5,239,"That thou may’st try our Trojan horse, how skill’d in field they be,"
300,5,240,"And in pursuing those that fly, or flying, being pursued,"
300,5,241,"How excellent they are of foot; and these, if Jove conclude"
300,5,242,"The ’scape of Tydeüs again, and grace him with our flight,"
300,5,243,"Shall serve to bring us safely off. Come, I’ll be first shall fight,"
300,5,244,"Take thou these fair reins and this scourge; or, if thou wilt, fight"
300,5,245,"thou,"
300,5,246,And leave the horses’ care to me.” He answer’d: “I will now
300,5,247,"Descend to fight, keep thou the reins, and guide thyself thy horse;"
300,5,248,Who with their wonted manager will better wield the force
300,5,249,"Of the impulsive chariot, if we be driv’n to fly,"
300,5,250,"Than with a stranger; under whom they will be much more shy,"
300,5,251,"And, fearing my voice, wishing thine, grow resty, nor go on"
300,5,252,"To bear us off, but leave engag’d for mighty Tydeus’ son"
300,5,253,"Themselves and us. Then be thy part thy one - hoof’d horses’ guide,"
300,5,254,"I’ll make the fight, and with a dart receive his utmost pride.”"
300,5,255,"With this the gorgeous chariot both, thus prepar’d, ascend"
300,5,256,"And make full way at Diomed; which noted by his friend,"
300,5,257,"“Mine own most - lovéd mind,” said he, “two mighty men of war"
300,5,258,I see come with a purpos’d charge; one’s he that hits so far
300,5,259,"With bow and shaft, Lycaon’s son; the other fames the brood"
300,5,260,"Of great Anchises and the Queen that rules in amorous blood,"
300,5,261,"Æneas, excellent in arms. Come up, and use your steeds,"
300,5,262,"And look not war so in the face, lest that desire that feeds"
300,5,263,Thy great mind be the bane of it.” This did with anger sting
300,5,264,"The blood of Diomed, to see his friend, that chid the king"
300,5,265,"Before the fight, and then preferr’d his ablesse and his mind"
300,5,266,"To all his ancestors in fight, now come so far behind;"
300,5,267,"Whom thus he answer’d: “Urge no flight, you cannot please me so;"
300,5,268,"Nor is it honest in my mind to fear a coming foe,"
300,5,269,"Or make a flight good, though with fight. My pow’rs are yet entire,"
300,5,270,And scorn the help - tire of a horse. I will not blow the fire
300,5,271,"Of their hot valours with my flight, but cast upon the blaze"
300,5,272,This body borne upon my knees. I entertain amaze?
300,5,273,"Minerva will not see that shame. And since they have begun,"
300,5,274,"They shall not both elect their ends; and he that ’scapes shall  run,"
300,5,275,Or stay and take the other’s fate. And this I leave for thee; —
300,5,276,"If amply - wise Athenia give both their lives to me,"
300,5,277,"Rein our horse to their chariot hard, and have a special heed"
300,5,278,"To seize upon Æneas’ steeds, that we may change their breed,"
300,5,279,And make a Grecian race of them that have been long of Troy.
300,5,280,"For these are bred of those brave beasts which, for the lovely boy"
300,5,281,"That waits now on the cup of Jove, Jove, that far - seeing God,"
300,5,282,Gave Tros the king in recompense; the best that ever trod
300,5,283,"The sounding centre, underneath the morning and the sun."
300,5,284,"Anchises stole the breed of them; for, where their sires did run,"
300,5,285,"He closely put his mares to them, and never made it known"
300,5,286,"To him that heir’d them, who was then the king Laomedon."
300,5,287,"Six horses had he of that race, of which himself kept four,"
300,5,288,And gave the other two his son; and these are they that scour
300,5,289,"The field so bravely towards us, expert in charge and flight."
300,5,290,"If these we have the pow’r to take, our prise is exquisite,"
300,5,291,"And our renown will far exceed.” While these were talking thus,"
300,5,292,"The fir’d horse brought th’ assailants near, and thus spake Pandarus:"
300,5,293,"“Most suff’ring - minded Tydeus’ son, that hast of war the art,"
300,5,294,"My shaft, that strook thee, slew thee not, I now will prove a dart.”"
300,5,295,"This said, he shook, and then he threw, a lance, aloft and large,"
300,5,296,"That in Tydides’ curets stuck, quite driving through his targe;"
300,5,297,Then bray’d he out so wild a voice that all the field might hear:
300,5,298,"“Now have I reach’d thy root of life, and by thy death shall bear"
300,5,299,Our praise’s chief prise from the field.” Tydides undismay’d
300,5,300,"Replied: “Thou err’st, I am not touch’d; but more charge will be laid"
300,5,301,To both your lives before you part; at least the life of one
300,5,302,"Shall satiate the throat of Mars.” This said, his lance was gone,"
300,5,303,"Minerva led it to his face, which at his eye ran in,"
300,5,304,"And, as he stoop’d, strook through his jaws, his tongue’s root, and his"
300,5,305,chin.
300,5,306,"Down from the chariot he fell, his gay arms shin’d and rung,"
300,5,307,"The swift horse trembled, and his soul for ever charm’d his tongue."
300,5,308,"Æneas with his shield, and lance, leapt swiftly to his friend,"
300,5,309,"Afraid the Greeks would force his trunk; and that he did defend,"
300,5,310,"Bold as a lion of his strength; he hid him with his shield,"
300,5,311,"Shook round his lance, and horribly did threaten all the field"
300,5,312,"With death, if any durst make in. Tydides rais’d a stone"
300,5,313,"With his one hand, of wondrous weight, and pour’d it mainly on"
300,5,314,"The hip of Anchisiades, wherein the joint doth move"
300,5,315,"The thigh (’tis call’d the huckle - bone) which all in sherds it drove,"
300,5,316,"Brake both the nerves, and with the edge cut all the flesh away."
300,5,317,"It stagger’d him upon his knees, and made th’ heroë stay"
300,5,318,"His strook - blind temples on his hand, his elbow on the earth;"
300,5,319,"And there this prince of men had died, if She that gave him birth,"
300,5,320,"(Kiss’d by Anchises on the green, where his fair oxen fed)"
300,5,321,"Jove’s loving daughter, instantly had not about him spread"
300,5,322,"Her soft embraces, and convey’d within her heav’nly veil"
300,5,323,(Us’d as a rampire ’gainst all darts that did so hot assail)
300,5,324,"Her dear - lov’d issue from the field, Then Sthenelus in haste,"
300,5,325,"Rememb’ring what his friend advis’d, from forth the prease made fast"
300,5,326,"His own horse to their chariot, and presently laid hand"
300,5,327,Upon the lovely - coated horse Æneas did command.
300,5,328,"Which bringing to the wond’nng Greeks, he did their guard commend"
300,5,329,"To his belov’d Deipylus, who was his inward friend,"
300,5,330,"And, of his equals, one to whom he had most honour shown,"
300,5,331,That he might see them safe at fleet; then stept he to his own.
300,5,332,"With which he cheerfully made in to Tydeus’ mighty race,"
300,5,333,"He, mad with his great enemy’s rape, was hot in desp’rate chace"
300,5,334,"Of her that made it, with his lance, arm’d less with steel than spite,"
300,5,335,"Well knowing her no Deity that had to do in fight,"
300,5,336,"Minerva his great patroness, nor, She that raceth towns,"
300,5,337,"Bellona, but a goddess weak, and foe to men’s renowns."
300,5,338,"Her, through a world of fight pursu’d, at last he overtook,"
300,5,339,"And, thrusting up his ruthless lance, her heav’nly veil he strook"
300,5,340,"(That ev’n the Graces wrought themselves, at her divine command)"
300,5,341,"Quite through, and hurt the tender back of her delicious hand."
300,5,342,"The rude point piercing through her palm, forth flow’d th’ immortal"
300,5,343,blood;
300,5,344,"Blood, such as flows in blesséd Gods, that eat no human food,"
300,5,345,"Nor drink of our inflaming wine, and therefore bloodless are,"
300,5,346,"And call’d Immortals; out she cried, and could no longer bear"
300,5,347,"Her lov’d son; whom she cast from her, and in a sable cloud"
300,5,348,"Phœbus, receiving, hid him close from all the Grecian crowd,"
300,5,349,"Lest some of them should find his death. Away flew Venus then,"
300,5,350,"And after her cried Diomed: “Away, thou spoil of men,"
300,5,351,"Though sprung from all - preserving Jove, these hot encounters leave."
300,5,352,"Is’t not enough that silly dames thy sorc’ries should deceive,"
300,5,353,"Unless thou thrust into the war, and rob a soldier’s right?"
300,5,354,"I think a few of these assaults will make thee fear the fight,"
300,5,355,"Wherever thou shalt hear it nam’d.” She, sighing, went her way"
300,5,356,"Extremely griev’d, and with her griefs her beauties did decay,"
300,5,357,And black her ivory body grew. Then from a dewy mist
300,5,358,"Brake swift - foot Iris to her aid, from all the darts that hiss’d"
300,5,359,"At her quick rapture; and to Mars they took their plaintive course,"
300,5,360,"And found him on the fight’s left hand, by him his speedy horse,"
300,5,361,"And huge lance, lying in a fog. The Queen of all things fair"
300,5,362,"Her lovéd brother, on her knees, besought, with instant pray’r,"
300,5,363,His golden - riband - bound - man’d horse to lend her up to heav’n
300,5,364,"For she was much griev’d with a wound a mortal man had giv’n,"
300,5,365,"Tydides, that ’gainst Jove himself durst now advance his arm."
300,5,366,"He granted, and his chariot (perplex’d with her late harm)"
300,5,367,"She mounted, and her waggoness was She that paints the air."
300,5,368,"The horse she rein’d, and with a scourge importun’d their repair,"
300,5,369,"That of themselves out - flew the wind, and quickly they ascend"
300,5,370,"Olympus, high seat of the Gods. Th’ horse knew their journey’s end,"
300,5,371,"Stood still, and from their chariot the windy - footed dame"
300,5,372,"Dissolv’d, and gave them heav’nly food; and to Dione came"
300,5,373,"Her wounded daughter, bent her knees. She kindly bade her stand,"
300,5,374,"With sweet embraces help’d her up, strok’d her with her soft hand,"
300,5,375,"Call’d kindly by her name, and ask’d: “What God hath been so rude,"
300,5,376,"Sweet daughter, to chastise thee thus, as if thou wert pursu’d"
300,5,377,"Ev’n to the act of some light sin, and deprehended so?"
300,5,378,"For otherwise, each close escape is in the great let go.”"
300,5,379,"She answer’d: “Haughty Tydeus’ son hath been so insolent,"
300,5,380,"Since, him whom most my heart esteems of all my lov’d descent,"
300,5,381,I rescu’d from his bloody hand. Now battle is not giv’n
300,5,382,"To any Trojans by the Greeks, but by the Greeks to heav’n.”"
300,5,383,"She answer’d: “Daughter, think not much, though much it grieve thee;"
300,5,384,use
300,5,385,"The patience, whereof many Gods examples may produce,"
300,5,386,"In many bitter ills receiv’d, as well that men sustain"
300,5,387,By their inflictions as by men repaid to them again.
300,5,388,"Mars suffer’d much more than thyself by Ephialtes’ pow’r,"
300,5,389,"And Otus’, Aloëus’ sons; who in a brazen tow’r,"
300,5,390,"And in inextricable chains, cast that war - greedy God,"
300,5,391,"Where twice - six months and one he liv’d, and there the period"
300,5,392,"Of his sad life perhaps had clos’d, if his kind step - dame’s eye,"
300,5,393,"Fair Erebæa, had not seen; who told it Mercury,"
300,5,394,And he by stealth enfranchis’d him; though he could scarce enjoy
300,5,395,"The benefit of franchisement, the chains did so destroy"
300,5,396,His vital forces with their weight. So Juno suffer’d more
300,5,397,"When, with a three - fork’d arrow’s head, Amphitryo’s son did gore"
300,5,398,"Her right breast, past all hope of cure. Pluto sustain’d no less"
300,5,399,"By that self man, and by a shaft of equal bitterness"
300,5,400,"Shot through his shoulder at hell gates; and there, amongst the dead,"
300,5,401,"Were he not deathless, he had died; but up to heav’n he fled,"
300,5,402,"Extremely tortur’d, for recure, which instantly he won"
300,5,403,"At Pæon’s hand, with sov’reign balm; and this did Jove’s great son,"
300,5,404,"Unblest, great - high - deed - daring man, that car’d not doing ill,"
300,5,405,"That with his bow durst wound the Gods! But, by Minerva’s will,"
300,5,406,Thy wound the foolish Diomed was so profane to give;
300,5,407,"Not knowing he that fights with Heav’n hath never long to live,"
300,5,408,"And for this deed, he never shall have child about his knee"
300,5,409,"To call him father, coming home. Besides, hear this from me,"
300,5,410,"Strength - trusting man, though thou be strong, and art in strength a"
300,5,411,"tow’r,"
300,5,412,"Take heed a stronger meet thee not, and that a woman’s pow’r"
300,5,413,"Contains not that superior strength, and lest that woman be"
300,5,414,"Adrastus’ daughter, and thy wife, the wise Ægiale;"
300,5,415,"When, from this hour not far, she wakes, ev’n sighing with desire"
300,5,416,"To kindle our revenge on thee, with her enamouring fire,"
300,5,417,"In choosing her some fresh young friend, and so drown all thy fame,"
300,5,418,"Won here in war, in her court - piece, and in an opener shame.”"
300,5,419,"This said, with both her hands she cleans’d the tender back and palm"
300,5,420,"Of all the sacred blood they lost; and, never using balm,"
300,5,421,"The pain ceas’d, and the wound was cur’d of this kind Queen of love."
300,5,422,"Juno and Pallas, seeing this, assay’d to anger Jove,"
300,5,423,"And quit his late - made mirth with them, about the loving Dame,"
300,5,424,"With some sharp jest, in like sort, built upon her present shame."
300,5,425,"Gray - ey’d Athenia began, and ask’d the Thunderer,"
300,5,426,"If, nothing moving him to wrath, she boldly might prefer,"
300,5,427,"What she conceiv’d, to his conceit; and, staying no reply,"
300,5,428,"She bade him view the Cyprian fruit he lov’d so tenderly,"
300,5,429,"Whom she thought hurt, and by this means; — intending to suborn"
300,5,430,Some other lady of the Greeks (whom lovely veils adorn)
300,5,431,"To gratify some other friend of her much - lovéd Troy,"
300,5,432,"As she embrac’d and stirr’d her blood to the Venerean joy,"
300,5,433,"The golden clasp, those Grecian dames upon their girdles wear,"
300,5,434,"Took hold of her delicious hand, and hurt it, she had fear."
300,5,435,"The Thund’rer smil’d, and call’d to him love’s golden Arbitress,"
300,5,436,And told her those rough works of war were not for her access;
300,5,437,"She should be making marriages, embracings, kisses, charms,"
300,5,438,Stern Mars and Pallas had the charge of those affairs in arms.
300,5,439,"While these thus talk’d, Tydides’ rage still thirsted to achieve"
300,5,440,"His prise upon Anchises’ son, though well he did perceive"
300,5,441,The Sun himself protected him; but his desires (inflam’d
300,5,442,"With that great Trojan prince’s blood, and arms so highly fam’d)"
300,5,443,"Not that great God did reverence. Thrice rush’d he rudely on,"
300,5,444,"And thrice, betwixt his darts and death, the Sun’s bright target shone;"
300,5,445,"But when upon the fourth assault, much like a spirit, he flew,"
300,5,446,"The far - off - working Deity exceeding wrathful grew,"
300,5,447,And ask’d him: “What! Not yield to gods? Thy equals learn to know.
300,5,448,The race of Gods is far above men creeping here below.”
300,5,449,This drave him to some small retreat; he would not tempt more near
300,5,450,The wrath of him that strook so far; whose pow’r had now set clear
300,5,451,Æneas from the stormy field within the holy place
300,5,452,"Of Pergamus, where, to the hope of his so sov’reign grace,"
300,5,453,A goodly temple was advanc’d; in whose large inmost part
300,5,454,"He left him, and to his supply inclin’d his mother’s heart,"
300,5,455,"Latona, and the dart - pleas’d Queen; who cur’d, and made him strong."
300,5,456,The silver - bow’d fair God then threw in the tumultuous throng
300,5,457,"An image, that in stature, look, and arms, he did create"
300,5,458,"Like Venus’ son; for which the Greeks and Trojans made debate,"
300,5,459,"Laid loud strokes on their ox - hide shields, and bucklers eas’ly borne;"
300,5,460,Which error Phœbus pleas’d to urge on Mars himself in scorn:
300,5,461,"“Mars, Mars,” said he, “thou plague of men, smear’d with the dust and"
300,5,462,blood
300,5,463,"Of humans, and their ruin’d walls, yet thinks thy Godhead good"
300,5,464,"To fright this fury from the field, who next will fight with Jove?"
300,5,465,"First in a bold approach he hurt, the moist palm of thy love,"
300,5,466,"And next, as if he did affect to have a Deity’s pow’r,"
300,5,467,"He held out his assault on me.” This said, the lofty tow’r"
300,5,468,Of Pergamus he made his seat; and Mars did now excite
300,5,469,"The Trojan forces, in the form of him that led to fight"
300,5,470,"The Thracian troops, swift Acamas. “O Priam’s sons,” said he,"
300,5,471,“How long the slaughter of your men can ye sustain to see?
300,5,472,Ev’n till they brave you at your gates? Ye suffer beaten down
300,5,473,"Æneas, great Anchises’ son, whose prowess we renown"
300,5,474,As much as Hector’s; fetch him off from this contentious prease.”
300,5,475,"With this, the strength and spirits of all his courage did increase;"
300,5,476,"And yet Sarpedon seconds him, with this particular taunt"
300,5,477,"Of noble Hector: “Hector, where is thy unthankful vaunt,"
300,5,478,"And that huge strength on which it built, that thou, and thy allies,"
300,5,479,"With all thy brothers (without aid of us or our supplies,"
300,5,480,And troubling not a citizen) the city safe would hold?
300,5,481,"In all which friends’ and brothers’ helps I see not, nor am told"
300,5,482,"Of anyone of their exploits, but (all held in dismay"
300,5,483,"Of Diomed, like a sort of dogs, that at a lion bay,"
300,5,484,"And entertain no spirit to pinch) we, your assistants here,"
300,5,485,"Fight for the town as you help’d us; and I, an aiding peer,"
300,5,486,"No citizen, ev’n out of care, that doth become a man"
300,5,487,"For men and children’s liberties, add all the aid I can;"
300,5,488,"Not out of my particular cause; far hence my profit grows,"
300,5,489,"For far hence Asian Lycia lies, where gulfy Xanthus flows,"
300,5,490,"And where my lov’d wife, infant son, and treasure nothing scant,"
300,5,491,"I left behind me, which I see those men would have that want,"
300,5,492,"And therefore they that have would keep. Yet I, as I would lose"
300,5,493,"Their sure fruition, cheer my troops, and with their lives propose"
300,5,494,"Mine own life, both to gen’ral fight, and to particular cope"
300,5,495,"With this great soldier; though, I say, I entertain no hope"
300,5,496,"To have such gettings as the Greeks, nor fear to lose like Troy."
300,5,497,"Yet thou, ev’n Hector, deedless stand’st, and car’st not to employ"
300,5,498,"Thy town - born friends, to bid them stand, to fight and save their"
300,5,499,"wives,"
300,5,500,Lest as a fowler casts his nets upon the silly lives
300,5,501,"Of birds of all sorts, so the foe your walls and houses hales,"
300,5,502,"One with another, on all heads; or such as ’scape their falls,"
300,5,503,He made the prey and prise of them (as willing overthrown)
300,5,504,That hope not for you with their force; and so this brave - built town
300,5,505,"Will prove a chaos. That deserves in thee so hot a care,"
300,5,506,"As should consume thy days and nights, to hearten and prepare"
300,5,507,Th’ assistant princes; pray their minds to bear their far - brought
300,5,508,toils;
300,5,509,To give them worth with worthy fight; in victories and foils
300,5,510,"Still to be equal; and thyself, exampling them in all,"
300,5,511,Need no reproofs nor spurs. All this in thy free choice should fall.”
300,5,512,"This stung great Hector’s heart; and yet, as ev’ry gen’rous mind"
300,5,513,"Should silent bear a just reproof, and show what good they find"
300,5,514,"In worthy counsels, by their ends put into present deeds,"
300,5,515,"Not stomach nor be vainly sham’d; so Hector’s spirit proceeds,"
300,5,516,"And from his chariot, wholly arm’d, he jump’d upon the sand,"
300,5,517,"On foot so toiling through the host, a dart in either hand,"
300,5,518,And all hands turn’d against the Greeks. The Greeks despis’d their
300,5,519,"worst,"
300,5,520,"And, thick’ning their instructed pow’rs, expected all they durst."
300,5,521,"Then with the feet of horse and foot, the dust in clouds did rise."
300,5,522,"And as, in sacred floors of barns, upon corn - winnow’rs flies"
300,5,523,"The chaff, driv’n with an opposite wind, when yellow Ceres dites,"
300,5,524,"Which all the diters’ feet, legs, arms, their heads and shoulders"
300,5,525,whites;
300,5,526,"So look’d the Grecians gray with dust, that strook the solid heav’n,"
300,5,527,"Rais’d from returning chariots, and troops together driv’n."
300,5,528,Each side stood to their labours firm. Fierce Mars flew through the
300,5,529,"air,"
300,5,530,"And gather’d darkness from the fight, and, with his best affair,"
300,5,531,"Obey’d the pleasure of the Sun, that wears the golden sword"
300,5,532,"Who bade him raise the spirits of Troy, when Pallas ceas’d t’ afford"
300,5,533,"Her helping office to the Greeks; and then his own hands wrought,"
300,5,534,"Which, from his fane’s rich chancel, cur’d, the true Æneas brought,"
300,5,535,And plac’d him by his peers in field; who did with joy admire
300,5,536,"To see him both alive and safe, and all his pow’rs entire"
300,5,537,"Yet stood not sifting how it chanc’d; another sort of task,"
300,5,538,"Then stirring th’ idle sieve of news, did all their forces ask,"
300,5,539,"Inflam’d by Phœbus, harmful Mars, and Eris eag’rer far."
300,5,540,The Greeks had none to hearten them; their hearts rose with the war;
300,5,541,"But chiefly Diomed, Ithacus, and both th’ Ajaces us’d"
300,5,542,Stirring examples and good words; their own fames had infus’d
300,5,543,"Spirit enough into their bloods, to make them neither fear"
300,5,544,"The Trojans’ force, nor Fate itself, but still expecting were,"
300,5,545,"When most was done, what would be more; their ground they still made good,"
300,5,546,"And in their silence, and set pow’rs, like fair still clouds, they"
300,5,547,"stood,"
300,5,548,"With which Jove crowns the tops of hills, in any quiet day,"
300,5,549,When Boreas and the ruder winds (that use to drive away
300,5,550,"Air’s dusky vapours, being loose, in many a whistling gale)"
300,5,551,"Are pleasingly bound up, and calm, and not a breath exhale;"
300,5,552,"So firmly stood the Greeks, nor fled for all the Ilion’s aid."
300,5,553,"Atrides yet coasts through the troops, confirming men so staid:"
300,5,554,"“O friends,” said he, “hold up your minds; strength is but strength of will;"
300,5,555,Rev’rence each other’s good in fight and shame at things done ill.
300,5,556,"Where soldiers show an honest shame, and love of honour lives,"
300,5,557,"That ranks men with the first in fight, death fewer liveries gives"
300,5,558,"Than life, or than where Fame’s neglect makes cowards fight at length."
300,5,559,"Flight neither doth the body grace, nor shows the mind hath strength.”"
300,5,560,"He said, and swiftly through the troops a mortal lance did send,"
300,5,561,"That reft a standard - bearer’s life, renown’d Æneas’ friend,"
300,5,562,"Deïcoon Pergasides, whom all the Trojans lov’d"
300,5,563,"As he were one of Priam’s sons, his mind was so approv’d"
300,5,564,"In always fighting with the first. The lance his target took,"
300,5,565,"Which could not interrupt the blow, that through it clearly strook,"
300,5,566,"And in his belly’s rim was sheath’d, beneath his girdle - stead."
300,5,567,"He sounded falling, and his arms with him resounded, dead."
300,5,568,"Then fell two princes of the Greeks by great Æneas’ ire,"
300,5,569,"Diocleus’ sons (Orsilochus and Crethon), whose kind sire"
300,5,570,"In bravely - builded Phæra dwelt, rich, and of sacred blood."
300,5,571,"He was descended lineally from great Alphæus’ flood,"
300,5,572,That broadly flows through Pyles’ fields; Alphæus did beget
300,5,573,"Orsilochus, who in the rule of many men was set;"
300,5,574,And that Orsilochus begat the rich Diocleüs;
300,5,575,"Diocleus sire to Crethon was, and this Orsilochus."
300,5,576,"Both these; arriv’d at man’s estate, with both th’ Atrides went,"
300,5,577,"To honour them in th’ Ilion wars; and both were one day sent,"
300,5,578,"To death as well as Troy, for death hid both in one black hour."
300,5,579,"As two young lions (with their dam, sustain’d but to devour)"
300,5,580,"Bred on the tops of some steep hill, and in the gloomy deep"
300,5,581,"Of an inaccessible wood, rush out, and prey on sheep,"
300,5,582,"Steers, oxen, and destroy men’s stalls, so long that they come short,"
300,5,583,And by the owner’s steel are slain; in such unhappy sort
300,5,584,Fell these beneath Æneas’ pow’r. When Menelaus view’d
300,5,585,"Like two tall fir - trees these two fall, their timeless falls he rued,"
300,5,586,"And to the first fight, where they lay, a vengeful force he took;"
300,5,587,"His arms beat back the sun in flames, a dreadful lance he shook;"
300,5,588,"Mars put the fury in his mind, that by Æneas’ hands,"
300,5,589,"Who was to make the slaughter good, he might have strew’d the sands."
300,5,590,"Antilochus, old Nestor’s son, observing he was bent"
300,5,591,"To urge a combat of such odds, and knowing, the event"
300,5,592,"Being ill on his part, all their pains (alone sustain’d for him)"
300,5,593,"Err’d from their end, made after hard, and took them in the trim"
300,5,594,"Of an encounter. Both their hands and darts advanc’d, and shook,"
300,5,595,And both pitch’d in full stand of charge; when suddenly the look
300,5,596,"Of Anchisiades took note of Nestor’s valiant son,"
300,5,597,"In full charge too; which, two to one, made Venus’ issue shun"
300,5,598,"The hot adventure, though he were a soldier well - approv’d."
300,5,599,Then drew they off their slaughter’d friends; who giv’n to their
300,5,600,"belov’d,"
300,5,601,They turn’d where fight show’d deadliest hate; and there mix’d with the
300,5,602,dead
300,5,603,"Pylæmen, that the targeteers of Paphlagonia led,"
300,5,604,A man like Mars; and with him fell good Mydon that did guide
300,5,605,"His chariot, Atymnus’ son. The prince Pylæmen died"
300,5,606,By Menelaus; Nestor’s joy slew Mydon; one before
300,5,607,The other in the chariot. Atrides’ lance did gore
300,5,608,"Pylæmen’s shoulder, in the blade. Antilochus did force"
300,5,609,"A mighty stone up from the earth, and, as he turn’d his horse,"
300,5,610,Strook Mydon’s elbow in the midst; the reins of ivory
300,5,611,Fell from his hands into the dust; Antilochus let fly
300,5,612,"His sword withal, and, rushing in, a blow so deadly laid"
300,5,613,"Upon his temples, that he groan’d, tumbled to earth, and stay’d"
300,5,614,A mighty while preposterously (because the dust was deep)
300,5,615,"Upon his neck and shoulders there, ev’n till his foe took keep"
300,5,616,"Of his pris’d horse, and made them stir; and then he prostrate fell."
300,5,617,"His horse Antilochus took home. When Hector had heard tell,"
300,5,618,"Amongst the uproar, of their deaths, he laid out all his voice,"
300,5,619,"And ran upon the Greeks. Behind came many men of choice,"
300,5,620,"Before him march’d great Mars himself match’d with his female mate,"
300,5,621,"The dread Bellona. She brought on, to fight for mutual fate,"
300,5,622,"A tumult that was wild and mad. He shook a horrid lance,"
300,5,623,"And now led Hector, and anon behind would make the chance."
300,5,624,"This sight when great Tydides saw, his hair stood up on end;"
300,5,625,"And him, whom all the skill and pow’r of arms did late attend,"
300,5,626,"Now like a man in counsel poor, that, travelling, goes amiss,"
300,5,627,"And having pass’d a boundless plain, not knowing where he is,"
300,5,628,"Comes on the sudden where he sees a river rough, and raves"
300,5,629,"With his own billows ravishéd into the king of waves,"
300,5,630,"Murmurs with foam, and frights him back; so he, amaz’d, retir’d,"
300,5,631,"And thus would make good his amaze: “O friends, we all admir’d"
300,5,632,"Great Hector, as one of himself, well - darting, bold in war,"
300,5,633,"When some God guards him still from death, and makes him dare so far."
300,5,634,"Now Mars himself, form’d like a man, is present in his rage,"
300,5,635,"And therefore, whatsoever cause importunes you to wage"
300,5,636,"War with these Trojans, never strive, but gently take your rod,"
300,5,637,"Lest in your bosoms, for a man, ye ever find a God.”"
300,5,638,"As Greece retir’d, the pow’r of Troy did much more forward prease,"
300,5,639,And Hector two brave men of war sent to the fields of peace;
300,5,640,"Menesthes, and Anchialus; one chariot bare them both."
300,5,641,"Their falls made Ajax Telamon ruthful of heart, and wroth"
300,5,642,"Who lighten’d out a lance that smote Amphius Selages,"
300,5,643,"That dwelt in Pæsos, rich in lands, and did huge goods possess,"
300,5,644,"But Fate, to Priam and his sons, conducted his supply."
300,5,645,"The jav’lin on his girdle strook, and piercéd mortally"
300,5,646,"His belly’s lower part; he fell: his arms had looks so trim,"
300,5,647,That Ajax needs would prove their spoil; the Trojans pour’d on him
300,5,648,"Whole storms of lances, large, and sharp, of which a number stuck"
300,5,649,"In his rough shield; yet from the slain he did his jav’lin pluck,"
300,5,650,"But could not from his shoulders force the arms he did affect,"
300,5,651,The Trojans with such drifts of darts the body did protect;
300,5,652,"And wisely Telamonius fear’d their valorous defence,"
300,5,653,"So many, and so strong of hand, stood in with such expense"
300,5,654,"Of deadly prowess; who repell’d, though big, strong, bold, he were,"
300,5,655,"The famous Ajax, and their friend did from his rapture bear."
300,5,656,Thus this place fill’d with strength of fight; in th’ army’s other
300,5,657,"prease,"
300,5,658,"Tlepolemus, a tall big man, the son of Hercules,"
300,5,659,"A cruel destiny inspir’d, with strong desire to prove"
300,5,660,"Encounter with Sarpedon’s strength, the son of cloudy Jove;"
300,5,661,"Who, coming on to that stern end, had chosen him his foe."
300,5,662,"Thus Jove’s great nephew, and his son, ’gainst one another go."
300,5,663,"Tlepolemus, to make his end more worth the will of fate,"
300,5,664,"Began as if he had her pow’r, and show’d the mortal state"
300,5,665,"Of too much confidence in man, with this superfluous brave:"
300,5,666,"“Sarpedon, what necessity or needless humour drave"
300,5,667,"Thy form to these wars, which in heart I know thou dost abhor,"
300,5,668,"A man not seen in deeds of arms, a Lycian counsellor?"
300,5,669,"They lie that call thee son to Jove, since Jove bred none so late;"
300,5,670,"The men of elder times were they, that his high pow’r begat,"
300,5,671,Such men as had Herculean force. My father Hercules
300,5,672,Was Jove’s true issue; he was bold; his deeds did well express
300,5,673,"They sprung out of a lion’s heart. He whilome came to Troy,"
300,5,674,"(For horse that Jupiter gave Tros, for Ganymed, his boy)"
300,5,675,"With six ships only, and few men, and tore the city down,"
300,5,676,"Left all her broad ways desolate, and made the horse his own."
300,5,677,"For thee, thy mind is ill dispos’d, thy body’s pow’rs are poor,"
300,5,678,And therefore are thy troops so weak; the soldier evermore
300,5,679,Follows the temper of his chief; and thou pull’st down a side.
300,5,680,"But say thou art the son of Jove, and hast thy means supplied"
300,5,681,"With forces fitting his descent, the pow’rs that I compel"
300,5,682,"Shall throw thee hence, and make thy head run ope the gates of hell.”"
300,5,683,"Jove’s Lycian issue answer’d him: “Tlepolemus, ’tis true"
300,5,684,Thy father holy Ilion in that sort overthrew;
300,5,685,"Th’ injustice of the king was cause, that, where thy father had"
300,5,686,"Us’d good deservings to his state, he quitted him with bad."
300,5,687,"Hesione, the joy and grace of king Laomedon,"
300,5,688,"Thy father rescu’d from a whale, and gave to Telamon"
300,5,689,"In honour’d nuptials (Telamon, from whom your strongest Greek"
300,5,690,Boasts to have issu’d) and this grace might well expect the like;
300,5,691,"Yet he gave taunts for thanks, and kept, against his oath, his horse,"
300,5,692,"And therefore both thy father’s strength, and justice, might enforce"
300,5,693,The wreak he took on Troy; but this and thy cause differ far.
300,5,694,Sons seldom heir their fathers’ worths. Thou canst not make his war.
300,5,695,"What thou assum’st for him, is mine, to be on thee impos’d.”"
300,5,696,"With this, he threw an ashen dart; and then Tlepolemus los’d"
300,5,697,"Another from his glorious hand. Both at one instant flew,"
300,5,698,"Both strook, both wounded. From his neck Sarpedon’s jav’lin drew"
300,5,699,The life blood of Tlepolemus; full in the midst it fell;
300,5,700,"And what he threaten’d, th’ other gave, that darkness, and that hell."
300,5,701,"Sarpedon’s left thigh took the lance; it pierc’d the solid bone,"
300,5,702,And with his raging head ran through; but Jove preserv’d his son.
300,5,703,"The dart yet vex’d him bitterly, which should have been pull’d out,"
300,5,704,"But none consider’d then so much, so thick came on the rout,"
300,5,705,And fill’d each hand so full of cause to ply his own defence;
300,5,706,"‘Twas held enough, both fall’n that both were nobly carried thence"
300,5,707,"Ulysses knew th’ events of both, and took it much to heart"
300,5,708,That his friend’s enemy should ’scape; and in a twofold part
300,5,709,"His thoughts contended, if he should pursue Sarpedon’s life,"
300,5,710,"Or take his friend’s wreak on his men. Fate did conclude this strife,"
300,5,711,By whom ’twas otherwise decreed than that Ulysses’ steel
300,5,712,Should end Sarpedon. In this doubt Minerva took the wheel
300,5,713,"From fickle Chance, and made his mind resolve to right his friend"
300,5,714,With that blood he could surest draw. Then did Revenge extend
300,5,715,Her full pow’r on the multitude; then did he never miss;
300,5,716,"Alastor, Halius, Chromius, Noemon, Prytanis,"
300,5,717,"Alcander, and a number more, he slew, and more had slain,"
300,5,718,"If Hector had not understood; whose pow’r made in amain,"
300,5,719,"And strook fear through the Grecian troops, but to Sarpedon gave"
300,5,720,"Hope of full rescue, who thus cried: “O Hector! Help and save"
300,5,721,"My body from the spoil of Greece, that to your lovéd town"
300,5,722,"My friends may see me borne, and then let earth possess her own"
300,5,723,"In this soil, for whose sake I left my country’s; for no day"
300,5,724,"Shall ever show me that again, nor to my wife display,"
300,5,725,"And young hope of my name, the joy of my much thirsted sight;"
300,5,726,"All which I left for Troy, for them let Troy then do this right.”"
300,5,727,"To all this Hector gives no word, but greedily he strives"
300,5,728,"With all speed to repel the Greeks, and shed in floods their lives,"
300,5,729,And left Sarpedon; but what face soever he put on
300,5,730,"Of following the common cause, he left this prince alone"
300,5,731,"For his particular grudge, because, so late, he was so plain"
300,5,732,"In his reproof before the host, and that did he retain;"
300,5,733,"However, for example sake, he would not show it then,"
300,5,734,"And for his shame too, since ’twas just. But good Sarpedon’s men"
300,5,735,"Ventur’d themselves, and forc’d him off, and set him underneath"
300,5,736,"The goodly beech of Jupiter, where now they did unsheath"
300,5,737,"The ashen lance; strong Pelagon, his friend, most lov’d, most true,"
300,5,738,"Enforc’d it from his maiméd thigh; with which his spirit flew,"
300,5,739,"And darkness over - flew his eyes; yet with a gentle gale,"
300,5,740,"That round about the dying prince cool Boreas did exhale,"
300,5,741,"He was reviv’d, recomforted, that else had griev’d and died."
300,5,742,"All this time flight drave to the fleet the Argives, who applied"
300,5,743,"No weapon ’gainst the proud pursuit, nor ever turn’d a head,"
300,5,744,"They knew so well that Mars pursu’d, and dreadful Hector led."
300,5,745,"Then who was first, who last, whose lives the iron Mars did seize,"
300,5,746,"And Priam’s Hector? Helenus, surnam’d Œnopides;"
300,5,747,"Good Teuthras; and Orestes, skill’d in managing of horse;"
300,5,748,"Bold Œnomaus; and a man renown’d for martial force,"
300,5,749,"Trechus, the great Ætolian chief; Oresbius, that did wear"
300,5,750,"The gaudy mitre, studied wealth extremely, and dwelt near"
300,5,751,"Th’ Atlantic lake Cephisides, in Hyla, by whose seat"
300,5,752,"The good men of Bœotia dwelt. This slaughter grew so great,"
300,5,753,"It flew to heav’n; Saturnia discern’d it, and cried out"
300,5,754,"To Pallas: “O unworthy sight! To see a field so fought,"
300,5,755,"And break our words to Sparta’s king, that Ilion should be rac’d,"
300,5,756,"And he return reveng’d; when thus we see his Greeks disgrac’d,"
300,5,757,"And bear the harmful rage of Mars! Come, let us use our care,"
300,5,758,That we dishonour not our pow’rs.” Minerva was as yare
300,5,759,As she at the despite of Troy. Her golden - bridled steeds
300,5,760,"Then Saturn’s daughter brought abroad; and Hebe, she proceeds"
300,5,761,"T’ address her chariot; instantly she gives it either wheel,"
300,5,762,Beam’d with eight spokes of sounding brass; the axle - tree was steel;
300,5,763,"The fell’ffs incorruptible gold, their upper bands of brass,"
300,5,764,"Their matter most unvalued, their work of wondrous grace;"
300,5,765,"The naves, in which the spokes were driv’n, were all with silver bound;"
300,5,766,"The chariot’s seat two hoops of gold and silver strengthen’d round,"
300,5,767,"Edg’d with a gold and silver fringe; the beam, that look’d before,"
300,5,768,"Was massy silver; on whose top, gears all of gold it wore,"
300,5,769,"And golden poitrils. Juno mounts, and her hot horses rein’d,"
300,5,770,"That thirsted for contentión, and still of peace complain’d."
300,5,771,"Minerva wrapt her in the robe, that curiously she wove,"
300,5,772,"With glorious colours, as she sate on th’ azure floor of Jove,"
300,5,773,"And wore the arms that he puts on, bent to the tearful field."
300,5,774,"About her broad - spread shoulders hung his huge and horrid shield,"
300,5,775,Fring’d round with ever - fighting snakes; through it was drawn to life
300,5,776,"The miseries and deaths of fight; in it frown’d bloody Strife,"
300,5,777,"In it shin’d sacred Fortitude, in it fell Púrsuit flew,"
300,5,778,"In it the monster Gorgon’s head, in which held out to view"
300,5,779,Were all the dire ostents of Jove; on her big head she plac’d
300,5,780,"His four - plum’d glitt’ring casque of gold, so admirably vast"
300,5,781,It would an hundred garrisons of soldiers comprehend.
300,5,782,Then to her shining chariot her vig’rous feet ascend;
300,5,783,"And in her violent hand she takes his grave, huge, solid lance,"
300,5,784,"With which the conquests of her wrath she useth to advance,"
300,5,785,"And overturn whole fields of men, to show she was the Seed"
300,5,786,"Of him that thunders. Then heav’n’s Queen, to urge her horses’ speed,"
300,5,787,"Takes up the scourge, and forth they fly. The ample gates of heav’n"
300,5,788,"Rung, and flew open of themselves; the charge whereof is giv’n,"
300,5,789,"With all Olympus, and the sky, to the distinguish’d Hours,"
300,5,790,"That clear, or hide it all in clouds, or pour it down in show’rs."
300,5,791,"This way their scourge - obeying horse made haste, and soon they won"
300,5,792,"The top of all the topful heav’ns, where aged Saturn’s son"
300,5,793,Sat sever’d from the other Gods; then stay’d the white - arm’d Queen
300,5,794,"Her steeds, and ask’d of Jove, if Mars did not incense his spleen"
300,5,795,"With his foul deeds, in ruining so many and so great"
300,5,796,"In the command and grace of Greece, and in so rude a heat?"
300,5,797,"At which, she said, Apollo laugh’d, and Venus, who still sue"
300,5,798,"To that mad God, for violence that never justice knew;"
300,5,799,"For whose impiety, she ask’d, if, with his wishéd love,"
300,5,800,Herself might free the field of him? He bade her rather move
300,5,801,"Athenia to the charge she sought, who us’d of old to be"
300,5,802,"The bane of Mars, and had as well the gift of spoil as he."
300,5,803,"This grace she slack’d not, but her horse scourg’d, that in nature flew"
300,5,804,Betwixt the cope of stars and earth; and how far at a view
300,5,805,"A man into the purple sea may from a hill descry,"
300,5,806,So far a high - neighing horse of heav’n at ev’ry jump would fly.[2]
300,5,807,"Arriv’d at Troy, where, broke in curls, the two floods mix their force,"
300,5,808,"Scamander and bright Simois, Saturnia stay’d her horse,"
300,5,809,"Took them from chariot, and a cloud of mighty depth diffus’d"
300,5,810,About them; and the verdant banks of Simois produc’d
300,5,811,In nature what they eat in heav’n. Then both the Goddesses[3]
300,5,812,"March’d, like a pair of tim’rous doves, in hasting their access"
300,5,813,"To th’ Argive succour. Being arriv’d, where both the most and best"
300,5,814,"Were heap’d together (showing all, like lions at a feast"
300,5,815,"Of new - slain carcasses, or boars, beyond encounter strong)"
300,5,816,"There found they Diomed; and there, ’midst all th’ admiring throng,"
300,5,817,"Saturnia put on Stentor’s shape, that had a brazen voice,"
300,5,818,"And spake as loud as fifty men; like whom she made a noise,"
300,5,819,"And chid the Argives: “O ye Greeks, in name and outward rite"
300,5,820,"But princes only, not in act, what scandal, what despite,"
300,5,821,Use ye to honour! All the time the great Æacides
300,5,822,"Was conversant in arms, your foes durst not a foot address"
300,5,823,"Without their ports, so much they fear’d his lance that all controll’d,"
300,5,824,And now they outray to your fleet.” This did with shame make bold
300,5,825,"The gen’ral spirit and pow’r of Greece: when, with particular note"
300,5,826,"Of their disgrace, Athenia made Tydeus’ issue hot."
300,5,827,"She found him at his chariot, refreshing of his wound"
300,5,828,"Inflicted by slain Pandarus; his sweat did so abound,"
300,5,829,"It much annoy’d him, underneath the broad belt of his shield;"
300,5,830,"With which, and tiréd with his toil, his soul could hardly yield"
300,5,831,"His body motion. With his hand he lifted up the belt,"
300,5,832,And wip’d away that clotter’d blood the fervent wound did melt.
300,5,833,"Minerva lean’d against his horse, and near their withers laid"
300,5,834,"Her sacred hand, then spake to him: “Believe me, Diomed,"
300,5,835,"Tydeus exampled not himself in thee his son; not great,"
300,5,836,"But yet he was a soldier; a man of so much heat,"
300,5,837,"That in his ambassy for Thebes, when I forbad his mind"
300,5,838,"To be too vent’rous, and when feasts his heart might have declin’d,"
300,5,839,"With which they welcom’d him, he made a challenge to the best,"
300,5,840,"And foil’d the best; I gave him aid, because the rust of rest,"
300,5,841,"That would have seiz’d another mind, he suffer’d not, but us’d"
300,5,842,"The trial I made like a man, and their soft feasts refus’d."
300,5,843,"Yet, when I set thee on, thou faint’st; I guard thee, charge, exhort"
300,5,844,"That, I abetting thee, thou shouldst be to the Greeks a fort,"
300,5,845,"And a dismay to Ilion, yet thou obey’st in nought,"
300,5,846,"Afraid, or slothful, or else both; henceforth renounce all thought"
300,5,847,That ever thou wert Tydeus’ son.” He answer’d her: “I know
300,5,848,"Thou art Jove’s daughter, and, for that, in all just duty owe"
300,5,849,"Thy speeches rev’rence, yet affirm ingeniously that fear"
300,5,850,"Doth neither hold me spiritless, nor sloth. I only bear"
300,5,851,"Thy charge in zealous memory, that I should never war"
300,5,852,"With any blesséd Deity, unless (exceeding far"
300,5,853,"The limits of her rule) the Queen, that governs chamber sport,"
300,5,854,Should press to field; and her thy will enjoin’d my lance to hurt.
300,5,855,"But, He whose pow’r hath right in arms, I knew in person here,"
300,5,856,"Besides the Cyprian Deity; and therefore did forbear,"
300,5,857,"And here have gather’d in retreat these other Greeks you see,"
300,5,858,"With note and rev’rence of your charge.” “My dearest mind,” said she,"
300,5,859,"“What then was fit is chang’d. ’Tis true, Mars hath just rule in war,"
300,5,860,"But just war; otherwise he raves, not fights. He’s alter’d far."
300,5,861,"He vow’d to Juno, and myself, that his aid should be us’d"
300,5,862,"Against the Trojans, whom it guards; and therein he abus’d"
300,5,863,"His rule in arms, infring’d his word, and made his war unjust."
300,5,864,"He is inconstant, impious, mad. Resolve then; firmly trust"
300,5,865,"My aid of thee against his worst, or any Deity;"
300,5,866,"Add scourge to thy free horse, charge home; he fights perfidiously.”"
300,5,867,"This said; as that brave king, her knight, with his horse - guiding"
300,5,868,"friend,"
300,5,869,"Were set before the chariot, for sign he should descend,"
300,5,870,"That she might serve for waggoness, she pluck’d the wagg’ner back,"
300,5,871,And up into his seat she mounts; the beechen tree did crack
300,5,872,"Beneath the burthen; and good cause, it bore so huge a thing,"
300,5,873,"A Goddess so replete with pow’r, and such a puissant king."
300,5,874,"She snatch’d the scourge up and the reins, and shut her heaven’ly look"
300,5,875,In Hell’s vast helm from Mars’s eyes; and full career she took
300,5,876,"At him, who then had newly slain the mighty Periphas,"
300,5,877,"Renown’d son to Ochesius, and far the strongest was"
300,5,878,Of all th’ Ætolians; to whose spoil the bloody God was run.
300,5,879,"But when this man - plague saw the approach of god - like Tydeus’ son,"
300,5,880,"He let his mighty Periphas lie, and in full charge he ran"
300,5,881,"At Diomed; and he at him. Both near; the God began,"
300,5,882,"And, thirsty of his blood, he throws a brazen lance that bears"
300,5,883,"Full on the breast of Diomed, above the reins and gears;"
300,5,884,"But Pallas took it on her hand, and strook the eager lance"
300,5,885,"Beneath the chariot. Then the knight of Pallas doth advance,"
300,5,886,"And cast a jav’lin off at Mars, Minerva sent it on,"
300,5,887,"That, where his arming girdle gilt, his belly graz’d upon,"
300,5,888,"Just at the rim, and ranch’d the flesh; the lance again he got,"
300,5,889,"But left the wound, that stung him so, he laid out such a throat"
300,5,890,As if nine or ten thousand men had bray’d out all their breaths
300,5,891,"In one confusion, having felt as many sudden deaths."
300,5,892,The roar made both the hosts amaz’d. Up flew the God to heav’n;
300,5,893,And with him was through all the air as black a tincture driv’n
300,5,894,"To Diomed’s eyes, as when the earth half - choked with smoking heat"
300,5,895,"Of gloomy clouds, that stifle men, and pitchy tempests threat,"
300,5,896,"Usher’d with horrid gusts of wind; with such black vapours plum’d,"
300,5,897,"Mars flew t’ Olympus, and broad heav’n, and there his place resum’d."
300,5,898,"Sadly he went and sat by Jove, show’d his immortal blood,"
300,5,899,"That from a mortal - man - made wound pour’d such an impious flood,"
300,5,900,"And weeping pour’d out these complaints: “O Father, storms’t thou not"
300,5,901,To see us take these wrongs from men? Extreme griefs we have got
300,5,902,"Ev’n by our own deep councils, held for gratifying them;"
300,5,903,"And thou, our council’s president, conclud’st in this extreme"
300,5,904,Of fighting ever; being rul’d by one that thou hast bred;
300,5,905,"One never well, but doing ill; a girl so full of head"
300,5,906,"That, though all other Gods obey, her mad moods must command,"
300,5,907,"By thy indulgence, nor by word, nor any touch of hand,"
300,5,908,"Correcting her; thy reason is, she is a spark of thee,"
300,5,909,"And therefore she may kindle rage in men ’gainst Gods, and she"
300,5,910,"May make men hurt Gods, and those Gods that are besides thy seed."
300,5,911,First in the palm’s hit Cyprides; then runs the impious deed
300,5,912,"On my hurt person; and, could life give way to death in me,"
300,5,913,"Or had my feet not fetched me off, heaps of mortality"
300,5,914,"Had kept me consort.” Jupiter, with a contracted brow,"
300,5,915,"Thus answered Mars: “Thou many minds, inconstant changeling thou,"
300,5,916,"Sit not complaining thus by me, whom most of all the Gods,"
300,5,917,"Inhabiting the starry hill, I hate; no periods"
300,5,918,"Being set to thy contentions, brawls, fights, and pitching fields;"
300,5,919,"Just of thy mother Juno’s moods, stiff - neck’d, and never yields,"
300,5,920,"Though I correct her still, and chide, nor can forbear offence,"
300,5,921,Though to her son; this wound I know tastes of her insolence;
300,5,922,"But I will prove more natural; thou shalt be cur’d, because"
300,5,923,"Thou com’st of me, but hadst thou been so cross to sacred laws,"
300,5,924,"Being born to any other God, thou had’st been thrown from heav’n"
300,5,925,"Long since, as low as Tartarus, beneath the giants driv’n.”"
300,5,926,"This said, he gave his wound in charge to Pæon, who applied"
300,5,927,"Such sov’reign med’cines, that as soon the pain was qualified,"
300,5,928,"And he recur’d; as nourishing milk, when runnet is put in,"
300,5,929,"Runs all in heaps of tough thick curd, though in his nature thin,"
300,5,930,Ev’n so soon his wound’s parted sides ran close in his recure;
300,5,931,"For he, all deathless, could not long the parts of death endure,"
300,5,932,"Then Hebe bath’d, and put on him fresh garments, and he sate"
300,5,933,"Exulting by his sire again, in top of all his state."
300,5,934,"So, having, from the spoils of men, made his desir’d remove,"
300,5,935,Juno and Pallas re - ascend the starry court of Jove.
300,5,936,THE END OF THE FIFTH BOOK.
300,5,937,[1] This simile likewise Virgil learns of him.
300,5,938,[2] How far a heavenly horse took at one reach or stroke in galloping
300,5,939,or running; wherein Homer’s mind is far from being expressed in his
300,5,940,"interpreters, all taking it for how far Deities were borne from the"
300,5,941,"earth, when instantly they came down to earth: _τόσσον ἐπιθρώσκουσι,_"
300,5,942,"etc. _tantun uno saltu conficiunt, vel, tantum subsultim"
300,5,943,"progrediuntur, deorum altizoni equi, etc. uno_ being understood, and"
300,5,944,"the horse’s swiftness highly expressed. The sense, otherwise, is"
300,5,945,senseless and contradictory.
300,5,946,"[3] ᾽Αμβροσίην is the original word, which Scaliger taxeth very"
300,5,947,"learnedly, asking how the horse came by it on those banks, when the"
300,5,948,text tells him Simois produced it; being willing to express by
300,5,949,"hyperbole the delicacy of that soil. If not, I hope the Deities could"
300,5,950,ever command it.
300,6,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,6,2,"The Gods now leaving an indiff’rent field,"
300,6,3,"The Greeks prevail, the slaughter’d Trojans yield."
300,6,4,"Hector, by Helenus’ advice, retires"
300,6,5,"In haste to Troy, and Hecuba desires"
300,6,6,To pray Minerva to remove from fight
300,6,7,"The son of Tydeus, her affected knight,"
300,6,8,"And vow to her, for favour of such price,"
300,6,9,Twelve oxen should be slain in sacrifice.
300,6,10,In mean space Glaucus and Tydides meet;
300,6,11,And either other with remembrance greet
300,6,12,"Of old love ’twixt their fathers, which inclines"
300,6,13,Their hearts to friendship; who change arms for signs
300,6,14,Of a continu’d love for either’s life.
300,6,15,"Hector, in his return, meets with his wife,"
300,6,16,"And, taking in his armed arms his son,"
300,6,17,He prophesies the fall of Ilion.
300,6,18,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,6,19,"In Zeta, Hector prophesies;"
300,6,20,Prays for his son; wills sacrifice.
300,6,21,"The stern fight freed of all the Gods, conquest with doubtful wings"
300,6,22,Flew on their lances; ev’ry way the restless field she flings
300,6,23,"Betwixt the floods of Simois and Xanthus, that confin’d"
300,6,24,"All their affairs of Ilion, and round about them shin’d."
300,6,25,"The first that weigh’d down all the field, of one particular side,"
300,6,26,"Was Ajax, son of Telamon; who, like a bulwark, plied"
300,6,27,"The Greeks’ protection, and of Troy the knotty orders brake,"
300,6,28,"Held out a light to all the rest, and showed them how to make"
300,6,29,"Way to their conquest, He did wound the strongest man of Thrace,"
300,6,30,"The tallest and the biggest set, Eussorian Acamas;"
300,6,31,"His lance fell on his casque’s plum’d top, in stooping; the fell head"
300,6,32,Drave through his forehead to his jaws; his eyes night shadowéd.
300,6,33,"Tydides slew Teuthranides Axylus, that did dwell,"
300,6,34,"In fair Arisba’s well - built tow’rs. He had of wealth a well,"
300,6,35,And yet was kind and bountiful; he would a traveller pray
300,6,36,"To be his guest, his friendly house stood in the broad highway,"
300,6,37,In which he all sorts nobly us’d; yet none of them would stand
300,6,38,"‘Twixt him and death, but both himself, and he that had command"
300,6,39,"Of his fair horse, Calesius, fell lifeless on the ground."
300,6,40,"Euryalus, Opheltius and Dresus dead did wound;"
300,6,41,"Nor ended there his fi’ry course, which he again begins,"
300,6,42,"And ran to it successfully, upon a pair of twins,"
300,6,43,"Æsepus, and bold Pedasus, whom good Bucolion"
300,6,44,"(That first call’d father, though base - born, renown’d Laomedon)"
300,6,45,"On Nais Abarbaræa got, a nymph that, as she fed"
300,6,46,"Her curléd flocks, Bucolion woo’d, and mix’d in love and bed."
300,6,47,"Both these were spoiled of arms and life, by Mecistiades."
300,6,48,"Then Polypœtes, for stern death, Astyalus did seize;"
300,6,49,Ulysses slew Percosius; Teucer Aretaön;
300,6,50,Antilochus (old Nestor’s joy) Ablerus; the great son
300,6,51,"Of Atreüs, and king of men, Elatus, whose abode:"
300,6,52,"He held at upper Pedasus, where Satnius’ river flowed;"
300,6,53,The great heroë Leitus stay’d Phylacus in flight
300,6,54,"From further life; Eurypylus, Melanthius reft of light."
300,6,55,"The brother to the king of men, Adrestus took alive;"
300,6,56,"Whose horse, affrighted with the flight, their driver now did drive"
300,6,57,"Amongst the low - grown tam’risk trees, and at an arm of one"
300,6,58,"The chariot in the draught - tree brake; the horse brake loose, and ron"
300,6,59,"The same way other flyers fled, contending all to town;"
300,6,60,"Himself close at the chariot wheel, upon his face was thrown,"
300,6,61,"And there lay flat, rolled up in dust. Atrides inwards drave;"
300,6,62,"And, holding at his breast his lance, Adrestus sought to save"
300,6,63,"His head by losing of his feet, and trusting to his knees;"
300,6,64,"On which the same parts of the king he hugs, and offers fees"
300,6,65,"Of worthy value for his life, and thus pleads their receipt:"
300,6,66,"“Take me alive, O Atreus’ son, and take a worthy weight"
300,6,67,"Of brass, elab’rate iron, and gold.[1] A heap of precious things"
300,6,68,"Are in my father’s riches hid, which, when your servant brings"
300,6,69,"News of my safety to his ears, he largely will divide"
300,6,70,"With your rare bounties.” Atreus’ son thought this the better side,"
300,6,71,"And meant to take it, being about to send him safe to fleet;"
300,6,72,"Which when, far off, his brother saw, he wing’d his royal feet,"
300,6,73,"And came in threat’ning, crying out: “O soft heart! What’s the cause"
300,6,74,Thou spar’st these men thus? Have not they observ’d these gentle laws
300,6,75,"Of mild humanity to thee, with mighty argument"
300,6,76,"Why thou shouldst deal thus; in thy house, and with all precedent"
300,6,77,"Of honour’d guest - rites, entertain’d? Not one of them shall fly"
300,6,78,"A bitter end for it from heav’n, and much less, dotingly,"
300,6,79,"‘Scape our revengeful fingers; all, ev’n th’ infant in the womb,"
300,6,80,"Shall taste of what they merited, and have no other tomb"
300,6,81,Than razéd Ilion; nor their race have more fruit than the dust.”
300,6,82,"This just cause turn’d his brother’s mind, who violently thrust"
300,6,83,The pris’ner from him; in whose guts the king of men impress’d
300,6,84,"His ashen lance, which (pitching down his foot upon the breast"
300,6,85,Of him that upwards fell) he drew; then Nestor spake to all:
300,6,86,"“O friends, and household men of Mars, let not your púrsuit fall,"
300,6,87,"With those ye fell, for present spoil; nor, like the king of men,"
300,6,88,"Let any ’scape unfell’d; but on, dispatch them all, and then"
300,6,89,"Ye shall have time enough to spoil.” This made so strong their chace,"
300,6,90,"That all the Trojans had been hous’d, and never turned a face,"
300,6,91,"Had not the Priamist Helenus, an augur most of name,"
300,6,92,Will’d Hector and Æneas thus: “Hector! Anchises’ fame!
300,6,93,"Since on your shoulders, with good cause, the weighty burden lies"
300,6,94,Of Troy and Lycia (being both of noblest faculties
300,6,95,"For counsel, strength of hand, and apt to take chance at her best"
300,6,96,"In ev’ry turn she makes) stand fast, and suffer not the rest,"
300,6,97,"By any way search’d out for ’scape, to come within the ports,"
300,6,98,"Lest, fled into their wives’ kind arms, they there be made the sports"
300,6,99,"Of the pursuing enemy. Exhort, and force your bands"
300,6,100,"To turn their faces; and, while we employ our ventur’d hands,"
300,6,101,"Though in a hard conditión, to make the other stay,"
300,6,102,"Hector, go thou to Ilion, and our queen - mother pray"
300,6,103,To take the richest robe she hath; the same that’s chiefly dear
300,6,104,"To her court fancy; with which gem, assembling more to her"
300,6,105,"Of Troy’s chief matrons, let all go, for fear of all our fates,"
300,6,106,"To Pallas’ temple, take the key, unlock the leavy gates,"
300,6,107,"Enter, and reach the highest tow’r, where her Palladium stands,"
300,6,108,"And on it put the precious veil with pure and rev’rend hands,"
300,6,109,"And vow to her, besides the gift, a sacrificing stroke"
300,6,110,"Of twelve fat heifers - of - a - year, that never felt the yoke,"
300,6,111,"(Most answ’ring to her maiden state) if she will pity us,"
300,6,112,"Our town, our wives, our youngest joys, and him, that plagues them"
300,6,113,"thus,"
300,6,114,"Take from the conflict, Diomed, that fury in a fight,"
300,6,115,"That true son of great Tydeús, that cunning lord of flight,"
300,6,116,Whom I esteem the strongest Greek; for we have never fled
300,6,117,"Achilles, that is prince of men, and whom a Goddess bred,"
300,6,118,"Like him; his fury flies so high, and all men’s wraths commands.”"
300,6,119,"Hector intends his brother’s will, but first through all his bands"
300,6,120,"He made quick way, encouraging; and all, to fear afraid,"
300,6,121,"All turn’d their heads, and made Greece turn. Slaughter stood still"
300,6,122,dismay’d
300,6,123,"On their parts, for they thought some God, fall’n from the vault of"
300,6,124,"stars,"
300,6,125,"Was rush’d into the Ilions’ aid, they made such dreadful wars."
300,6,126,"Thus Hector, toiling in the waves, and thrusting back the flood"
300,6,127,"Of his ebb’d forces, thus takes leave: “So, so, now runs your blood"
300,6,128,"In his right current; forwards now, Trojans, and far - call’d friends!"
300,6,129,"Awhile hold out, till, for success to this your brave amends,"
300,6,130,"I haste to Ilion, and procure our counsellors and wives"
300,6,131,"To pray, and offer hecatombs, for their states in our lives.”"
300,6,132,"Then fair - helm’d Hector turn’d to Troy, and, as he trode the field,"
300,6,133,"The black bull’s hide, that at his back he wore about his shield,"
300,6,134,"In the extreme circumference, was with his gait so rock’d,"
300,6,135,"That, being large, it both at once his neck and ankles knock’d."
300,6,136,"And now betwixt the hosts were met, Hippolochus’ brave son,"
300,6,137,"Glaucus, who in his very look hope of some wonder won,"
300,6,138,And little Tydeus’ mighty heir; who seeing such a man
300,6,139,"Offer the field, for usual blows, with wondrous words began:"
300,6,140,"“What art thou, strong’st of mortal men, that putt’st so far before,"
300,6,141,Whom these fights never show’d mine eyes? They have been evermore
300,6,142,"Sons of unhappy parents born, that came within the length"
300,6,143,"Of this Minerva - guided lance, and durst close with the strength"
300,6,144,"That she inspires in me. If heav’n be thy divine abode,"
300,6,145,"And thou a Deity thus inform’d, no more with any God"
300,6,146,Will I change lances. The strong son of Dryus did not live
300,6,147,"Long after such a conflict dar’d, who godlessly did drive"
300,6,148,"Nysæus’ nurses through the hill made sacred to his name,"
300,6,149,"And called Nysseius; with a goad he punch’d each furious dame,"
300,6,150,And made them ev’ry one cast down their green and leavy spears.
300,6,151,"This th’ homicide Lycurgus did; and those ungodly fears,"
300,6,152,"He put the froes in, seiz’d their God. Ev’n Bacchus he did drive"
300,6,153,"From his Nysseius; who was fain, with huge exclaims, to dive"
300,6,154,Into the ocean. Thetis there in her bright bosom took
300,6,155,"The flying Deity; who so fear’d Lycurgus’ threats, he shook."
300,6,156,"For which the freely - living Gods so highly were incens’d,"
300,6,157,"That Saturn’s great Son strook him blind, and with his life dispens’d"
300,6,158,"But small time after; all because th’ Immortals lov’d him not,"
300,6,159,Nor lov’d him since he striv’d with them; and his end hath begot
300,6,160,"Fear in my pow’rs to fight with heav’n. But, if the fruits of earth"
300,6,161,"Nourish thy body, and thy life be of our human birth,"
300,6,162,"Come near, that thou mayst soon arrive on that life - bounding shore,"
300,6,163,"To which I see thee hoise such sail.” “Why dost thou so explore,”"
300,6,164,"Said Glaucus, “of what race I am, when like the race of leaves"
300,6,165,"The race of man is, that deserves no question; nor receives"
300,6,166,My being any other breath? The wind in autumn strows
300,6,167,The earth with old leaves then the spring the woods with new endows;
300,6,168,"And so death scatters men on earth, so life puts out again"
300,6,169,"Man’s leavy issue. But my race, if, like the course of men,"
300,6,170,"Thou seek’st in more particular terms, ’tis this, to many known:"
300,6,171,"In midst of Argos, nurse of horse, there stands a walléd town,"
300,6,172,"Ephyré, where the mansion - house of Sisyphus did stand,"
300,6,173,"Of Sisyphus - Æölides, most wise of all the land."
300,6,174,"Glaucus was son to him, and he begat Bellerophon,"
300,6,175,"Whose body heav’n indu’d with strength, and put a beauty on,"
300,6,176,"Exceeding lovely. Prætis yet his cause of love did hate,"
300,6,177,And banish’d him the town; he might; he rul’d the Argive state.
300,6,178,"The virtue of the one Jove plac’d beneath the other’s pow’r,"
300,6,179,"His exile grew, since he denied to be the paramour"
300,6,180,"Of fair Anteia, Prætus’ wife, who felt a raging fire"
300,6,181,"Of secret love to him; but he, whom wisdom did inspire"
300,6,182,"As well as prudence, (one of them advising him to shun"
300,6,183,"The danger of a princess’ love, the other not to run"
300,6,184,"Within the danger of the Gods, the act being simply ill,)"
300,6,185,"Still entertaining thoughts divine, subdu’d the earthly still."
300,6,186,"She, rul’d by neither of his wits, preferr’d her lust to both,"
300,6,187,"And, false to Prætus, would seem true, with this abhorr’d untroth:"
300,6,188,"‘Prætus, or die thyself,’ said she, ‘or let Bellerophon die."
300,6,189,"He urg’d dishonour to thy bed; which since I did deny,"
300,6,190,"He thought his violence should grant, and sought thy shame by force.’"
300,6,191,"The king, incens’d with her report, resolv’d upon her course,"
300,6,192,"But doubted how it should be run; he shunn’d his death direct,"
300,6,193,(Holding a way so near not safe) and plotted the effect
300,6,194,"By sending him with letters seal’d (that, open’d, touch his life)[2]"
300,6,195,"To Rhëuns king of Lycia, and father to his wife."
300,6,196,"He went; and happily he went, the Gods walk’d all his way;"
300,6,197,"And being arriv’d in Lycia, where Xanthus doth display"
300,6,198,"The silver ensigns of his waves, the king of that broad land"
300,6,199,Receiv’d him with a wondrous free and honourable hand.
300,6,200,"Nine days he feasted him, and kill’d an ox in ev’ry day,"
300,6,201,"In thankful sacrifice to heav’n, for his fair guest; whose stay,"
300,6,202,"With rosy fingers, brought the world, the tenth well - welcom’d morn,"
300,6,203,"And then the king did move to see, the letters he had borne"
300,6,204,"From his lov’d son - in - law; which seen, he wrought thus their contents:"
300,6,205,"Chimæra, the invincible, he sent him to convince,"
300,6,206,"Sprung from no man, but mere divine; a lion’s shape before,"
300,6,207,"Behind a dragon’s, in the midst a goat’s shagg’d form, she bore,"
300,6,208,And flames of deadly fervency flew from her breath and eyes;
300,6,209,Yet her he slew; his confidence in sacred prodigies
300,6,210,Render’d him victor. Then he gave his second conquest way
300,6,211,"Against the famous Solymi, when (he himself would say,"
300,6,212,Reporting it) he enter’d on a passing vig’rous fight.
300,6,213,"His third huge labour he approv’d against a woman’s spite,"
300,6,214,That fill’d a field of Amazons; he overcame them all.
300,6,215,"Then set they on him sly Deceit, when Force had such a fall;"
300,6,216,"An ambush of the strongest men, that spacious Lycia bred,"
300,6,217,"Was lodg’d for him; whom he lodg’d sure, they never rais’d a head."
300,6,218,"His deeds thus showing him deriv’d from some celestial race,"
300,6,219,"The king detain’d, and made amends, with doing him the grace"
300,6,220,"Of his fair daughter’s princely gift; and with her, for a dow’r,"
300,6,221,"Gave half his kingdom; and to this, the Lycians on did pour"
300,6,222,"More than was giv’n to any king; a goodly planted field,"
300,6,223,"In some parts thick of groves and woods, the rest rich crops did yield,"
300,6,224,This field the Lycians futurely (of future wand’rings there
300,6,225,"And other errors of their prince, in the unhappy rear"
300,6,226,"Of his sad life) the Errant call’d, The princess brought him forth"
300,6,227,"Three children (whose ends griev’d him more, the more they were of"
300,6,228,worth)
300,6,229,"Isander; and Hippolochus; and fair Laodomy,"
300,6,230,"With whom, ev’n Jupiter himself left heav’n itself, to lie,"
300,6,231,"And had by her the man at arms, Sarpedon, call’d divine,"
300,6,232,"The Gods then left him, lest a man should in their glories shine,"
300,6,233,"And set against him; for his son, Isandrus, in a strife"
300,6,234,"Against the valiant Solymi, Mars reft of light and life;"
300,6,235,"Laodamïa, being envied of all the Goddesses,"
300,6,236,"The golden - bridle - handling Queen, the maiden Patroness,"
300,6,237,Slew with an arrow; and for this he wander’d evermore
300,6,238,"Alone through his Aleian field, and fed upon the core"
300,6,239,"Of his sad bosom, flying all the loth’d consórts of men."
300,6,240,"Yet had he one surviv’d to him, of those three childeren,"
300,6,241,"Hippolochus, the root of me; who sent me here with charge"
300,6,242,"That I should always bear me well, and my deserts enlarge"
300,6,243,"Beyond the vulgar, lest I sham’d my race, that far excell’d"
300,6,244,"All that Ephyra’s famous tow’rs, or ample Lycia, held."
300,6,245,"This is my stock, and this am I.” This cheer’d Tydides’ heart,"
300,6,246,"Who pitch’d his spear down, lean’d, and talk’d in this affectionate"
300,6,247,part:
300,6,248,"“Certés, in thy great ancestor, and in mine own, thou art"
300,6,249,"A guest of mine, right ancient. King Oeneus twenty days"
300,6,250,"Detain’d, with feasts, Bellerophon, whom all the world did praise."
300,6,251,"Betwixt whom mutual gifts were giv’n, My grandsire gave to thine"
300,6,252,"A girdle of Phœnician work, impurpl’d wondrous fine,"
300,6,253,"Thine gave a two - neck’d jug of gold, which, though I use not here,"
300,6,254,"Yet still it is my gem at home. But, if our fathers were"
300,6,255,"Familiar, or each other knew, I know not, since my sire"
300,6,256,"Left me a child, at siege of Thebes, where he left his life’s fire."
300,6,257,"But let us prove our grandsires’ sons, and be each other’s guests."
300,6,258,"To Lycia when I come, do thou receive thy friend with feasts;"
300,6,259,"Peloponnesus, with the like, shall thy wish’d presence greet."
300,6,260,"Mean space, shun we each other here, though in the press we meet."
300,6,261,"There are enow of Troy beside, and men enow renown’d,"
300,6,262,"To right my pow’rs, whomever heav’n shall let my lance confound,"
300,6,263,"So are there of the Greeks for thee; kill who thou canst. And now,"
300,6,264,"For sign of amity ’twixt us, and that all these may know"
300,6,265,"We glory in th’ hospitious rites our grandsires did commend,"
300,6,266,"Change we our arms before them all.” From horse then both descend,"
300,6,267,"Join hands, give faith, and take; and then did Jupiter elate[3]"
300,6,268,"The mind of Glaucus, who, to show his rev’rence to the state"
300,6,269,"Of virtue in his grandsire’s heart, and gratulate beside"
300,6,270,"The offer of so great a friend, exchang’d in that good pride,"
300,6,271,"Curets of gold for those of brass, that did on Diomed shine,"
300,6,272,"One of a hundred oxen’s price, the other but of nine."
300,6,273,"By this, had Hector reach’d the ports of Scæa, and the tow’rs."
300,6,274,"About him flock’d the wives of Troy, the children, paramours,"
300,6,275,"Inquiring how their husbands did, their fathers, brothers, loves."
300,6,276,"He stood not then to answer them, but said: “It now behoves"
300,6,277,"Ye should all go t’ implore the aid of heav’n, in a distress"
300,6,278,"Of great effect, and imminent.” Then hasted he access"
300,6,279,"To Priam’s goodly builded court, which round about was run"
300,6,280,"With walking porches, galleries, to keep off rain and sun."
300,6,281,"Within, of one side, on a rew, of sundry - colour’d stones,"
300,6,282,"Fifty fair lodgings were built out, for Priam’s fifty sons,"
300,6,283,"And for as fair sort of their wives; and, in the opposite view,"
300,6,284,"Twelve lodgings of like stone, like height, were likewise built arew,"
300,6,285,"Where, with their fair and virtuous wives, twelve princes, sons in law"
300,6,286,"To honourable Priam, lay. And here met Hecuba,"
300,6,287,"The loving mother, her great son; and with her needs must be"
300,6,288,"The fairest of her female race, the bright Laodice."
300,6,289,"The queen gript hard her Hector’s hand, and said: “O worthiest son,"
300,6,290,Why leav’st thou field? Is’t not because the curséd nation
300,6,291,Afflict our countrymen and friends? They are their moans that move
300,6,292,"Thy mind to come and lift thy hands, in his high tow’r, to Jove."
300,6,293,"But stay a little, that myself may fetch our sweetest wine"
300,6,294,"To offer first to Jupiter, then that these joints of thine"
300,6,295,"May be refresh’d; for, woe is me, how thou art toil’d and spent!"
300,6,296,"Thou for our city’s gen’ral state, thou for our friends far sent,"
300,6,297,"Must now the press of fight endure; now solitude, to call"
300,6,298,Upon the name of Jupiter; thou only for us all.
300,6,299,But wine will something comfort thee; for to a man dismay’d
300,6,300,"With careful spirits, or too much with labour overlaid,"
300,6,301,"Wine brings much rescue, strength’ning much the body and the mind.”"
300,6,302,The great helm - mover thus receiv’d the auth’ress of his kind:
300,6,303,"“My royal mother, bring no wine; lest rather it impair"
300,6,304,"Than help my strength, and make my mind forgetful of th’ affair"
300,6,305,Committed to it; and (to pour it out in sacrifice)
300,6,306,I fear with unwash’d hands to serve the pure - liv’d Deities.
300,6,307,"Nor is it lawful, thus imbru’d with blood and dust, to prove"
300,6,308,"The will of heav’n, or offer vows to cloud - compelling Jove."
300,6,309,"I only come to use your pains (assembling other dames,"
300,6,310,"Matrons, and women honour’d most, with high and virtuous names)"
300,6,311,"With wine and odours, and a robe most ample, most of price,"
300,6,312,"And which is dearest in your love, to offer sacrifice"
300,6,313,In Pallas’ temple; and to put the precious robe ye bear.
300,6,314,"On her Palladium; vowing all, twelve oxen - of - a - year,"
300,6,315,"Whose necks were never wrung with yoke, shall pay her grace their"
300,6,316,"lives,"
300,6,317,"If she will pity our sieg’d town; pity ourselves, our wives;"
300,6,318,"Pity our children; and remove, from sacred Ilion,"
300,6,319,"The dreadful soldier Diomed. And, when yourselves are gone"
300,6,320,"About this work, myself will go, to call into the field,"
300,6,321,"If he will hear me, Helen’s love; whom would the earth would yield)"
300,6,322,"And headlong take into her gulf, even quick before mine eyes;"
300,6,323,"For then my heart, I hope, would cast her load of miseries,"
300,6,324,"Borne for the plague he hath been born, and bred to the deface,"
300,6,325,"By great Olympius, of Troy, our sire, and all our race.”"
300,6,326,"This said, grave Hecuba went home, and sent her maids about,"
300,6,327,"To bid the matrons. She herself descended, and search’d out,"
300,6,328,"Within a place that breath’d perfumes, the richest robe she had;"
300,6,329,"Which lay with many rich ones more, most curiously made"
300,6,330,"By women of Sidonia; which Paris brought from thence,"
300,6,331,"Sailing the broad sea, when he made that voyage of offence,"
300,6,332,"In which he brought home Helena. That robe, transferr’d so far,"
300,6,333,(That was the undermost) she took; it glittered like a star;
300,6,334,"And with it went she to the fane, with many ladies more;"
300,6,335,Amongst whom fair - cheek’d Theano unlock’d the folded door;
300,6,336,"Chaste Theano, Antenor’s wife, and of Cissëus’ race,"
300,6,337,"Sister to Hecuba, both born to that great king of Thrace."
300,6,338,Her th’ Ilions made Minerva’s priest; and her they follow’d all
300,6,339,"Up to the temple’s highest tow’r, where on their knees they fall,"
300,6,340,"Lift up their hands, and fill the fane with ladies’ piteous cries."
300,6,341,"Then lovely Theano took the veil, and with it she implies"
300,6,342,"The great Palladium, praying thus: “Goddess of most renown"
300,6,343,"In all the heav’n of Goddesses, great Guardian of our town,"
300,6,344,"Rev’rend Minerva, break the lance of Diomed, cease his grace,"
300,6,345,"Give him to fall in shameful flight, headlong, and on his face,"
300,6,346,"Before our ports of Ilion, that instantly we may,"
300,6,347,"Twelve unyok’d oxen - of - a - year, in this thy temple slay,"
300,6,348,"To thy sole honour; take their bloods, and banish our offence;"
300,6,349,"Accept Troy’s zeal, her wives, and save her infants’ innocence.”"
300,6,350,"She pray’d, but Pallas would not grant. Mean space was Hector come"
300,6,351,"Where Alexander’s lodgings were, that many a goodly room"
300,6,352,"Had built in them by architects, of Troy’s most curious sort,"
300,6,353,"And were no lodgings, but a house; nor no house, but a court;"
300,6,354,"Or had all these contain’d in them; and all within a tow’r,"
300,6,355,Next Hector’s lodgings and the king’s. The lov’d of heav’n’s chief
300,6,356,"Pow’r,"
300,6,357,"Hector, here enter’d. In his hand a goodly lance he bore,"
300,6,358,"Ten cubits long; the brazen head went shining ill before,"
300,6,359,Help’d with a burnish’d ring of gold. He found his brother then
300,6,360,"Amongst the women, yet prepar’d to go amongst the men,"
300,6,361,"For in their chamber he was set, trimming his arms, his shield,"
300,6,362,"His curets, and was trying how his crookéd bow would yield"
300,6,363,"To his straight arms. Amongst her maids was set the Argive Queen,"
300,6,364,Commanding them in choicest works. When Hector’s eye had seen
300,6,365,"His brother thus accompanied, and that he could not bear"
300,6,366,"The very touching of his arms but where the women were,"
300,6,367,"And when the time so needed men, right cunningly he chid."
300,6,368,"That he might do it bitterly, his cowardice he hid,"
300,6,369,"That simply made him so retir’d, beneath an anger, feign’d"
300,6,370,"In him by Hector, for the hate the citizens sustain’d"
300,6,371,"Against him, for the foil he took in their cause; and again,"
300,6,372,For all their gen’ral foils in his. So Hector seems to plain
300,6,373,"Of his wrath to them, for their hate, and not his cowardice;[4]"
300,6,374,"As that were it that shelter’d him in his effeminacies,"
300,6,375,"And kept him, in that dang’rous time, from their fit aid in fight;"
300,6,376,For which he chid thus: “Wretched man! So timeless is thy spite
300,6,377,"That ’tis not honest; and their hate is just, ’gainst which it bends."
300,6,378,War burns about the town for thee; for thee our slaughter’d friends
300,6,379,"Besiege Troy with their carcasses, on whose heaps our high walls"
300,6,380,Are overlook’d by enemies; the sad sounds of their falls
300,6,381,"Without, are echo’d with the cries of wives and babes within;"
300,6,382,And all for thee; and yet for them thy honour cannot win
300,6,383,"Head of thine anger. Thou shouldst need no spirit to stir up thine,"
300,6,384,"But thine should set the rest on fire, and with a rage divine"
300,6,385,"Chastise impartially the best, that impiously forbears."
300,6,386,"Come forth, lest thy fair tow’rs and Troy be burn’d about thine ears.”"
300,6,387,"Paris acknowledg’d, as before, all just that Hector spake,"
300,6,388,"Allowing justice, though it were for his injustice’ sake;"
300,6,389,"And where his brother put a wrath upon him by his art,"
300,6,390,"He takes it, for his honour’s sake, as sprung out of his heart,"
300,6,391,And rather would have anger seem his fault than cowardice;
300,6,392,"And thus he answer’d: “Since, with right, you join’d check with advice,"
300,6,393,"And I hear you, give equal ear: It is not any spleen"
300,6,394,"Against the town, as you conceive, that makes me so unseen,"
300,6,395,"But sorrow for it; which to ease, and by discourse digest"
300,6,396,"Within myself, I live so close; and yet, since men might wrest"
300,6,397,"My sad retreat, like you, my wife with her advice inclin’d"
300,6,398,"This my addression to the field; which was mine own free mind,"
300,6,399,"As well as th’ instance of her words; for though the foil were mine,"
300,6,400,Conquest brings forth her wreaths by turns. Stay then this haste of
300,6,401,thine
300,6,402,"But till I arm, and I am made a cónsort for thee straight; —"
300,6,403,"Or go, I’ll overtake thy haste.” Helen stood at receipt,"
300,6,404,"And took up all great Hector’s pow’rs, t’ attend her heavy words,"
300,6,405,By which had Paris no reply. This vent her grief affords:
300,6,406,"“Brother (if I may call you so, that had been better born"
300,6,407,"A dog, than such a horrid dame, as all men curse and scorn,"
300,6,408,"A mischief - maker, a man - plague) O would to God, the day,"
300,6,409,"That first gave light to me, had been a whirlwind in my way,"
300,6,410,"And borne me to some desert hill, or hid me in the rage"
300,6,411,"Of earth’s most far - resounding seas, ere I should thus engage"
300,6,412,The dear lives of so many friends! Yet since the Gods have been
300,6,413,"Helpless foreseers of my plagues, they might have likewise seen"
300,6,414,"That he they put in yoke with me, to bear out their award,"
300,6,415,"Had been a man of much more spirit, and, or had noblier dar’d"
300,6,416,"To shield mine honour with this deed, or with his mind had known"
300,6,417,"Much better the upbraids of men, that so he might have shown"
300,6,418,(More like a man) some sense of grief for both my shame and his.
300,6,419,"But he is senseless, nor conceives what any manhood is,"
300,6,420,"Nor now, nor ever after will; and therefore hangs, I fear,"
300,6,421,"A plague above him. But come near, good brother; rest you here,"
300,6,422,"Who, of the world of men, stands charg’d with most unrest for me,"
300,6,423,(Vile wretch) and for my lover’s wrong; on whom a destiny
300,6,424,"So bitter is impos’d by Jove, that all succeeding times"
300,6,425,"Will put, to our unended shames, in all men’s mouths our crimes.”"
300,6,426,"He answer’d: “Helen, do not seek to make me sit with thee;"
300,6,427,"I must not stay, though well I know thy honour’d love of me."
300,6,428,"My mind calls forth to aid our friends, in whom my absence breeds"
300,6,429,"Longings to see me; for whose sakes, importune thou to deeds"
300,6,430,"This man by all means, that your care may make his own make hast,"
300,6,431,"And meet me in the open town, that all may see at last"
300,6,432,"He minds his lover. I myself will now go home, and see"
300,6,433,"My household, my dear wife, and son, that little hope of me;"
300,6,434,"For, sister, ’tis without my skill, if I shall evermore"
300,6,435,"Return, and see them, or to earth, her right in me, restore."
300,6,436,"The Gods may stoop me by the Greeks.” This said, he went to see"
300,6,437,"The virtuous princess, his true wife, white - arm’d Andromache."
300,6,438,"She, with her infant son and maid, was climb’d the tow’r about"
300,6,439,"The sight of him that sought for her, weeping and crying out."
300,6,440,"Hector, not finding her at home, was going forth; retir’d;"
300,6,441,"Stood in the gate; her woman call’d, and curiously inquir’d"
300,6,442,"Where she was gone; bad tell him true, if she were gone to see"
300,6,443,"His sisters, or his brothers’ wives; or whether she should be"
300,6,444,"At temple with the other dames, t’ implore Minerva’s ruth."
300,6,445,"Her woman answer’d: Since he ask’d, and urg’d so much the truth,"
300,6,446,"The truth was she was neither gone, to see his brothers’ wives,"
300,6,447,"His sisters, nor t’ implore the ruth of Pallas on their lives;"
300,6,448,"But she (advertis’d of the bane Troy suffer’d, and how vast"
300,6,449,"Conquest had made herself for Greece) like one distraught, made hast"
300,6,450,"To ample Ilion with her son, and nurse, and all the way"
300,6,451,"Mourn’d, and dissolv’d in tears for him. Then Hector made no stay,"
300,6,452,"But trod her path, and through the streets, magnificently built,"
300,6,453,"All the great city pass’d, and came where, seeing how blood was spilt,"
300,6,454,Andromache might see him come: who made as he would pass
300,6,455,"The ports without saluting her, not knowing where she was."
300,6,456,"She, with his sight, made breathless haste, to meet him; she, whose"
300,6,457,grace
300,6,458,Brought him withal so great a dow’r; she that of all the race
300,6,459,"Of king Aëtion only liv’d; Aëtion, whose house stood"
300,6,460,"Beneath the mountain Placius, environ’d with the wood"
300,6,461,"Of Theban Hypoplace, being court to the Cilician land."
300,6,462,"She ran to Hector, and with her, tender of heart and hand,"
300,6,463,"Her son, borne in his nurse’s arms; when, like a heav’nly sign,"
300,6,464,"Compact of many golden stars, the princely child did shine,"
300,6,465,"Whom Hector call’d Scamandrius, but whom the town did name"
300,6,466,"Astyanax, because his sire did only prop the same."
300,6,467,"Hector, though grief bereft his speech, yet smil’d upon his joy."
300,6,468,"Andromache cried out, mix’d hands, and to the strength of Troy"
300,6,469,Thus wept forth her affectión: “O noblest in desire!
300,6,470,"Thy mind, inflam’d with others’ good, will set thyself on fire."
300,6,471,"Nor pitiest thou thy son, nor wife, who must thy widow be,"
300,6,472,If now thou issue; all the field will only run on thee.
300,6,473,"Better my shoulders underwent the earth, than thy decease;"
300,6,474,For then would earth bear joys no more; then comes the black increase
300,6,475,Of griefs (like Greeks on Ilion). Alas! What one survives
300,6,476,"To be my refuge? One black day bereft sev’n brothers’ lives,"
300,6,477,"By stern Achilles; by his hand my father breath’d his last,"
300,6,478,"His high - wall’d rich Cilician Thebes[5] sack’d by him, and laid wast;"
300,6,479,The royal body yet he left unspoil’d; religion charm’d
300,6,480,That act of spoil; and all in fire he burn’d him cómplete arm’d;
300,6,481,Built over him a royal tomb; and to the monument
300,6,482,"He left of him, th’ Oreades (that are the high descent"
300,6,483,Of Ægis - bearing Jupiter) another of their own
300,6,484,"Did add to it, and set it round with elms; by which is shown,"
300,6,485,"In theirs, the barrenness of death; yet might it serve beside"
300,6,486,To shelter the sad monument from all the ruffinous pride
300,6,487,"Of storms and tempests, us’d to hurt things or that noble kind,"
300,6,488,"The short life yet my mother liv’d he sav’d, and serv’d his mind"
300,6,489,With all the riches of the realm; which not enough esteem’d
300,6,490,"He kept her pris’ner; whom small time, but much more wealth, redeem’d,"
300,6,491,"And she, in sylvan Hypoplace, Cilicia rul’d again,"
300,6,492,But soon was over - rul’d by death; Diana’s chaste disdain
300,6,493,"Gave her a lance, and took her life. Yet, all these gone from me,"
300,6,494,"Thou amply render’st all; thy life makes still my father be,"
300,6,495,"My mother, brothers; and besides thou art my husband too,"
300,6,496,"Most lov’d, most worthy. Pity them, dear love, and do not go,"
300,6,497,"For thou gone, all these go again; pity our common joy,"
300,6,498,"Lest, of a father’s patronage, the bulwark of all Troy,"
300,6,499,"Thou leav’st him a poor widow’s charge. Stay, stay then, in this tow’r,"
300,6,500,And call up to the wild fig - tree all thy retiréd pow’r;
300,6,501,"For there the wall is easiest scal’d, and fittest for surprise,"
300,6,502,"And there, th’ Ajaces, Idomen, th’ Atrides, Diomed, thrice"
300,6,503,Have both survey’d and made attempt; I know not if induc’d
300,6,504,"By some wise augury, or the fact was naturally infus’d"
300,6,505,"Into their wits, or courages.” To this, great Hector said:"
300,6,506,"“Be well assur’d, wife, all these things in my kind cares are weigh’d."
300,6,507,"But what a shame, and fear, it is to think how Troy would scorn"
300,6,508,"(Both in her husbands, and her wives, whom long - train’d gowns adorn)"
300,6,509,That I should cowardly fly off! The spirit I first did breath
300,6,510,"Did never teach me that; much less, since the contempt of death"
300,6,511,"Was settled in me, and my mind knew what a worthy was,"
300,6,512,"Whose office is to lead in fight, and give no danger pass"
300,6,513,Without improvement. In this fire must Hector’s trial shine;
300,6,514,"Here must his country, father, friends, be, in him, made divine."
300,6,515,And such a stormy day shall come (in mind and soul I know)
300,6,516,"When sacred Troy shall shed her tow’rs, for tears of overthrow;"
300,6,517,"When Priam, all his birth and pow’r, shall in those tears be drown’d."
300,6,518,"But neither Troy’s posterity so much my soul doth wound,"
300,6,519,"Priam, nor Hecuba herself, nor all my brothers’ woes,"
300,6,520,"(Who though so many, and so good, must all be food for foes)"
300,6,521,"As thy sad state; when some rude Greek shall lead thee weeping hence,"
300,6,522,"These free days clouded, and a night of captive violence"
300,6,523,"Loading thy temples, out of which thine eyes must never see,"
300,6,524,"But spin the Greek wives’ webs of task, and their fetch water be"
300,6,525,"To Argos, from Messeides, or clear Hyperia’s spring;[6]"
300,6,526,"Which howsoever thou abhorr’st, Fate’s such a shrewish thing"
300,6,527,"She will be mistress; whose curs’d hands, when they shall crush out"
300,6,528,cries
300,6,529,From thy oppressions (being beheld by other enemies)
300,6,530,"Thus they will nourish thy extremes: ‘This dame was Hector’s wife,"
300,6,531,"A man that, at the wars of Troy, did breathe the worthiest life"
300,6,532,"Of all their army.’ This again will rub thy fruitful wounds,"
300,6,533,To miss the man that to thy bands could give such narrow bounds.
300,6,534,But that day shall not wound mine eyes; the solid heap of night
300,6,535,"Shall interpose, and stop mine ears against thy plaints, and plight.”"
300,6,536,"This said, he reach’d to take his son; who, of his arms afraid,"
300,6,537,"And then the horse - hair plume, with which he was so overlaid,"
300,6,538,"Nodded so horribly, he cling’d back to his nurse, and cried."
300,6,539,"Laughter affected his great sire, who doff’d, and laid aside"
300,6,540,"His fearful helm, that on the earth cast round about it light;"
300,6,541,"Then took and kiss’d his loving son, and (balancing his weight"
300,6,542,In dancing him) these loving vows to living Jove he us’d
300,6,543,And all the other bench of Gods: “O you that have infus’d
300,6,544,"Soul to this infant, now set down this blessing on his star; —"
300,6,545,Let his renown be clear as mine; equal his strength in war;
300,6,546,"And make his reign so strong in Troy, that years to come may yield"
300,6,547,"His facts this fame, when, rich in spoils, he leaves the conquer’d"
300,6,548,field
300,6,549,Sown with his slaughters: ‘These high deeds exceed his father’s worth.’
300,6,550,And let this echo’d praise supply the comforts to come forth
300,6,551,"Of his kind mother with my life.” This said, th’ heroic sire"
300,6,552,Gave him his mother; whose fair eyes fresh streams of love’s salt fire
300,6,553,"Billow’d on her soft cheeks, to hear the last of Hector’s speech,"
300,6,554,In which his vows compris’d the sum of all he did beseech
300,6,555,In her wish’d comfort. So she took into her od’rous breast
300,6,556,"Her husband’s gift; who, mov’d to see her heart so much oppress’d,"
300,6,557,"He dried her tears, and thus desir’d: “Afflict me not, dear wife,"
300,6,558,"With these vain griefs. He doth not live, that can disjoin my life"
300,6,559,"And this firm bosom, but my fate; and fate, whose wings can fly?"
300,6,560,"Noble, ignoble, fate controls. Once born, the best must die,"
300,6,561,"Go home, and set thy housewif’ry on these extremes of thought;"
300,6,562,And drive war from them with thy maids; keep them from doing nought.
300,6,563,"These will be nothing; leave the cares of war to men, and me"
300,6,564,"In whom, of all the Ilion race, they take their high’st degree.”"
300,6,565,"On went his helm; his princess home, half cold with kindly fears;"
300,6,566,"When ev’ry fear turn’d back her looks, and ev’ry look shed tears."
300,6,567,"Foe - slaught’ring Hector’s house soon reach’d, her many women there"
300,6,568,Wept all to see her: in his life great Hector’s fun’rals were;
300,6,569,"Never look’d any eye of theirs to see their lord safe home,"
300,6,570,‘Scap’d from the gripes and pow’rs of Greece. And now was Paris come
300,6,571,"From his high tow’rs; who made no stay, when once he had put on"
300,6,572,"His richest armour, but flew forth; the flints he trod upon"
300,6,573,Sparkled with lustre of his arms; his long - ebb’d spirits now flow’d
300,6,574,"The higher for their lower ebb. And as a fair steed, proud[7]"
300,6,575,"With full - giv’n mangers, long tied up, and now, his head stall broke,"
300,6,576,"He breaks from stable, runs the field, and with an ample stroke"
300,6,577,"Measures the centre, neighs, and lifts aloft his wanton head,"
300,6,578,"About his shoulders shakes his crest, and where he hath been fed,"
300,6,579,"Or in some calm flood wash’d, or, stung with his high plight, he flies"
300,6,580,"Amongst his females, strength put forth, his beauty beautifies,"
300,6,581,"And, like life’s mirror, bears his gait; so Paris from the tow’r"
300,6,582,Of lofty Pergamus came forth; he show’d a sun - like pow’r
300,6,583,"In carriage of his goodly parts, address’d now to the strife;"
300,6,584,And found his noble brother near the place he left his wife.
300,6,585,"Him thus respected he salutes: “Right worthy, I have fear"
300,6,586,"That your so serious haste to field, my stay hath made forbear,"
300,6,587,"And that I come not as you wish.” He answer’d: “Honour’d man,"
300,6,588,"Be confident, for not myself, nor any others, can"
300,6,589,"Reprove in thee the work of fight, at least, not any such"
300,6,590,As is an equal judge of things; for thou hast strength as much
300,6,591,"As serves to execute a mind very important, but"
300,6,592,"Thy strength too readily flies off, enough will is not put"
300,6,593,"To thy ability. My heart is in my mind’s strife sad,"
300,6,594,"When Troy (out of her much distress, she and her friends have had"
300,6,595,By thy procurement) doth deprave thy noblesse in mine ears.
300,6,596,"But come, hereafter we shall calm these hard conceits of theirs,"
300,6,597,"When, from their ports the foe expuls’d, high Jove to them hath giv’n"
300,6,598,"Wish’d peace, and us free sacrifice to all the Powers of heav’n.”"

300,6,631,THE SEVENTH BOOK OF HOMER’S ILIADS[1]
300,6,632,THE ARGUMENT
300,6,633,"Hector, by Helenus’ advice, doth seek"
300,6,634,"Advent’rous combat on the boldest Greek,"
300,6,635,"Nine Greeks stand up, acceptants ev’ry one,"
300,6,636,But lot selects strong Ajax Telamon.
300,6,637,"Both, with high honour, stand th’ important fight,"
300,6,638,Till heralds part them by approached night.
300,6,639,"Lastly, they grave the dead. The Greeks erect"
300,6,640,"A mighty wall, their navy to protect;"
300,6,641,"Which angers Neptune. Jove, by hapless signs,"
300,6,642,"In depth of night, succeeding woes divines."
300,6,643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,6,644,"In Eta, Priam’s strongest son"
300,6,645,Combats with Ajax Telamon.
300,6,646,"This said, brave Hector through the ports, with Troy’s bane - bringing knight,"
300,6,647,"Made issue to th’ insatiate field, resolv’d to fervent fight."
300,6,648,"And as the Weather - wielder sends to seamen prosp’rous gales,"
300,6,649,"When with their sallow polish’d oars, long lifted from their falls,"
300,6,650,"Their wearied arms, dissolv’d with toil, can scarce strike one stroke more;"
300,6,651,"Like those sweet winds appear’d these lords, to Trojans tir’d before."
300,6,652,Then fell they to the works of death. By Paris’ valour fell
300,6,653,"King Arëithous’ hapless son, that did in Arna dwell,"
300,6,654,"Menesthius, whose renownéd sire a club did ever bear,"
300,6,655,"And of Phylomedusa gat, that had her eyes so clear,"
300,6,656,This slaughter’d issue. Hector’s dart strook Eionëus dead;
300,6,657,"Beneath his good steel casque it pierc’d, above his gorget - stead."
300,6,658,"Glaucus, Hippolochus’s son, that led the Lycian crew,"
300,6,659,"Iphinous - Dexiades with sudden jav’lin slew,"
300,6,660,"As he was mounting to his horse; his shoulders took the spear,"
300,6,661,"And ere he sate, in tumbling, down, his powers dissolvéd were."
300,6,662,"When gray - ey’d Pallas had perceiv’d the Greeks so fall in fight,"
300,6,663,"From high Olympus’ top she stoop’d, and did on Ilion light."
300,6,664,"Apollo, to encounter her, to Pergamus did fly,"
300,6,665,"From whence he, looking to the field, wish’d Trojans’ victory."
300,6,666,At Jove’s broad beech these Godheads met; and first Jove’s son objects;
300,6,667,"“Why, burning in contention thus, do thy extreme affects"
300,6,668,Conduct thee from our peaceful hill? Is it to oversway
300,6,669,"The doubtful victory of fight, and give the Greeks the day?"
300,6,670,"Thou never pitiest perishing Troy. Yet now let me persuade,"
300,6,671,That this day no more mortal wounds may either side invade.
300,6,672,"Hereafter, till the end of Troy, they shall apply the fight,"
300,6,673,Since your immortal wills resolve to overturn it quite.”
300,6,674,Pallas replied: “It likes me well; for this came I from heav’n;
300,6,675,"But to make either armies cease, what order shall be giv’n?”"
300,6,676,"He said: “We will direct the spirit, that burns in Hector’s breast,"
300,6,677,"To challenge any Greek to wounds, with single pow’rs impress’d;"
300,6,678,"Which Greeks, admiring, will accept, and make some one stand out"
300,6,679,"So stout a challenge to receive, with a defence as stout.”"
300,6,680,It is confirm’d; and Helenus (king Priam’s lovéd seed)
300,6,681,"By augury discern’d th’ event that these two pow’rs decreed,"
300,6,682,And greeting Hector ask’d him this: “Wilt thou be once advis’d?
300,6,683,"I am thy brother, and thy life with mine is ev’nly prized."
300,6,684,"Command the rest of Troy and Greece; to cease this public fight,"
300,6,685,"And, what Greek bears the greatest mind, to single strokes excite."
300,6,686,I promise thee that yet thy soul shall not descend to fates;
300,6,687,"So heard I thy survival cast, by the celestial States.”"
300,6,688,"Hector with glad allowance gave his brother’s counsel ear,"
300,6,689,"And, fronting both the hosts, advanc’d just in the midst his spear."
300,6,690,The Trojans instantly surcease; the Greeks Atrides stay’d.
300,6,691,"The God that bears the silver bow, and war’s triumphant Maid,"
300,6,692,"On Jove’s beech like two vultures sat, pleas’d to behold both parts"
300,6,693,"Flow in to hear, so sternly arm’d with huge shields, helms, and darts."
300,6,694,"And such fresh horror as you see, driv’n through the wrinkled waves"
300,6,695,"By rising Zephyr, under whom the sea grows black, and raves;"
300,6,696,Such did the hasty gath’ring troops’ of both hosts make to hear;
300,6,697,"Whose tumult settled, ’twixt them both, thus spake the challenger:"
300,6,698,"“Hear, Trojans, and ye well - arm’d Greeks, what my strong mind, diffus’d"
300,6,699,"Through all my spirits, commands me speak: Saturnius hath not us’d"
300,6,700,"His promis’d favour for our truce, but, studying both our ills,"
300,6,701,"Will never cease, till Mars, by you, his rav’nous stomach fills"
300,6,702,"With ruin’d Troy, or we consume your mighty sea - borne fleet."
300,6,703,"Since then the gen’ral peers of Greece in reach of one voice meet,"
300,6,704,"Amongst you all, whose breast includes the most impulsive mind,"
300,6,705,"Let him stand forth as combatant, by all the rest design’d."
300,6,706,"Before whom thus I call high Jove, to witness of our strife: —"
300,6,707,"If he with home - thrust iron can reach th’ exposure of my life,"
300,6,708,"Spoiling my arms, let him at will convey them to his tent,"
300,6,709,"But let my body be return’d, that Troy’s two - sex’d descent"
300,6,710,"May waste it in the fun’ral pile. If I can slaughter him,"
300,6,711,"Apollo honouring me so much, I’ll spoil his conquer’d limb,"
300,6,712,"And bear his arms to Ilion, where in Apollo’s shrine"
300,6,713,"I’ll hang them, as my trophies due; his body I’ll resign"
300,6,714,"To be disposed by his friends in flamy funerals,"
300,6,715,"And honour’d with erected tomb, where Hellespontus falls"
300,6,716,"Into Ægæum, and doth reach ev’n to your naval road,"
300,6,717,"That, when our beings in the earth shall hide their period,"
300,6,718,"Survivors, sailing the black sea, may thus his name renew:"
300,6,719,"‘This is his monument whose blood long since did fates imbrue,"
300,6,720,"Whom, passing far in fortitude illustrate Hector slew.’"
300,6,721,"This shall posterity report, and my fame never die.”"
300,6,722,"This said, dumb silence seiz’d them all; they shaméd to deny,"
300,6,723,"And fear’d to undertake. At last did Menelaus speak,"
300,6,724,"Check’d their remissness, and so sigh’d, as if his heart would break:"
300,6,725,"“Ah me! But only threat’ning Greeks, not worthy Grecian names![2]"
300,6,726,"This more and more, not to be borne, makes grow our huge defames,"
300,6,727,If Hector’s honourable proof be entertain’d by none.
300,6,728,"But you are earth and water all, which, symboliz’d in one,"
300,6,729,"Have fram’d your faint unfi’ry spirits; ye sit without your hearts,"
300,6,730,"Grossly inglorious; but myself will use acceptive darts,"
300,6,731,"And arm against him, though you think I arm ’gainst too much odds;"
300,6,732,"But conquest’s garlands hang aloft, amongst th’ Immortal Gods.”"
300,6,733,"He arm’d, and gladly would have fought; but Menelaus, then,"
300,6,734,"By Hector’s far more strength, thy soul had fled th’ abodes of men,"
300,6,735,"Had not the kings of Greece stood up, and thy attempt restrain’d;"
300,6,736,"And ev’n the king of men himself, that in such compass reign’d,"
300,6,737,"Who took him by the bold right hand, and sternly pluck’d him back:"
300,6,738,"“Mad brother, ’tis no work for thee, thou seek’st thy wilful wrack!"
300,6,739,"Contain, though it despite thee much, nor for this strife engage"
300,6,740,"Thy person with a man more strong, and whom all fear t’ enrage;"
300,6,741,"Yea whom Æacides himself, in men - renowning war,"
300,6,742,"Makes doubt t’ encounter, whose huge strength surpasseth thine by far."
300,6,743,Sit thou then by thy regiment; some other Greek will rise
300,6,744,"(Though he be dreadless, and no war will his desires suffice,"
300,6,745,That makes this challenge to our strength) our valours to avow;
300,6,746,"To whom, if he can ’scape with life, he will be glad to bow.”"
300,6,747,"This drew his brother from his will, who yielded, knowing it true,"
300,6,748,And his glad soldiers took his arms; when Nestor did pursue
300,6,749,"The same reproof he set on foot, and thus supplied his turn:"
300,6,750,“What huge indignity is this! How will our country mourn!
300,6,751,"Old Peleus that good king will weep, that worthy counsellor,"
300,6,752,"That trumpet of the Myrmidons, who much did ask me for"
300,6,753,All men of name that went to Troy; with joy he did inquire
300,6,754,"Their valour and their towardness, and I made him admire;"
300,6,755,"But, that ye all fear Hector now, if his grave ears shall hear,"
300,6,756,"How will he lift his hands to heav’n, and pray that death may bear"
300,6,757,"His grieved soul into the deep! O would to heav’n’s great King,[3]"
300,6,758,"Minerva, and the God of light, that now my youthful spring"
300,6,759,"Did flourish in my willing veins, as when at Phæa’s tow’rs"
300,6,760,"About the streams of Jardanus, my gather’d Pylean pow’rs,"
300,6,761,"And dart - employ’d Arcadians, fought, near raging Celadon!"
300,6,762,"Amongst whom, first of all, stood forth great Ereuthalion,"
300,6,763,"Who th’ arms of Arëithoús wore, brave Arëithoús,"
300,6,764,"And, since he still fought with a club, surnam’d Clavigerus,"
300,6,765,"All men, and fair - girt ladies both, for honour call’d him so."
300,6,766,"He fought not with a keep - off spear, or with a far - shot bow,"
300,6,767,"But, with a massy club of iron, he broke through arméd bands."
300,6,768,"And yet Lycurgus was his death, but not with force of hands;"
300,6,769,"With sleight (encount’ring in a lane, where his club wanted sway)"
300,6,770,"He thrust him through his spacious waist; who fell, and upwards lay,"
300,6,771,"In death not bowing his face to earth; his arms he did despoil,"
300,6,772,"Which iron Mars bestow’d on him; and those, in Mars’s toil,"
300,6,773,"Lycurgus ever after wore; but when he agéd grew,"
300,6,774,"Enforc’d to keep his peaceful house, their use he did renew"
300,6,775,"On mighty Ereuthalion’s limbs, his soldier, lovéd well;"
300,6,776,"And, with these arms he challeng’d all, that did in arms excel;"
300,6,777,"All shook, and stood dismay’d, none durst his adverse champion make."
300,6,778,"Yet this same forward mind of mine, of choice, would undertake"
300,6,779,To fight with all his confidence; though youngest enemy
300,6,780,"Of all the army we conduct, yet I fought with him, I,"
300,6,781,"Minerva made me so renown’d, and that most tall strong peer"
300,6,782,"I slew; his big bulk lay on earth, extended here and there,"
300,6,783,As it were covetous to spread the centre ev’rywhere.
300,6,784,"O that my youth were now as fresh, and all my pow’rs as sound,"
300,6,785,Soon should bold Hector be impugn’d! Yet you that most are crown’d
300,6,786,"With fortitude of all our host, ev’n you methinks are slow,"
300,6,787,"Not free, and set on fire with lust, t’ encounter such a foe.”"
300,6,788,"With this, nine royal princes rose. Atrides for the first;"
300,6,789,"Then Diomed; th’ Ajaces then, that did th’ encounter thirst;"
300,6,790,King Idomen and his consórts; Mars - like Meriones;
300,6,791,"Evemon’s son, Eurypylus: and Andræmonides,"
300,6,792,"Whom all the Grecians Thoas call’d, sprung of Andræmon’s blood;"
300,6,793,"And wise Ulysses; ev’ry one, propos’d for combat, stood."
300,6,794,Again Gerenius Nestor spake: “Let lots be drawn by all;
300,6,795,"His hand shall help the well - arm’d Greeks, on whom the lot doth fall,"
300,6,796,"And to his wish shall he be help’d, if he escape with life"
300,6,797,The harmful danger - breathing fit of his advent’rous strife.”
300,6,798,"Each mark’d his lot, and cast it into Agamemnon’s casque."
300,6,799,"The soldiers pray’d, held up their hands, and this of Jove did ask,"
300,6,800,"With eyes advanc’d to heav’n: “O Jove, so lead the herald’s hand,"
300,6,801,"That Ajax, or great Tydeus’ son, may our wish’d champion stand,"
300,6,802,Or else the king himself that rules the rich Mycenian land.”
300,6,803,"This said, old Nestor mix’d the lots. The foremost lot survey’d"
300,6,804,"With Ajax Telamon was sign’d, as all the soldiers pray’d;"
300,6,805,"One of the heralds drew it forth, who brought and show’d it round,"
300,6,806,"Beginning at the right hand first, to all the most renown’d."
300,6,807,"None knowing it, ev’ry man denied; but when he forth did pass"
300,6,808,"To him which mark’d and cast it in; which famous Ajax was,"
300,6,809,"He stretch’d his hand, and into it the herald put the lot,"
300,6,810,"Who, viewing it, th’ inscription knew; the duke deniéd not,"
300,6,811,"But joyfully acknowledg’d it, and threw it at his feet,"
300,6,812,"And said: “O friends, the lot is mine, which to my soul is sweet;"
300,6,813,"For now I hope my fame shall rise, in noble Hector’s fall."
300,6,814,"But, whilst I arm myself, do you on great Saturnius call,"
300,6,815,"But silently, or to yourselves, that not a Trojan hear;"
300,6,816,"Or openly, if you think good, since none alive we fear."
300,6,817,"None with a will, if I will not, can my bold pow’rs affright,"
300,6,818,"At least for plain fierce swing of strength, or want of skill in fight;"
300,6,819,"For I will well prove that my birth; and breed, in Salamine"
300,6,820,"Was not all consecrate to meat, or mere effects of wine.”"
300,6,821,"This said, the well - giv’n soldiers pray’d; up went to heav’n their"
300,6,822,eyne:
300,6,823,"“O Jove, that Ida dost protect, most happy, most divine,"
300,6,824,Send victory to Ajax’ side; fame; grace his goodly limb;
300,6,825,"Or (if thy love bless Hector’s life, and thou hast care of him.)"
300,6,826,"Bestow on both like pow’r, like fame.” This said, in bright arms, shone"
300,6,827,"The good strong Ajax; who, when all his war attire was on,"
300,6,828,"March’d like the hugely - figur’d Mars, when angry Jupiter"
300,6,829,"With strength, on people proud of strength, sends him forth to infer"
300,6,830,"Wreakful contention, and comes on with presence full of fear;"
300,6,831,"So th’ Achive rampire, Telamon, did ’twixt the hosts appear;"
300,6,832,"Smil’d; yet of terrible aspéct; on earth, with ample pace,"
300,6,833,"He boldly stalk’d, and shook aloft his dart with deadly grace."
300,6,834,It did the Grecians good to see; but heartquakes shook the joints
300,6,835,"Of all the Trojans, Hector’s self felt thoughts, with horrid points,"
300,6,836,"Tempt his bold bosom; but he now must make no counterflight,"
300,6,837,"Nor, with his honour, now refuse, that had provok’d the fight."
300,6,838,"Ajax came near; and, like a tow’r, his shield his bosom barr’d,"
300,6,839,"The right side brass, and sev’n ox - hides within it quilted hard;[4]"
300,6,840,"Old Tychius, the best currier; that did in Hyla dwell,"
300,6,841,"Did frame it for exceeding proof, and wrought it wondrous well."
300,6,842,"With this stood he to Hector close, and with this brave began:"
300,6,843,"“Now, Hector, thou shalt clearly know, thus meeting man to man,"
300,6,844,"What other leaders arm our host, besides great Thetis’ son,"
300,6,845,Who with his hardy lion’s heart hath armies overrun;
300,6,846,"But he lies at our crook’d - stern’d fleet, a rival with our king"
300,6,847,"In height of spirit; yet to Troy he many knights did bring,"
300,6,848,"Coequal with Æacides, all able to sustain"
300,6,849,"All thy bold challenge can import. Begin then, words are vain,”"
300,6,850,"The helm - grac’d Hector answer’d him: “Renownéd Telamon,"
300,6,851,"Prince of the soldiers came from Greece, assay not me, like one"
300,6,852,"Young and immartial, with great words, as to an Amazon dame;"
300,6,853,"I have the habit of all fights, and know the bloody frame"
300,6,854,"Of ev’ry slaughter; I well know the ready right hand charge,"
300,6,855,"I know the left, and ev’ry sway of my secureful targe;"
300,6,856,"I triumph in the cruelty of fixéd combat fight,"
300,6,857,And manage horse to all designs; I think then with good right
300,6,858,"I may be confident as far as this my challenge goes,"
300,6,859,"Without being taxéd with a vaunt, borne out with empty shows."
300,6,860,"But, being a soldier so renown’d, I will not work on thee"
300,6,861,"With least advantage of that skill I know doth strengthen me,"
300,6,862,"And so, with privity of sleight, win that for which I strive,"
300,6,863,"But at thy best, ev’n open strength, if my endeavours thrive.”"
300,6,864,Thus sent he his long jav’lin forth. It strook his foe’s huge shield
300,6,865,"Near to the upper skirt of brass, which was the eighth it held."
300,6,866,"Six folds th’ untamed dart strook through, and in the sev’nth tough"
300,6,867,hide
300,6,868,The point was check’d. Then Ajax threw; his angry lance did glide
300,6,869,"Quite through his bright orbicular targe, his curace, shirt of mail,"
300,6,870,And did his manly stomach’s mouth with dang’rous taint assail;
300,6,871,"But, in the bowing of himself, black death too short did strike."
300,6,872,"Then both, to pluck their jav’lins forth, encounter’d, lion - like,"
300,6,873,"Whose bloody violence is, increas’d by that raw food they eat,"
300,6,874,Or boars whose strength wild nourishment doth make so wondrous great.
300,6,875,"Again Priamides did wound in midst his shield of brass,"
300,6,876,"Yet pierc’d not through the upper plate, the head reflected was."
300,6,877,"But Ajax, following his lance, smote through his target quite,"
300,6,878,"And stay’d bold Hector rushing in; the lance held way outright,"
300,6,879,"And hurt his neck; out gush’d the blood. Yet Hector ceas’d not so,"
300,6,880,"But in his strong hand took a flint, as he did backwards go,"
300,6,881,"Black, sharp, and big, laid in the field; the sev’nfold targe it smit"
300,6,882,"Full on the boss, and round about the brass did ring with it."
300,6,883,"But Ajax a far greater stone lift up, and (wreathing round,"
300,6,884,"With all his body laid to it) he sent it forth to wound,"
300,6,885,And gave unmeasur’d force to it; the round stone broke within
300,6,886,His rundled target; his lov’d knees to languish did begin;
300,6,887,"And he lean’d, stretch’d out on his shield; but Phœbus rais’d him"
300,6,888,straight.
300,6,889,"Then had they laid on wounds with swords, in use of closer fight,"
300,6,890,Unless the heralds (messengers of Gods and godlike men)
300,6,891,"The one of Troy, the other Greece, had held betwixt them then"
300,6,892,"Imperial sceptres; when the one, Idæus, grave and wise,"
300,6,893,"Said to them: “Now no more, my sons; the Sov’reign of the skies"
300,6,894,"Doth love you both; both soldiers are, all witness with good right;"
300,6,895,But now night lays her mace on earth; ’tis good t’ obey the night.”
300,6,896,"“Idæus,” Telamon replied, “to Hector speak, not me;"
300,6,897,"He that call’d all our Achive peers to station - fight, ’twas he;"
300,6,898,"If he first cease, I gladly yield.” Great Hector then began:"
300,6,899,"“Ajax, since Jove, to thy big form, made thee so strong a man,"
300,6,900,"And gave thee skill to use thy strength, so much, that for thy spear"
300,6,901,"Thou art most excellent of Greece, now let us fight forbear."
300,6,902,"Hereafter we shall war again, till Jove our herald be,"
300,6,903,"And grace with conquest which he will. Heav’n yields to night, and we."
300,6,904,"Go thou and comfort all thy fleet, all friends and men of thine,"
300,6,905,"As I in Troy my favourers, who in the fane divine"
300,6,906,"Have offer’d orisons for me; and come, let us impart"
300,6,907,"Some ensigns of our strife, to show each other’s suppled heart,"
300,6,908,"That men of Troy and Greece may say, Thus their high quarrel ends."
300,6,909,"Those that, encount’ring, were such foes, are now, being sep’rate,"
300,6,910,"friends,”"
300,6,911,"He gave a sword, whose handle was with silver studs through driv’n,[5]"
300,6,912,"Scabbard and all, with hangers rich. By Telamon was giv’n"
300,6,913,"A fair well - glosséd purple waist. Thus Hector went to Troy,"
300,6,914,"And after him a multitude, fill’d with his safety’s joy,"
300,6,915,Despairing he could ever ’scape the puissant fortitude
300,6,916,And unimpeachéd Ajax’ hands. The Greeks like joy renew’d
300,6,917,"For their reputed victory, and brought him to the king;"
300,6,918,"Who to the great Saturnides preferr’d an offering,"
300,6,919,"An ox that fed on five fair springs; they flay’d and quarter’d him,[6]"
300,6,920,"And then, in pieces cut, on spits they roasted ev’ry limb;"
300,6,921,"Which neatly dress’d, they drew it off. Work done, they fell to feast;"
300,6,922,"All had enough; but Telamon, the king fed past the rest"
300,6,923,"With good large pieces of the chine. Thus thirst and hunger stay’d,"
300,6,924,"Nestor, whose counsels late were best, vows new, and first he said:"
300,6,925,"“Atrides, and my other lords, a sort of Greeks are dead,"
300,6,926,"Whose black blood, near Scamander’s stream, inhuman Mars hath shed;"
300,6,927,"Their souls to hell descended are. It fits thee then, our king,"
300,6,928,"To make our soldiers cease from war; and, by the day’s first spring,"
300,6,929,"Let us ourselves, assembled all, the bodies bear to fire,"
300,6,930,"With mules and oxen near our fleet, that, when we home retire,"
300,6,931,"Each man may carry to the sons, of fathers slaughter’d here,"
300,6,932,"Their honour’d bones. One tomb for all, for ever, let us rear,"
300,6,933,Circling the pile without the field; at which we will erect
300,6,934,"Walls, and a rav’lin, that may safe our fleet and us protect."
300,6,935,"And in them let us fashion gates, solid, and barr’d about,"
300,6,936,"Through which our horse, and chariots, may well get in and out."
300,6,937,"Without all, let us dig a dike, so deep it may avail"
300,6,938,"Our forces ’gainst the charge of horse, and foot, that come t’ assail."
300,6,939,"And thus th’ attempts, that I see swell, in Troy’s proud heart, shall"
300,6,940,fail.”
300,6,941,The kings do his advice approve. So Troy doth court convent
300,6,942,"At Priam’s gate, in th’ Ilion tow’r, fearful and turbulent."
300,6,943,"Amongst all, wise Antenor spake: “Trojans, and Dardan friends,"
300,6,944,"And peers assistants, give good ear to what my care commends"
300,6,945,"To your consents, for all our good. Resolve, let us restore"
300,6,946,"The Argive Helen, with her wealth, to him she had before."
300,6,947,"We now defend but broken faiths. If, therefore, ye refuse,"
300,6,948,"No good event can I expect of all the wars, we use.”"
300,6,949,He ceas’d; and Alexander spake; husband to the Argive queen:
300,6,950,"“Antenor, to mine ears thy words harsh and ungracious been."
300,6,951,"Thou canst use better if thou wilt: but, if these truly fit"
300,6,952,"Thy serious thoughts, the Gods with age have reft thy graver wit,"
300,6,953,To warlike Trojans I will speak: I clearly do deny
300,6,954,"To yield my wife, but all her wealth I render willingly,"
300,6,955,"Whatever I from Argos brought, and vow to make it more,"
300,6,956,"Which I have ready in my house, if peace I may restore.”"
300,6,957,"Priam, surnam’d Dardanides, godlike; in counsels grave;"
300,6,958,"In his son’s favour well - advis’d, this resolution gave:"
300,6,959,"“My royal friends of ev’ry state, there is sufficient done,"
300,6,960,"For this late council we have call’d, in th’ offer of my son."
300,6,961,"Now then let all take needful food, then let the watch be set,"
300,6,962,"And ev’ry court of guard held strong; so, when the morn doth wet"
300,6,963,"The high - rais’d battlements of Troy, Idæus shall be sent"
300,6,964,"To th’ Argive fleet, and Atreus’ sons, t’ unfold my son’s intent,"
300,6,965,"From whose fact our contention springs; and, if they will, obtain"
300,6,966,"Respite from heat of fight, till fire consume our soldiers slain;"
300,6,967,"And after, our most fatal war let us importune still,"
300,6,968,Till Jove the conquest have dispos’d to his unconquer’d will.”
300,6,969,"All heard, and did obey the king; and, in their quarters, all,"
300,6,970,"That were to set the watch that night, did to their suppers fall."
300,6,971,"Idæus in the morning went, and th’ Achive peers did find"
300,6,972,In council at Atrides’ ship; his audience was assign’d;
300,6,973,"And, in the midst of all the kings, the vocal herald said:"
300,6,974,"“Atrides! My renownéd king, and other kings, his aid,"
300,6,975,"Propose by me, in their commands, the offers Paris makes,"
300,6,976,From whose joy all our woes proceed. He princely undertakes
300,6,977,That all the wealth he brought from Greece (would he had died before!)
300,6,978,"He will, with other added wealth, for your amends restore"
300,6,979,"But famous Menelaus’ wife he still means to enjoy,"
300,6,980,"Though he be urg’d the contrary, by all the peers of Troy."
300,6,981,"And this besides I have in charge, that, if it please you all,"
300,6,982,"They wish both sides may cease from war, that rites of funeral"
300,6,983,"May on their bodies be perform’d, that ill, the fields lie slain;"
300,6,984,"And after, to the will of Fate, renew the fight again.”"
300,6,985,All silence held at first; at last Tydides made reply:
300,6,986,"“Let no man take the wealth, or dame; for now a child’s weak eye"
300,6,987,May see the imminent black end of Priam’s empery.”
300,6,988,"This sentence, quick and briefly giv’n, the Greeks did all admire."
300,6,989,"Then said, the king: “Herald, thou hear’st the voice entire"
300,6,990,"Of all our peers, to answer thee, for that of Priam’s son."
300,6,991,"But, for our burning of the dead, by all means I am won"
300,6,992,"To satisfy thy king therein, without the slend’rest gain"
300,6,993,"Made of their spoiléd carcasses; but freely, being slain,"
300,6,994,They shall be all consum’d with fire. To which I cite
300,6,995,High thund’ring Jove; that is the king of Juno’s delight.”
300,6,996,"With this, he held his sceptre up, to all the sky - thron’d Pow’rs;"
300,6,997,"And grave Idæus did return to sacred Ilion’s tow’rs,"
300,6,998,"Where Ilians, and Dardanians, did still their counsels ply,"
300,6,999,"Expecting his return. He came, and told his legacy."
300,6,1000,"All, whirlwind - like, assembled then, some bodies to transport,"
300,6,1001,"Some to hew trees. On th’ other part, the Argives did exhort"
300,6,1002,"Their soldiers to the same affairs. Then, did the new fir’d sun"
300,6,1003,"Smite the broad fields, ascending heav’n, and th’ ocean smooth did run;"
300,6,1004,"When Greece and Troy mix’d in such peace, you scarce could either know."
300,6,1005,"Then wash’d they off their blood and dust, and did warm tears bestow"
300,6,1006,"Upon the slaughter’d, and in cars convey’d them from the field."
300,6,1007,"Priam commanded none should mourn, but in still silence yield"
300,6,1008,"Their honour’d carcasses to fire, and only grieve in heart."
300,6,1009,"All burn’d; to Troy Troy’s friends retire, to fleet the Grecian part."
300,6,1010,"Yet doubtful night obscur’d the earth, the day did not appear,"
300,6,1011,"When round about the fun’ral pile, the Grecians gather’d were."
300,6,1012,"The pile they circled with a tomb, and by it rais’d a wall,"
300,6,1013,"High tow’rs, to guard the fleet and them; and in the midst of all"
300,6,1014,"They built strong gates, through which the horse and chariots passage"
300,6,1015,had;
300,6,1016,"Without the rampire a broad dike, long and profound, they made,"
300,6,1017,On which they pallisadoes pitch’d; and thus the Grecians wrought.
300,6,1018,"Their huge works in so little time were to perfection brought,"
300,6,1019,"That all Gods, by the Lightner set, the frame thereof admir’d;"
300,6,1020,"‘Mongst whom the Earthquake - making God, this of their king inquir’d:"
300,6,1021,"“Father of Gods, will any man, of all earth’s grassy sphere,"
300,6,1022,"Ask any of the Gods’ consents to any actions there,"
300,6,1023,"If thou wilt see the shag - hair’d Greeks, with headstrong labours frame"
300,6,1024,"So huge a work, and not to us due off’rings first enflame?"
300,6,1025,"As far as white Aurora’s dews are sprinkled through the air,"
300,6,1026,"Fame will renown the hands of Greece, for this divine affair;"
300,6,1027,"Men will forget the sacred work, the Sun and I did raise"
300,6,1028,For king Laomedon (bright Troy) and this will bear the praise.”
300,6,1029,"Jove was extremely mov’d with him, and said: “What words are these,"
300,6,1030,"Thou mighty Shaker of the earth, thou Lord of all the seas?"
300,6,1031,"Some other God, of far less pow’r, might hold conceits, dismay’d"
300,6,1032,"With this rare Grecian stratagem, and thou rest well apaid;[7]"
300,6,1033,"For it will glorify thy name, as far as light extends;"
300,6,1034,"Since, when these Greeks shall see again their native soil and friends,"
300,6,1035,"The bulwark batter’d, thou mayst quite devour it with thy waves,"
300,6,1036,"And cover, with thy fruitless sands, this fatal shore of graves;"
300,6,1037,"That, what their fi’ry industries have so divinely wrought"
300,6,1038,"In raising it, in razing it thy pow’r will prove it nought.”"
300,6,1039,Thus spake the Gods among themselves. Set was the fervent sun;
300,6,1040,And now the great work of the Greeks was absolutely done.
300,6,1041,"Then slew they oxen in their tents, and strength with food reviv’d,"
300,6,1042,"When out of Lemnos a great fleet of od’rous wine arrived,"
300,6,1043,"Sent by Eunëus, Jason’s son, born of Hypsipyle."
300,6,1044,"The fleet contain’d a thousand tun, which must transported be"
300,6,1045,"To Atreus’ sons, as he gave charge, whose merchandise it was."
300,6,1046,"The Greeks bought wine for shining steel, and some for sounding brass,"
300,6,1047,"Some for ox - hides, for oxen some, and some for prisoners."
300,6,1048,A sumptuous banquet was prepar’d; and all that night the peers
300,6,1049,"And fair - hair’d Greeks consum’d in feast. So Trojans, and their aid."
300,6,1050,And all the night Jove thunder’d loud; pale fear all thoughts dismay’d.
300,6,1051,"While they were gluttonous in earth, Jove wrought their banes in"
300,6,1052,heav’n.
300,6,1053,"They pour’d full cups upon the ground, and were to off’rings driv’n"
300,6,1054,"Instead of quaffings; and to drink, none durst attempt, before"
300,6,1055,In solemn sacrifice they did almighty Jove adore.
300,6,1056,Then to their rests they all repair’d; bold zeal their fear bereav’d;
300,6,1057,"And sudden sleep’s refreshing gift, securely they receiv’d."

300,7,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,7,2,"When Jove to all the Gods had giv’n command,"
300,7,3,"That none to either host should helpful stand,"
300,7,4,To Ida he descends; and sees from thence
300,7,5,Juno and Pallas haste the Greeks’ defence;
300,7,6,"Whose purpose, his command, by Iris given,"
300,7,7,"Doth intervent. Then came the silent even,"
300,7,8,"When Hector charg’d fires should consume the night,"
300,7,9,Lest Greeks in darkness took suspected flight.
300,7,10,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,7,11,"In Theta, Gods a Council have."
300,7,12,Troy’s conquest. Glorious Hector’s brave.
300,7,13,"The cheerful Lady of the light, deck’d in her saffron robe,"
300,7,14,"Dispers’d her beams through ev’ry part of this enflow’red globe,"
300,7,15,When thund’ring Jove a Court of Gods assembled by his will
300,7,16,"In top of all the topful heights, that crown th’ Olympian hill."
300,7,17,"He spake, and all the Gods gave ear: “Hear how I stand inclin’d,"
300,7,18,"That God nor Goddess may attempt t’ infringe my sov’reign mind,"
300,7,19,But all give suffrage that with speed I may these discords end.
300,7,20,What God soever I shall find endeavour to defend
300,7,21,"Or Troy or Greece, with wounds to heav’n he, sham’d, shall reascend;"
300,7,22,"Or, taking with him his offence, I’ll cast him down as deep"
300,7,23,"As Tartarus, the brood of night, where Barathrum doth steep[1]"
300,7,24,"Torment, in his profoundest sinks, where is the floor of brass,"
300,7,25,"And gates of iron; the place, for depth, as far doth hell surpass,"
300,7,26,"As heav’n, for height, exceeds the earth; then shall he know from"
300,7,27,thence
300,7,28,"How much my pow’r, past all the Gods, hath sov’reign eminence."
300,7,29,"Endanger it the whiles and see. Let down our golden chain,"
300,7,30,And at it let all Deities their utmost strengths constrain
300,7,31,"To draw me to the earth from heav’n; you never shall prevail,"
300,7,32,"Though, with your most contention, ye dare my state assail,"
300,7,33,"But when my will shall be dispos’d, to draw you all to me,"
300,7,34,"Ev’n with the earth itself, and seas, ye shall enforced be;"
300,7,35,"Then will I to Olympus’ top our virtuous engine bind,"
300,7,36,"And by it ev’rything shall hang, by my command inclin’d."
300,7,37,"So much I am supreme to Gods, to men supreme as much.”"
300,7,38,"The Gods sat silent, and admir’d, his dreadful speech was such."
300,7,39,At last his blue - ey’d daughter spake: “O great Saturnides!
300,7,40,"O father, O heav’n’s highest king, well know we the excess"
300,7,41,"Of thy great pow’r, compar’d with all; yet the bold Greeks’ estate"
300,7,42,"We needs must mourn, since they must fall beneath so hard a fate;"
300,7,43,"For, if thy grave command enjoin, we will abstain from fight."
300,7,44,"But to afford them such advice, as may relieve their plight,"
300,7,45,"We will, with thy consent, be bold; that all may not sustain"
300,7,46,"The fearful burthen of thy wrath, and with their shames be slain.”"
300,7,47,"He smil’d, and said: “Be confident, thou art belov’d of me;"
300,7,48,"I speak not this with serious thoughts, but will be kind to thee.”"
300,7,49,"This said, his brass - hoof’d wingéd horse he did to chariot bind,"
300,7,50,Whose crests were fring’d with manes of gold; and golden garments
300,7,51,shin’d
300,7,52,"On his rich shoulders; in his hand he took a golden scourge,"
300,7,53,"Divinely fashion’d, and with blows their willing speed did urge"
300,7,54,"Mid way betwixt the earth and heav’n. To Ida: then he came,"
300,7,55,"Abounding in delicious springs, and nurse of beasts untame,"
300,7,56,"Where, on the mountain Gargarus, men did a fane erect"
300,7,57,"To his high name, and altars sweet; and there his horse he check’d,"
300,7,58,"Dissolv’d them from his chariot, and in a cloud of jet"
300,7,59,"He cover’d them, and on the top took his triumphant seat,"
300,7,60,"Beholding Priam’s famous town, and all the fleet of Greece."
300,7,61,"The Greeks took breakfast speedily, and arm’d at ev’ry piece."
300,7,62,"So Trojans; who though fewer far, yet all to fight took arms,"
300,7,63,Dire need enforc’d them to avert their wives’ and children’s harms.
300,7,64,"All gates flew open; all the host did issue, foot and horse,"
300,7,65,In mighty tumult; straight one place adjoin’d each adverse force.
300,7,66,"Then shields with shields met, darts with darts, strength against"
300,7,67,strength oppos’d;
300,7,68,"The boss - pik’d targets were thrust on, and thunder’d as they clos’d"
300,7,69,"In mighty tumult; groan for groan, and breath for breath did breathe,"
300,7,70,"Of men then slain, and to be slain; earth flow’d with fruits of death."
300,7,71,"While the fair morning’s beauty held, and day increas’d in height,"
300,7,72,"Their jav’lins mutually made death transport an equal freight,"
300,7,73,"But when the hot meridian point, bright Phœbus did ascend,"
300,7,74,"Then Jove his golden balances did equally extend,"
300,7,75,"And, of long - rest - conferring death, put in two bitter fates"
300,7,76,For Troy and Greece; he held the midst; the day of final dates
300,7,77,"Fell on the Greeks; the Greeks’ hard lot sunk to the flow’ry ground,"
300,7,78,The Trojans’ leapt as high as heav’n. Then did the claps resound
300,7,79,Of his fierce thunder; lightning leapt amongst each Grecian troop;
300,7,80,"The sight amaz’d them; pallid fear made boldest stomachs stoop,"
300,7,81,"Then Idomen durst not abide, Atrides went his way,"
300,7,82,"And both th’ Ajaces; Nestor yet, against his will did stay,"
300,7,83,"That grave protector of the Greeks, for Paris with a dart"
300,7,84,Enrag’d one of his chariot horse; he smote the upper part
300,7,85,"Of all his skull, ev’n where the hair, that made his foretop, sprung."
300,7,86,"The hurt was deadly, and the pain so sore the courser stung,"
300,7,87,"(Pierc’d to the brain) he stamp’d and plung’d. One on another bears,"
300,7,88,Entangled round about the beam; then Nestor cut the gears
300,7,89,With his new - drawn authentic sword. Meanwhile the fi’ry horse
300,7,90,"Of Hector brake into the press, with their bold ruler’s force;"
300,7,91,"Then good old Nestor had been slain, had Diomed not espy’d,"
300,7,92,"Who to Ulysses, as he fled, importunately cried:"
300,7,93,"“Thou that in counsels dost abound, O Laertiades,"
300,7,94,"Why fly’st thou? Why thus, coward - like, shunn’st thou the honour’d"
300,7,95,prease?
300,7,96,"Take heed thy back take not a dart. Stay, let us both intend"
300,7,97,"To drive this cruel enemy, from our dear agéd friend.”"
300,7,98,"He spake, but wary Ithacus would find no patient ear,"
300,7,99,"But fled forthright, ev’n to the fleet. Yet, though he single were,"
300,7,100,"Brave Diomed mix’d amongst the fight, and stood before the steeds"
300,7,101,"Of old Neleides, whose estate thus kingly he areeds:"
300,7,102,"“O father, with these youths in fight, thou art unequal plac’d,"
300,7,103,"Thy willing sinews are unknit, grave age pursues thee fast,"
300,7,104,"And thy unruly horse are slow; my chariot therefore use,"
300,7,105,"And try how ready Trojan horse, can fly him that pursues,"
300,7,106,"Pursue the flier, and ev’ry way perform the varied fight;"
300,7,107,"I forc’d them from Anchises’ son, well skill’d in cause of flight."
300,7,108,"Then let my squire lead hence thy horse; mine thou shalt guard, whilst"
300,7,109,"I,"
300,7,110,"By thee advanc’d, assay the fight, that Hector’s self may try"
300,7,111,"If my lance dote with the defects, that fail best minds in age,"
300,7,112,"Or finds the palsy in my hands, that doth thy life engage.”"
300,7,113,"This noble Nestor did accept, and Diomed’s two friends,"
300,7,114,"Eurymedon that valour loves, and Sthenelus, ascends"
300,7,115,"Old Nestor’s coach. Of Diomed’s horse Nestor the charge sustains,"
300,7,116,"And Tydeus’ son took place of fight. Neleides held the reins,"
300,7,117,"And scourg’d the horse, who swiftly ran direct in Hector’s face;"
300,7,118,"Whom fierce Tydides bravely charg’d, but, he turn’d from the chace,"
300,7,119,"His jav’lin Eniopeus smit, mighty Thebæus’ son,"
300,7,120,"And was great Hector’s charioteer; it through his breast did run,"
300,7,121,"Near to his pap; he fell to earth, back flew his frighted horse,"
300,7,122,His strength and soul were both dissolv’d. Hector had deep remorse
300,7,123,"Of his mishap; yet left he him, and for another sought;"
300,7,124,"Nor long his steeds did want a guide, for straight good fortune brought"
300,7,125,"Bold Archeptolemus, whose life did from Iphitis spring;"
300,7,126,He made him take the reins and mount. Then souls were set on wing;
300,7,127,Then high exploits were undergone; then Trojans in their walls
300,7,128,"Had been infolded like meek lambs, had Jove wink’d at their falls,"
300,7,129,"Who hurl’d his horrid thunder forth, and made pale lightnings fly."
300,7,130,"Into the earth, before the horse that Nestor did apply."
300,7,131,"A dreadful flash burnt through the air, that savour’d sulphur - like,"
300,7,132,Which down before the chariot the dazzled horse did strike.
300,7,133,"The fair reins fell from Nestor’s hand, who did in fear entreat"
300,7,134,Renown’d Tydides into flight to turn his fury’s heat:
300,7,135,"“For know’st thou not,” said he, “our aid is not supplied from Jove?"
300,7,136,"This day he will give fame to Troy, which when it fits his love"
300,7,137,"We shall enjoy. Let no man tempt his unresisted will,"
300,7,138,Though he exceed in gifts of strength; for he exceeds him still.”
300,7,139,"“Father,” replied the king, “’tis true; but both my heart and soul"
300,7,140,Are most extremely griev’d to think how Hector will control
300,7,141,"My valour with his vaunts in Troy, that I was terror - sick"
300,7,142,"With his approach; which when he boasts, let earth devour me quick.”"
300,7,143,"“Ah! warlike Tydeus’ son,” said he, “what needless words are these?"
300,7,144,"Though Hector should report thee faint, and amorous of thy ease,"
300,7,145,"The Trojans, nor the Trojan wives, would never give him trust,"
300,7,146,Whose youthful husbands thy free hand hath smother’d so in dust.”
300,7,147,"This said, he turn’d his one - hoof’d horse to flight, and troop did"
300,7,148,"take,"
300,7,149,"When Hector and his men, with shouts, did greedy púrsuit make,"
300,7,150,And pour’d on darts that made air sigh. Then Hector did exclaim:
300,7,151,"“O Tydeus’ son, the kings of Greece do most renown thy name"
300,7,152,"With highest place, feasts, and full cups; who now will do thee shame;"
300,7,153,"Thou shalt be like a woman us’d, and they will say: ‘Depart,"
300,7,154,"Immartial minion, since to stand Hector thou hadst no heart.’"
300,7,155,"Nor canst thou scale our turrets’ tops, nor lead the wives to fleet"
300,7,156,Of valiant men; that wife - like fear’st my adverse charge to meet.”
300,7,157,"This two ways mov’d him, — still to fly, or turn his horse and fight."
300,7,158,"Thrice thrust he forward to assault, and ev’ry time the fright"
300,7,159,"Of Jove’s fell thunder drave him back, which he propos’d for sign"
300,7,160,(To show the change of victory) Trojans should victors shine.
300,7,161,"Then Hector comforted his men: “All my advent’rous friends,"
300,7,162,"Be men, and, of your famous strength, think of the honour’d ends."
300,7,163,"I know benevolent Jupiter, did by his beck profess"
300,7,164,"Conquest and high renown to me, and to the Greeks distress."
300,7,165,"O fools, to raise such silly forts, not worth the least account,"
300,7,166,"Nor able to resist our force! With ease our horse may mount,"
300,7,167,"Quite over all their hollow dike. But, when their fleet I reach,"
300,7,168,"Let Memory to all the world a famous bonfire teach,"
300,7,169,"For I will all their ships inflame, with whose infestive smoke,"
300,7,170,"Fear - shrunk, and hidden near their keels, the conquer’d Greeks shall"
300,7,171,choke.”
300,7,172,"Then cherish’d he his famous horse: “O Xanthus, now,” said he,"
300,7,173,"“And thou Podargus, Æthon too, and Lampus, dear to me,"
300,7,174,"Make me some worthy recompense, for so much choice of meat,"
300,7,175,"Giv’n you by fair Andromache; bread of the purest wheat,"
300,7,176,"And with it, for your drink, mix’d wine, to make ye wishéd cheer,"
300,7,177,"Still serving you before myself, her husband young and dear."
300,7,178,"Pursue, and use your swiftest speed, that we may take for prise"
300,7,179,"The shield of old Neleides, which fame lifts to the skies,"
300,7,180,Ev’n to the handles telling it to be of massy gold.
300,7,181,"And from the shoulders let us take, of Diomed the bold,"
300,7,182,"The royal curace Vulcan wrought, with art so exquisite,"
300,7,183,"These if we make our sacred spoil, I doubt not, but this night,"
300,7,184,Ev’n to their navy to enforce the Greeks unturnéd flight.”
300,7,185,"This Juno took in high disdain, and made Olympus shake"
300,7,186,"As she but stirr’d within her throne, and thus to Neptune spake:"
300,7,187,"“O Neptune, what a spite is this! Thou God so huge in pow’r,"
300,7,188,"Afflicts it not thy honour’d heart, to see rude spoil devour"
300,7,189,"These Greeks that have in Helice, and Aege, offer’d thee"
300,7,190,So many and such wealthy gifts? Let them the victors be.
300,7,191,"If we, that are the aids of Greece, would beat home these of Troy,"
300,7,192,"And hinder broad - ey’d Jove’s proud will, it would abate his joy.”"
300,7,193,"He, angry, told her she was rash, and he would not be one"
300,7,194,"Of all the rest, should strive with Jove, whose pow’r was match’d by none."
300,7,195,"Whiles they conferr’d thus, all the space the trench contain’d before"
300,7,196,(From that part of the fort that flank’d the navy - anchoring shore)
300,7,197,"Was filled with horse and targeteers, who there for refuge came,"
300,7,198,By Mars - swift Hector’s pow’r engaged; Jove gave his strength the fame;
300,7,199,"And he with spoilful fire had burn’d the fleet, if Juno’s grace"
300,7,200,"Had not inspir’d the king himself, to run from place to place,"
300,7,201,"And stir up ev’ry soldier’s pow’r, to some illustrious deed."
300,7,202,"First visiting their leaders’ tents, his ample purple weed"
300,7,203,"He wore, to show all who he was, and did his station take"
300,7,204,"At wise Ulysses’ sable barks, that did the battle make"
300,7,205,Of all the fleet; from whence his speech might with more ease be driv’n
300,7,206,"To Ajax’ and Achilles’ ships, to whose chief charge were giv’n"
300,7,207,"The vantguard and the rearguard both, both for their force of hand,"
300,7,208,"And trusty bosoms. There arriv’d, thus urg’d he to withstand"
300,7,209,"Th’ insulting Trojans: “O what shame, ye empty - hearted lords,"
300,7,210,"Is this to your admiréd forms! Where are your glorious words,"
300,7,211,In Lemnos vaunting you the best of all the Grecian host?
300,7,212,"‘We are the strongest men,’ ye said, ‘we will command the most,"
300,7,213,"Eating most flesh of high - horn’d beeves, and drinking cups full crown’d,"
300,7,214,"And ev’ry man a hundred foes, two hundred, will confound;"
300,7,215,"Now all our strength, dar’d to our worst; one Hector cannot tame,’"
300,7,216,"Who presently with horrid fire, will all our fleet inflame."
300,7,217,"O Father Jove, hath ever yet thy most unsuffer’d hand"
300,7,218,"Afflicted, with such spoil of souls, the king of any land,"
300,7,219,"And taken so much fame from him? when I did never fail,"
300,7,220,(Since under most unhappy stars; this fleet was under sail)
300,7,221,"Thy glorious altars, I protest, but, above all the Gods,"
300,7,222,"Have burnt fat thighs of beeves to thee, and pray’d to raze th’ abodes"
300,7,223,"Of rape - defending Ilions. Yet grant, almighty Jove,"
300,7,224,"One favour; — that we may at least with life from hence remove,"
300,7,225,"Not under such inglorious hands, the hands of death employ;"
300,7,226,"And, where Troy should be stoop’d by Greece, let Greece fall under Troy.”"
300,7,227,"To this ev’n weeping king did Jove remorseful audience give,"
300,7,228,"And shook great heav’n to him, for sign his men and he should live."
300,7,229,"Then quickly cast he off his hawk, the eagle prince of air,"
300,7,230,That perfects his unspotted vows; who seiz’d in her repair
300,7,231,"A sucking hind calf, which she truss’d in her enforcive seres,"
300,7,232,"And by Jove’s altar let it fall, amongst th’ amazéd peers,"
300,7,233,"Where the religious Achive kings, with sacrifice did please"
300,7,234,"The author of all oracles, divine Saturnides."
300,7,235,"Now, when they knew the bird of Jove, they turn’d courageous head."
300,7,236,"When none, though many kings put on, could make his vaunt, he led"
300,7,237,"Tydides to renew’d assault, or issu’d first the dike,"
300,7,238,"Or first did fight; but, far the first, stone dead his lance did strike"
300,7,239,"Arm’d Agelaus, by descent surnam’d Phradmonides;"
300,7,240,"He turn’d his ready horse to flight, and Diomed’s lance did seize"
300,7,241,"His back betwixt his shoulder - blades, and look’d out at his breast;"
300,7,242,"He fell, and his arms rang his fall. Th’ Atrides next address’d"
300,7,243,"Themselves to fight; th’ Ajaces next, with vehement strength endued;"
300,7,244,"Idomenëus and his friend, stout Merion, next pursued;"
300,7,245,"And after these Eurypylus, Evemon’s honour’d race;"
300,7,246,"The ninth, with backward - wreathéd bow, had little Teucer place,"
300,7,247,"He still fought under Ajax’ shield, who sometimes held it by,"
300,7,248,"And then he look’d his object out, and let his arrow fly,"
300,7,249,"And, whomsoever in the press he wounded; him he slew,"
300,7,250,"Then under Ajax’ sev’n - fold shield, he presently withdrew."
300,7,251,"He far’d like an unhappy child, that doth to mother run"
300,7,252,"For succour, when he knows full well, he some shrewd turn hath done."
300,7,253,"What Trojans then were to their deaths, by Teucer’s shafts impress’d?"
300,7,254,"Hapless Orsilochus was first, Ormenus, Ophelest,"
300,7,255,"Dæter, and hardy Chromius, and Lycophon divine,"
300,7,256,"And Amopaon that did spring from Polyæmon’s line,"
300,7,257,"And Menalippus; all, on heaps, he tumbled to the ground."
300,7,258,"The king rejoic’d to see his shafts the Phrygian ranks confound,"
300,7,259,"Who straight came near, and spake to him: “O Teucer, lovely man,"
300,7,260,"Strike still so sure, and be a grace to ev’ry Grecian,"
300,7,261,"And to thy father Telamon, who took thee kindly home"
300,7,262,"(Although not by his wife his son) and gave thee foster room,"
300,7,263,"Ev’n from thy childhood; then to him, though far from hence remov’d,"
300,7,264,"Make good fame reach; and to thyself, I vow what shall be prov’d:"
300,7,265,"If he that dreadful Ægis bears, and Pallas, grant to me"
300,7,266,Th’ expugnance of well - builded Troy; I first will honour thee
300,7,267,"Next to myself with some rich gift, and put it in thy hand:"
300,7,268,"A three - foot vessel, that, for grace, in sacred fanes doth stand;"
300,7,269,Or two horse and a chariot; or else a lovely dame
300,7,270,"That may ascend on bed with thee, and amplify thy name.”"
300,7,271,"Teucer right nobly answer’d him: “Why, most illustrate king,"
300,7,272,"I being thus forward of myself, dost thou, adjoin a sting?"
300,7,273,"Without which, all the pow’r I have, I cease not to employ,"
300,7,274,"For, from the place where we repuls’d the Trojans towards Troy,"
300,7,275,"I all the purple field have strew’d, with, one or other slain."
300,7,276,"Eight shafts I shot, with long steel heads, of which not one in vain,"
300,7,277,"All were in youthful bodies fix’d, well skill’d in war’s constraint;"
300,7,278,"Yet this wild dog; with all my aim, I have no pow’r to taint.”"
300,7,279,"This said, another arrow forth, from his stiff string he sent,"
300,7,280,"At Hector, whom he long’d to wound; but still amiss it went."
300,7,281,"His shaft smit fair Gorgythion, of Priam’s princely race,"
300,7,282,"Who in Æpina was brought forth, a famous town in Thrace,"
300,7,283,"By Castianira, that, for form, was like celestial breed;"
300,7,284,"And, as a crimson poppy flow’r, surchargéd with his seed,"
300,7,285,"And vernal humours falling thick, declines his heavy brow,"
300,7,286,"So, of one side, his helmet’s weight his fainting head did bow."
300,7,287,"Yet Teucer would, another shaft at Hector’s life dispose,"
300,7,288,"So fain he such a mark would hit, but still beside it goes;"
300,7,289,"Apollo did avert the shaft; but Hector’s charioteer,"
300,7,290,"Bold Archeptolemus, he smit, as he was rushing near"
300,7,291,"To make the fight; to earth he fell, his swift horse back did fly,"
300,7,292,And there were both his strength and soul exil’d eternally.
300,7,293,"Huge grief, for Hector’s slaughter’d friend, pinch’d - in his mighty"
300,7,294,"mind,"
300,7,295,"Yet was he forc’d to leave him there, and his void place resign’d"
300,7,296,"To his sad brother, that was by, Cebriones; whose ear"
300,7,297,"Receiving Hector’s charge, he straight the weighty reins did bear;"
300,7,298,"And Hector from his shining coach, with horrid voice, leap’d on,"
300,7,299,"To wreak his friend on Teucer’s hand; and up he took a stone,"
300,7,300,With which he at the archer ran; who from his quiver drew
300,7,301,"A sharp - pil’d shaft, and nock’d it sure; but in great Hector flew"
300,7,302,"With such fell speed, that; in his draught, he his right shoulder"
300,7,303,strook
300,7,304,"Where,’twixt his neck and breast, the joint his native closure took."
300,7,305,"The wound was wondrous full of death, his, string in sunder flees,"
300,7,306,"His numméd hand fell strengthless down, and he upon his knees."
300,7,307,"Ajax neglected not to aid his brother thus depress’d,"
300,7,308,"But came and saft him with his shield; and two more friends, address’d"
300,7,309,"To be his aid, took him to fleet, Mecisteus, Echius’ son,"
300,7,310,"And gay Alastor. Teucer sigh’d, for all his service done."
300,7,311,"Then did Olympius, with fresh strength, the Trojan pow’rs revive,"
300,7,312,"Who, to their trenches once again, the troubled Greeks did drive."
300,7,313,"Hector brought terror with his strength, and ever fought before."
300,7,314,"As when some highly stomach’d hound, that hunts a sylvan boar,"
300,7,315,"Or kingly lion, loves the haunch, and pincheth oft behind,"
300,7,316,"Bold of his feet, and still observes the game to turn inclin’d,"
300,7,317,"Not utterly dissolv’d in flight; so Hector did pursue,"
300,7,318,"And whosoever was the last, he ever did subdue,"
300,7,319,"They fled, but, when they had their dike, and palisadoes, pass’d,"
300,7,320,(A number of them put to sword) at ships they stay’d at last.
300,7,321,"Then mutual exhortations flew, then, all with hands and eyes"
300,7,322,"Advanc’d to, all the Gods, their plagues wrung from them open cries."
300,7,323,"Hector, with his four rich - man’d horse, assaulting always rode,"
300,7,324,"The eyes of Gorgon burnt in him, and war’s vermilion God."
300,7,325,"The Goddess that all Goddesses, for snowy arms, out - shin’d,"
300,7,326,"Thus spake to Pallas, to the Greeks with gracious ruth inclin’d:"
300,7,327,"“O Pallas, what a grief is this! Is all our succour past"
300,7,328,"To these our perishing Grecian friends? At least withheld at last,"
300,7,329,"Ev’n now, when one man’s violence must make them perish all,"
300,7,330,In satisfaction of a fate so full of funeral?
300,7,331,"Hector Priamides now raves, no more to be endur’d."
300,7,332,That hath already on the Greeks so many harms inur’d.”
300,7,333,The azure Goddess answer’d her: “This man had surely found
300,7,334,"His fortitude and life dissolv’d, ev’n on his father’s ground,"
300,7,335,"By Grecian valour, if my sire, infested with ill moods,"
300,7,336,"Did not so dote on these of Troy, too jealous of their bloods,"
300,7,337,"And ever an unjust repulse stands to my willing pow’rs,"
300,7,338,"Little rememb’ring what I did, in all the desp’rate hours"
300,7,339,"Of his affected Hercules; I ever rescu’d him,"
300,7,340,"In labours of Eurystheüs, untouch’d in life or limb,"
300,7,341,"When he, heav’n knows, with drownéd eyes look’d up for help to heav’n,"
300,7,342,"Which ever, at command of Jove, was by my suppliance giv’n,"
300,7,343,"But had my wisdom reach’d so far, to, know of this event,"
300,7,344,"When to the solid - ported depths of hell his son was sent,"
300,7,345,"To hale out hateful Pluto’s dog from darksome Erebus,"
300,7,346,"He had not ’scap’d the streams of Styx, so deep and dangerous."
300,7,347,"Yet Jove hates me, and shows his love in doing Thetis’ will,"
300,7,348,"That kiss’d his knees, and strok’d his chin, pray’d, and importun’d"
300,7,349,"till,"
300,7,350,"That he would honour with his aid her city - razing son,"
300,7,351,Displeas’d Achilles; and for him our friends are thus undone.
300,7,352,"But time shall come again, when he, to do his friends some aid,"
300,7,353,"Will call me his Glaucopides, his sweet and blue - eyed Maid."
300,7,354,"Then harness thou thy horse for me, that his bright palace gates"
300,7,355,"I soon may enter, arming me, to order these debates;"
300,7,356,"And I will try if Priam’s son will still maintain his cheer,"
300,7,357,"When in the crimson paths of war, I dreadfully appear;"
300,7,358,"For some proud Trojans shall be sure to nourish dogs and fowls,"
300,7,359,"And pave the shore with fat and flesh, depriv’d of lives and souls.”"
300,7,360,"Juno prepar’d her horse, whose manes ribands of gold enlac’d."
300,7,361,"Pallas her party - colour’d robe on her bright shoulders cast,"
300,7,362,"Divinely wrought with her own hands, in th’ entry of her sire."
300,7,363,"Then put she on her ample breast her under - arming tire,"
300,7,364,"And on it her celestial arms. The chariot straight she takes,"
300,7,365,"With her huge heavy violent lance, with which she slaughter makes"
300,7,366,"Of armies fatal to her wrath. Saturnia whipp’d horse,"
300,7,367,"And heav’n - gates, guarded by the Hours, op’d by their proper force."
300,7,368,Through which they flew. Whom when Jove saw (set near the Idalian
300,7,369,springs)
300,7,370,"Highly, displeas’d, he Iris call’d, that hath the golden wings,"
300,7,371,"And said: “Fly, Iris, turn them back, let them not come at me,"
300,7,372,"Our meetings, sev’rally dispos’d, will nothing gracious be."
300,7,373,"Beneath their o’erthrown chariot I’ll shiver their proud steeds,"
300,7,374,"Hurl down themselves, their waggon break, and, for their stubborn"
300,7,375,"deeds,"
300,7,376,In ten whole years they shall not heal the wounds I will impress
300,7,377,With horrid thunder; that my maid may know when to address
300,7,378,"Arms ’gainst her father. For my wife, she doth not so offend."
300,7,379,’Tis but her use to interrupt whatever I intend.”
300,7,380,"Iris, with this, left Ida’s hills, and up t’ Olympus flew,"
300,7,381,"Met near heav’n - gates the Goddesses, and thus their haste withdrew:"
300,7,382,“What course intend you? Why are you wrapp’d with your fancies’ storm?
300,7,383,"Jove likes not ye should aid the Greeks, but threats, and will perform,"
300,7,384,"To crush in pieces your swift horse beneath their glorious yokes,"
300,7,385,"Hurl down yourselves, your chariot break, and, those impoison’d strokes"
300,7,386,"His wounding thunder shall imprint in your celestial parts,"
300,7,387,In ten full springs ye shall not cure; that She that tames proud hearts
300,7,388,"(Thyself, Minerva) may be taught to know for what, and when,"
300,7,389,Thou dost against thy father fight; for sometimes childeren
300,7,390,"May with discretion plant themselves against their fathers’ wills,"
300,7,391,"But not, where humours only rule, in works beyond their skills."
300,7,392,"For Juno; she offends him not, nor vexeth him so much,"
300,7,393,"For ’tis her use to cross his will, her impudence is such,"
300,7,394,"The habit of offence in this she only doth contract,"
300,7,395,"And so grieves or incenseth less, though ne’er the less her fact."
300,7,396,"But thou most griev’st him, doggéd dame, whom he rebukes in time,"
300,7,397,"Lest silence should pervert thy will, and pride too highly climb"
300,7,398,"In thy bold bosom, desp’rate girl, if seriously thou dare"
300,7,399,"Lift thy unwieldy lance ’gainst Jove, as thy pretences are.”"
300,7,400,"She left them, and Saturnia said: “Ah me! Thou seed of Jove,"
300,7,401,By my advice we will no more unfit convention move
300,7,402,"With Jupiter, for mortal men; of whom, let this man die,"
300,7,403,"And that man live, whoever he pursues with destiny;"
300,7,404,"And let him, plotting all events, dispose of either host,"
300,7,405,"As he thinks fittest for them both, and may become us most.”"
300,7,406,"Thus turn’d she back, and to the Hours her rich - man’d horse resign’d,"
300,7,407,Who them t’ immortal mangers bound; the chariot they inclin’d
300,7,408,Beneath the crystal walls of heav’n; and they in golden thrones
300,7,409,"Consorted other Deities, replete with passións,"
300,7,410,"Jove, in his bright - wheel’d chariot, his fi’ry horse now, beats"
300,7,411,"Up to Olympus, and aspir’d the Gods’ eternal seats."
300,7,412,"Great Neptune loos’d his horse, his car upon the altar plac’d,"
300,7,413,And heav’nly - linen coverings did round about it cast.
300,7,414,The Far - seer us’d his throne of gold. The vast Olympus shook
300,7,415,"Beneath his feet. His wife, and maid, apart places took,"
300,7,416,"Nor any word afforded him. He knew their thoughts, and said:"
300,7,417,“Why do you thus torment yourselves? You need not sit dismay’d
300,7,418,"With the long labours you have us’d in your victorious fight,"
300,7,419,"Destroying Trojans, ’gainst whose lives you heap such high despite."
300,7,420,"Ye should have held your glorious course; for, be assur’d, as far"
300,7,421,"As all my pow’rs, by all means urg’d, could have sustain’d the war,"
300,7,422,Not all the host of Deities should have retir’d my hand
300,7,423,"From vow’d inflictions on the Greeks, much less you two withstand."
300,7,424,"But you, before you saw the fight, much less the slaughter there,"
300,7,425,"Had all your goodly lineaments possess’d with shaking fear,"
300,7,426,"And never had your chariot borne their charge to heav’n again,"
300,7,427,"But thunder should have smit you both, had you one Trojan slain.”"
300,7,428,"Both Goddesses let fall their chins upon their ivory breasts,"
300,7,429,"Set next to Jove, contriving still afflicted Troy’s unrests."
300,7,430,"Pallas for anger could not speak; Saturnia, contrary,"
300,7,431,"Could not for anger hold her peace, but made this bold reply:"
300,7,432,"“Not - to - be - suff’red Jupiter, what need’st thou still enforce"
300,7,433,Thy matchless pow’r? We know it well; but we must yield remorse
300,7,434,To them that yield us sacrifice. Nor need’st thou thus deride
300,7,435,"Our kind obedience, nor our griefs, but bear our pow’rs applied"
300,7,436,"To just protection of the Greeks, that anger tomb not all"
300,7,437,"In Troy’s foul gulf of perjury, and let them stand should fall.”"
300,7,438,"“Grieve not,” said Jove, “at all done yet; for, if thy fair eyes please"
300,7,439,This next red morning they shall see the great Saturnides
300,7,440,"Bring more destruction to the Greeks; and Hector shall not cease,"
300,7,441,"Till he have rouséd from the fleet swift - foot Æacides,"
300,7,442,"In that day, when before their ships, for his Patroclus slain,"
300,7,443,The Greeks in great distress shall fight; for so the Fates ordain.
300,7,444,"I weigh not thy displeaséd spleen, though to th’ extremest bounds"
300,7,445,"Of earth and seas it carry thee, where endless night confounds"
300,7,446,"Japet, and my dejected Sire, who sit so far beneath,"
300,7,447,"They never see the flying sun, nor hear the winds that breath,"
300,7,448,"Near to profoundest Tartarus. Nor, thither if thou went,"
300,7,449,"Would I take pity of thy moods, since none more impudent.”"
300,7,450,To this she nothing did reply. And now Sol’s glorious light
300,7,451,"Fell to the sea, and to the land drew up the drowsy night."
300,7,452,"The Trojans griev’d at Phœbus’ fall, which all the Greeks desir’d,"
300,7,453,"And sable night, so often wish’d, to earth’s firm throne aspir’d."
300,7,454,"Hector (intending to consult) near to the gulfy flood,"
300,7,455,"Far from the fleet, led to a place, pure and exempt from blood,"
300,7,456,"The Trojans’ forces. From their horse all lighted, and did hear"
300,7,457,"Th’ oration Jove - lov’d Hector made; who held a goodly spear,"
300,7,458,"Elev’n full cubits long, the head was brass, and did reflect"
300,7,459,"A wanton light before him still, it round about was deck’d"
300,7,460,"With strong hoops of new - burnish’d gold. On this he lean’d, and said:"
300,7,461,"“Hear me, my worthy friends of Troy, and you our honour’d aid."
300,7,462,"A little since, I had conceit we should have made retreat,"
300,7,463,"By light of the inflaméd fleet, with all the Greeks’ escheat,"
300,7,464,"But darkness hath prevented us; and saft, with special grace,"
300,7,465,These Achives and their shore - hal’d fleet. Let us then render place
300,7,466,"To sacred Night, our suppers dress, and from our chariot free"
300,7,467,"Our fair - man’d horse, and meat them well. Then let there convoy’d be,"
300,7,468,"From forth the city presently, oxen and well - fed sheep,"
300,7,469,"Sweet wine, and bread; and fell much wood, that all night we may keep"
300,7,470,"Plenty of fires, ev’n till the light bring forth the lovely morn,"
300,7,471,"And let their brightness glaze the skies, that night may not suborn"
300,7,472,"The Greeks’ escape, if they for flight the sea’s broad back would take;"
300,7,473,"At least they may not part with ease, but, as retreat they make,"
300,7,474,"Each man may bear a wound with him, to cure when he comes home,"
300,7,475,"Made with a shaft or sharp’ned spear; and others fear to come,"
300,7,476,"With charge of lamentable war, ’gainst soldiers bred in Troy."
300,7,477,Then let our heralds through the town their offices employ
300,7,478,"To warn the youth, yet short of war, and time - white fathers, past,"
300,7,479,"That in our god - built tow’rs they see strong courts of guard be plac’d,"
300,7,480,"About the walls; and let our dames, yet flourishing in years,"
300,7,481,"That, having beauties to keep pure, are most inclin’d to fears"
300,7,482,(Since darkness in distressful times more dreadful is than light)
300,7,483,"Make lofty fires in ev’ry house; and thus, the dang’rous night,"
300,7,484,"Held with strong watch, if th’ enemy have ambuscadoes laid"
300,7,485,"Near to our walls (and therefore seem in flight the more dismay’d,"
300,7,486,"Intending a surprise, while we are all without the town)"
300,7,487,"They ev’ry way shall be impugn’d, to, ev’ry man’s renown."
300,7,488,"Perform all this, brave Trojan friends. What now I have to say"
300,7,489,Is all express’d; the cheerful morn shall other things display.
300,7,490,"It is my glory (putting trust in Jove, and other Gods)"
300,7,491,"That I shall now expulse these dogs Fates sent to our abodes,"
300,7,492,"Who bring ostents of destiny, and black their threat’ning fleet."
300,7,493,But this night let us hold strong guards; to - morrow we will meet
300,7,494,"(With fierce - made war) before their ships, and I’ll make known to all"
300,7,495,"If strong Tydides from their ships can drive me to their wall,"
300,7,496,"Or I can pierce him with my sword, and force his bloody spoil."
300,7,497,"The wishéd morn shall show his pow’r, if he can shun his foil"
300,7,498,"I running on him with my lance. I think; when day ascends,"
300,7,499,"He shall lie wounded with the first, and by him many friends."
300,7,500,"O that I were as sure to live immortal, and sustain"
300,7,501,"No frailties with increasing years, but evermore remain"
300,7,502,"Ador’d like Pallas, or the Sun, as all doubts die in me"
300,7,503,That heav’n’s next light shall be the last the Greeks shall ever see!”
300,7,504,This speech all Trojans did applaud; who from their traces los’d
300,7,505,"Their sweating horse, which sev’rally with headstalls they repos’d,"
300,7,506,And fast’ned by their chariots; when others brought from town
300,7,507,"Fat sheep and oxen, instantly, bread, wine; and hewéd down"
300,7,508,Huge store of wood. The winds transferr’d into the friendly sky
300,7,509,"Their supper’s savour; to the which they sat delightfully,"
300,7,510,And spent all night in open field; fires round about them shin’d.
300,7,511,"As when about the silver moon, when air is free from wind,"
300,7,512,"And stars shine clear, to whose sweet beams, high prospects, and the"
300,7,513,brows
300,7,514,"Of all steep hills and pinnacles, thrust up themselves for shows,"
300,7,515,"And ev’n the lowly valleys joy to glitter in their sight,"
300,7,516,"When the unmeasur’d firmament bursts to disclose her light,"
300,7,517,"And all the signs in heav’n are seen, that glad the shepherd’s heart;"
300,7,518,"So many fires disclos’d their beams, made by the Trojan part,"
300,7,519,"Before the face of Ilion, and her bright turrets show’d."
300,7,520,"A thousand courts of guard kept fires, and ev’ry guard allow’d"
300,7,521,"Fifty stout men, by whom their horse ate oats and hard white corn,"
300,7,522,And all did wishfully expect the silver - thronéd morn.

300,8,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,8,2,"To Agamemnon, urging hopeless flight,"
300,8,3,"Stand Diomed, and Nestor, opposite."
300,8,4,"By Nestor’s counsel, legates are dismiss’d"
300,8,5,To Thetis’ son; who still denies t’ assist.
300,8,6,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,8,7,"Iota sings the Ambassy,"
300,8,8,And great Achilles’ stern reply.
300,8,9,"So held the Trojans sleepless guard; the Greeks to flight were giv’n,"
300,8,10,"The feeble consort of cold fear, strangely infus’d from heav’n;"
300,8,11,"Grief, not to be endur’d, did wound all Greeks of greatest worth."
300,8,12,"And as two lateral - sited winds, the west wind and the north,"
300,8,13,"Meet at the Thracian sea’s black breast, join in a sudden blore,"
300,8,14,"Tumble together the dark waves, and pour upon the shore"
300,8,15,"A mighty deal of froth and weed, with which men manure ground;"
300,8,16,"So Jove, and Troy did drive the Greeks, and all their minds confound."
300,8,17,"But Agamemnon most of all was tortur’d at his heart,"
300,8,18,"Who to the voiceful heralds went, and bade them cite, apart,"
300,8,19,"Each Grecian leader sev’rally, not openly proclaim."
300,8,20,In which he labour’d with the first; and all together came.
300,8,21,"They sadly sate. The king arose, and pour’d out tears as fast"
300,8,22,"As from a lofty rock a spring doth his black waters cast,"
300,8,23,"And, deeply sighing, thus bespake the Achives: “O my friends,"
300,8,24,"Princes, and leaders of the Greeks, heav’n’s adverse King extends"
300,8,25,"His wrath, with too much detriment, to my so just design,"
300,8,26,"Since he hath often promis’d me, and bound it with the sign"
300,8,27,"Of his bent forehead, that this Troy our vengeful hands should race,"
300,8,28,"And safe return; yet, now engag’d, he plagues us with disgrace,"
300,8,29,When all our trust to him hath drawn so much blood from our friends.
300,8,30,"My glory, nor my brother’s wreak, were the proposéd ends,"
300,8,31,"For which he drew you to these toils, but your whole countries’ shame,"
300,8,32,"Which had been huge to bear the rape of so divine a dame,"
300,8,33,Made in despite of our revenge. And yet not that had mov’d
300,8,34,"Our pow’rs to these designs, if Jove had not our drifts approv’d;"
300,8,35,"Which since we see he did for blood, ’tis desp’rate fight in us"
300,8,36,To strive with him; then let us fly; ’tis flight he urgeth thus.”
300,8,37,Long time still silence held them all; at last did Diomed rise:
300,8,38,"“Atrides, I am first must cross thy indiscreet advice,[1]"
300,8,39,"As may become me, being a king, in this our martial court."
300,8,40,Be not displeas’d then; for thyself didst broadly misreport
300,8,41,"In open field my fortitude, and call’d me faint and weak,"
300,8,42,"Yet I was silent, knowing the time, loth any rites to break"
300,8,43,"That appertain’d thy public rule, yet all the Greeks knew well,"
300,8,44,"Of ev’ry age, thou didst me wrong. As thou then didst refell"
300,8,45,"My valour first of all the host, as of a man dismay’d;"
300,8,46,"So now, with fit occasion giv’n, I first blame thee afraid."
300,8,47,"Inconstant Saturn’s son hath giv’n inconstant spirits to thee,"
300,8,48,"And, with a sceptre over all, an eminent degree;"
300,8,49,"But with a sceptre’s sov’reign grace, the chief pow’r, fortitude,"
300,8,50,(To bridle thee) he thought not best thy breast should be endu’d.
300,8,51,"Unhappy king, think’st thou the Greeks are such a silly sort,"
300,8,52,"And so excessive impotent, as thy weak words import?"
300,8,53,"If thy mind move thee to be gone, the way is open, go;"
300,8,54,"Mycenian ships enow ride near, that brought thee to this woe;"
300,8,55,"The rest of Greece will stay, nor stir till Troy be overcome"
300,8,56,"With full eversion; or if not, but (doters of their home)"
300,8,57,Will put on wings to fly with thee. Myself and Sthenelus
300,8,58,Will fight till (trusting favouring Jove) we bring home Troy with us.”
300,8,59,"This all applauded, and admir’d the spirit of Diomed;"
300,8,60,"When Nestor, rising from the rest, his speech thus seconded:"
300,8,61,"“Tydides, thou art, questionless, our strongest Greek in war,"
300,8,62,"And gravest in thy counsels too, of all that equal are"
300,8,63,"In place with thee, and stand on strength; nor is there any one"
300,8,64,"Can blame, or contradict thy speech; and yet thou hast not gone"
300,8,65,"So far, but we must further go. Thou’rt young, and well mightst be"
300,8,66,"My youngest son, though still I yield thy words had high degree"
300,8,67,"Of wisdom in them to our king, since well they did become"
300,8,68,"Their right in question, and refute inglorious going home."
300,8,69,"But I (well known thy senior far) will speak, and handle all"
300,8,70,"Yet to propose, which none shall check; no, not our general."
300,8,71,"A hater of society, unjust, and wild, is he"
300,8,72,"That loves intestine war, being stuff’d with manless cruelty."
300,8,73,"And therefore in persuading peace, and home - flight, we the less"
300,8,74,"May blame our gen’ral, as one loth to wrap in more distress"
300,8,75,His lovéd soldiers. But because they bravely are resolv’d
300,8,76,"To cast lives after toils, before they part in shame involv’d,"
300,8,77,"Provide we for our honour’d stay; obey black night, and fall"
300,8,78,"Now to our suppers; then appoint our guards without the wall,"
300,8,79,And in the bottom of the dike; which guard I wish may stand
300,8,80,"Of our brave youth. And, Atreus’ son, since thou art in command"
300,8,81,"Before our other kings, be first in thy command’s effect."
300,8,82,"It well becomes thee; since ’tis both what all thy peers expect,"
300,8,83,And in the royal right of things is no impair to thee.
300,8,84,"Nor shall it stand with less than right, that they invited be"
300,8,85,"To supper by thee; all thy tents are amply stor’d with wine,"
300,8,86,Brought daily in Greek ships from Thrace; and to this grace of thine
300,8,87,"All necessaries thou hast fit, and store of men to wait;"
300,8,88,"And, many meeting there, thou may’st hear ev’ry man’s conceit,"
300,8,89,And take the best. It much concerns all Greeks to use advice
300,8,90,"Of gravest nature, since so near our ships our enemies"
300,8,91,"Have lighted such a sort of fires, with which what man is joy’d?"
300,8,92,"Look, how all bear themselves this night; so live, or be destroy’d.”"
300,8,93,"All heard, and follow’d his advice. There was appointed then"
300,8,94,"Sev’n captains of the watch, who forth did march with all their men."
300,8,95,"The first was famous Thrasymed, adviceful Nestor’s son;"
300,8,96,Ascalaphus; and Ialmen; and mighty Merion;
300,8,97,"Alphareus; and Deipyrus; and lovely Lycomed,"
300,8,98,"Old Creon’s joy. These sev’n bold lords an hundred soldiers led,"
300,8,99,"In ev’ry sever’d company, and ev’ry man his pike,"
300,8,100,"Some placéd on the rampire’s top, and some amidst the dike."
300,8,101,"All fires made, and their suppers took. Atrides to his tent"
300,8,102,"Invited all the peers of Greece, and food sufficient"
300,8,103,"Appos’d before them, and the peers appos’d their hands to it."
300,8,104,"Hunger and thirst being quickly quench’d, to counsel still they sit."
300,8,105,"And first spake Nestor, who they thought of late advis’d so well,"
300,8,106,"A father grave, and rightly wise, who thus his tale did tell:"
300,8,107,"“Most high Atrides, since in thee I have intent to end,"
300,8,108,"From thee will I begin my speech, to whom Jove doth commend"
300,8,109,"The empire of so many men, and puts into thy hand"
300,8,110,"A sceptre, and establish’d laws, that thou mayst well command,"
300,8,111,And counsel all men under thee. It therefore doth behove
300,8,112,"Thyself to speak most, since of all thy speeches most will move;"
300,8,113,"And yet to hear, as well as speak; and then perform as well"
300,8,114,A free just counsel; in thee still must stick what others tell.
300,8,115,"For me, what in my judgment stands the most convenient"
300,8,116,"I will advise, and am assur’d advice more competent"
300,8,117,"Shall not be giv’n; the gen’ral proof, that hath before been made"
300,8,118,"Of what I speak, confirms me still, and now may well persuade,"
300,8,119,"Because I could not then, yet ought, when thou, most royal king,"
300,8,120,"Ev’n from the tent, Achilles’ love didst violently bring,"
300,8,121,"Against my counsel, urging thee by all means to relent;"
300,8,122,"But you, obeying your high mind, would venture the event,"
300,8,123,"Dishonouring our ablest Greek, a man th’ Immortals grace."
300,8,124,"Again yet let’s deliberate, to make him now embrace"
300,8,125,"Affection to our gen’ral good, and bring his force to field;"
300,8,126,Both which kind words and pleasing gifts must make his virtues yield.”
300,8,127,"“O father,” answeréd the king, “my wrongs thou tell’st me right."
300,8,128,Mine own offence mine own tongue grants. One man must stand in fight
300,8,129,"For our whole army; him I wrong’d; him Jove loves from his heart,"
300,8,130,"He shows it in thus honouring him; who, living thus apart,"
300,8,131,"Proves us but number, for his want makes all our weakness seen."
300,8,132,"Yet after my confess’d offence, soothing my hum’rous spleen,"
300,8,133,"I’ll sweeten his affects again with presents infinite,"
300,8,134,"Which, to prove my firm intent, I’ll openly recite:"
300,8,135,Sev’n sacred tripods free from fire; ten talents of fine gold;
300,8,136,"Twenty bright cauldrons; twelve young horse, well - shap’d, and"
300,8,137,"well - controll’d,"
300,8,138,"And victors too, for they have won the prize at many a race,"
300,8,139,That man should not be poor that had but what their wingéd pace
300,8,140,"Hath added to my treasury, nor feel sweet gold’s defect."
300,8,141,"Sev’n Lesbian ladies he shall have, that were the most select,"
300,8,142,"And in their needles rarely skill’d, whom, when he took the town"
300,8,143,"Of famous Lesbos, I did choose; who won the chief renown"
300,8,144,For beauty from their whole fair sex; amongst whom I’ll resign
300,8,145,"Fair Brisis, and I deeply swear (for any fact of mine"
300,8,146,"That may discourage her receipt) she is untouch’d, and rests"
300,8,147,As he resign’d her. To these gifts (if Jove to our requests
300,8,148,"Vouchsafe performance, and afford the work, for which we wait,"
300,8,149,Of winning Troy) with brass and gold he shall his navy freight;
300,8,150,"And, ent’ring when we be at spoil, that princely hand of his"
300,8,151,"Shall choose him twenty Trojan dames, excepting Tyndaris,"
300,8,152,"The fairest Pergamus enfolds; and, if we make retreat"
300,8,153,"To Argos, call’d of all the world the Navel, or chief seat,"
300,8,154,"He shall become my son - in - law, and I will honour him"
300,8,155,"Ev’n as Orestes, my sole son, that cloth in honours swim."
300,8,156,"Three daughters in my well - built court unmarried are, and fair;"
300,8,157,"Laodice, Chrysothemis that hath the golden hair,"
300,8,158,And Iphianassa; of all three the worthiest let him take
300,8,159,"All - jointureless to Peleus’ court; I will her jointure make,"
300,8,160,"And that so great as never yet did any maid prefer,"
300,8,161,"Sev’n cities right magnificent, I will bestow on her;"
300,8,162,"Enope, and Cardamyle, Mira for herbs renown’d,"
300,8,163,"The fair Æpea, Pedasus that doth with grapes abound,"
300,8,164,"Anthæa girded with green meads, Phera surnam’d Divine;"
300,8,165,"All whose bright turrets on the sea, in sandy Pylos, shine."
300,8,166,"Th’ inhabitants in flocks and herds are wondrous confluent,"
300,8,167,"Who like a God will honour him, and him with gifts present,"
300,8,168,And to his throne will contribute what tribute he will rate.
300,8,169,"All this I gladly will perform, to pacify his hate."
300,8,170,Let him be mild and tractable; ’tis for the God of ghosts
300,8,171,"To be unrul’d, implacable, and seek the blood of hosts,"
300,8,172,"Whom therefore men do much abhor; then let him yield to me,"
300,8,173,"I am his greater, being a king, and more in years than he.”"
300,8,174,"“Brave king,” said Nestor, “these rich gifts must make him needs relent,"
300,8,175,"Choose then fit legates instantly to greet him at his tent,"
300,8,176,"But stay; admit my choice of them, and let them straight be gone."
300,8,177,"Jove - lovéd Phœnix shall be chief, then Ajax Telamon,"
300,8,178,"And prince Ulysses; and on them let these two heralds wait,"
300,8,179,"Grave Odius and Eurybates, Come, lords, take water straight,"
300,8,180,"Make pure your hand, and with sweet words appease Achilles’ mind,"
300,8,181,Which we will pray the king of Gods may gently make inclin’d.”
300,8,182,"All lik’d his speech; and on their hands the heralds water shed,"
300,8,183,The youths crown’d cups of sacred wine to all distributed.
300,8,184,"But having sacrific’d, and drunk to ev’ry man’s content,"
300,8,185,"With many notes by Nestor giv’n, the legates forward went."
300,8,186,"With courtship in fit gestures us’d he did prepare them well,"
300,8,187,"But most Ulysses, for his grace did not so much excel."
300,8,188,"Such rites beseem ambassadors; and Nestor urgéd these,"
300,8,189,That their most honours might reflect enrag’d Æacides.
300,8,190,"They went along the shore, and pray’d the God, that earth doth bind"
300,8,191,"In brackish chains, they might not fail, but bow his mighty mind."
300,8,192,"The quarter of the Myrmidons they reach’d, and found him set"
300,8,193,"Delighted with his solemn harp, which curiously was fret"
300,8,194,"With works conceited, through the verge; the bawdrick that embrac’d"
300,8,195,"His lofty neck was silver twist; this, when his hand laid waste"
300,8,196,"Aëtion’s city, he did choose as his especial prise,"
300,8,197,"And, loving sacred music well, made it his exercise."
300,8,198,"To it he sung the glorious deeds of great heroës dead,"
300,8,199,"And his true mind, that practice fail’d, sweet contemplation fed."
300,8,200,"With him alone, and opposite, all silent sat his friend,"
300,8,201,"Attentive, and beholding him, who now his song did end."
300,8,202,"Th’ ambassadors did forwards press, renown’d Ulysses led,"
300,8,203,"And stood in view. Their sudden sight his admiration bred,"
300,8,204,Who with his harp and all arose; so did Menœtius’ son
300,8,205,When he beheld them. Their receipt Achilles thus begun:
300,8,206,"“Health to my lords! Right welcome men, assure yourselves you be,"
300,8,207,"Though some necessity, I know, doth make you visit me,"
300,8,208,"Incens’d with just cause ’gainst the Greeks.” This said, a sev’ral seat"
300,8,209,"With purple cushions he set forth, and did their ease intreat,"
300,8,210,"And said: “Now, friend, our greatest bowl, with wine unmix’d and neat,"
300,8,211,"Appose these lords, and of the depth let every man make proof,"
300,8,212,"These are my best esteeméd friends, and underneath my roof.”"
300,8,213,Patroclus did his dear friend’s will; and he that did desire
300,8,214,"To cheer the lords, come faint from fight, set on a blazing fire"
300,8,215,"A great brass pot, and into it a chine of mutton put,"
300,8,216,"And fat goat’s flesh. Automedon held, while he pieces cut,"
300,8,217,"To roast and boil, right cunningly; then of a well - fed swine"
300,8,218,"A huge fat shoulder he cuts out, and spits it wondrous fine."
300,8,219,"His good friend made a goodly fire; of which the force once past,"
300,8,220,"He laid the spit low, near the coals, to make it brown at last,"
300,8,221,"Then sprinkled it with sacred salt, and took it from the racks."
300,8,222,"This roasted and on dresser set, his friend Patroclus takes"
300,8,223,"Bread in fair baskets; which set on, Achilles brought the meat,"
300,8,224,And to divinest Ithacus took his opposéd seat
300,8,225,"Upon the bench. Then did he will his friend to sacrifice,"
300,8,226,Who cast sweet incense in the fire to all the Deities.
300,8,227,"Thus fell they to their ready food. Hunger and thirst allay’d,"
300,8,228,"Ajax to Phœnix made a sign, as if too long they stay’d"
300,8,229,"Before they told their legacy. Ulysses saw him wink,"
300,8,230,"And, filling the great bowl with wine, did to Achilles drink:"
300,8,231,"“Health to Achilles! But our plights stand not in need of meat,"
300,8,232,"Who late supp’d at Atrides’ tent, though for thy love we eat"
300,8,233,"Of many things, whereof a part would make a cómplete feast."
300,8,234,"Nor can we joy in these kind rites, that have our hearts oppress’d,"
300,8,235,"O prince, with fear of utter spoil. ’Tis made a question now,"
300,8,236,"If we can save our fleet or not, unless thyself endow"
300,8,237,"Thy pow’rs with wonted fortitude. Now Troy and her consórts,"
300,8,238,"Bold of thy want, have pitch’d their tents close to our fleet and"
300,8,239,"forts,"
300,8,240,"And made a firmament of fires; and now no more, they say,"
300,8,241,"Will they be prison’d in their walls, but force their violent way"
300,8,242,Ev’n to our ships; and Jove himself hath with his lightnings show’d
300,8,243,Their bold adventures happy signs; and Hector grows so proud
300,8,244,"Of his huge strength, borne out by Jove, that  fearfully he raves,"
300,8,245,Presuming neither men nor Gods can interrupt his braves.
300,8,246,"Wild rage invades him, and he prays that soon the sacred Morn"
300,8,247,"Would light his fury; boasting then our streamers shall be torn,"
300,8,248,"And all our naval ornaments fall by his conqu’ring stroke,"
300,8,249,"Our ships shall burn, and we ourselves lie stifled in the smoke."
300,8,250,"And I am seriously afraid, Heav’n will perform his threats,"
300,8,251,"And that ’tis fatal to us all, far from our native seats,"
300,8,252,"To perish in victorious Troy. But rise, though it be late,"
300,8,253,Deliver the afflicted Greeks from Troy’s tumultuous hate;
300,8,254,"It will hereafter be thy grief, when no strength can suffice"
300,8,255,To remedy th’ effected threats of our calamities.
300,8,256,"Consider these affairs in time, while thou mayst use thy pow’r."
300,8,257,And have the grace to turn from Greece fate’s unrecover’d hour.
300,8,258,"O friend, thou know’st thy royal sire forewarn’d what should be done,"
300,8,259,That day he sent thee from his court to honour Atreus’ son:
300,8,260,"‘My son,’ said he, ‘the victory let Jove and Pallas use"
300,8,261,"At their high pleasures, but do thou no honour’d means refuse"
300,8,262,"That may advance her. In fit bounds contain thy mighty mind,"
300,8,263,"Nor let the knowledge of thy strength be factiously inclin’d,"
300,8,264,Contriving mischiefs. Be to fame and gen’ral good profess’d.
300,8,265,The more will all sorts honour thee. Benignity is best.’
300,8,266,"Thus charg’d thy sire, which thou forgett’st. Yet now those thoughts"
300,8,267,"appease,"
300,8,268,"That torture thy great spirit with wrath; which if thou wilt surcease,"
300,8,269,"The king will merit it with gifts; and, if thou wilt give ear,"
300,8,270,I’ll tell how much he offers thee yet thou sitt’st angry here:
300,8,271,"Sev’n tripods that no fire must touch; twice - ten pans, fit for flame;"
300,8,272,"Ten talents of fine gold; twelve horse that ever overcame,"
300,8,273,"And brought huge prises from the field, with swiftness of their feet,"
300,8,274,"That man should bear no poor account, nor want gold’s quick’ning sweet,"
300,8,275,"That had but what he won with them; sev’n worthiest Lesbian dames,"
300,8,276,"Renown’d for skill in housewif’ry, and bear the sov’reign fames"
300,8,277,"For beauty from their gen’ral sex, which, at thy overthrow"
300,8,278,"Of well - built Lesbos, he did choose; and these he will bestow,"
300,8,279,"And with these her he took from thee, whom, by his state, since then,"
300,8,280,"He swears he touch’d not, as fair dames use to be touch’d by men."
300,8,281,"All these are ready for thee now. And, if at length we take,"
300,8,282,"By helps of Gods, this wealthy town, thy ships shall burthen make"
300,8,283,"Of gold and brass at thy desires, when we the spoil divide;"
300,8,284,"And twenty beauteous Trojan dames thou shalt select beside,"
300,8,285,"Next Helen, the most beautiful; and, when return’d we be"
300,8,286,"To Argos, be his son - in - law, for he will honour thee"
300,8,287,"Like his Orestes, his sole son, maintained in height of bliss."
300,8,288,"Three daughters beautify his court, the fair Chrysothemis,"
300,8,289,"Laodice, and Iphianesse; of all the fairest take"
300,8,290,"To Peleus’ thy grave father’s court, and never jointure make;"
300,8,291,"He will the jointure make himself, so great, as never sire"
300,8,292,Gave to his daughter’s nuptials. Sev’n cities left entire;
300,8,293,"Cardamyle, and Enope, and Hira full of flow’rs,"
300,8,294,"Anthæa for sweet meadows prais’d, and Phera deck’d with tow’rs,"
300,8,295,"The bright Epea, Pedasus that doth God Bacchus please;"
300,8,296,"All, on the sandy Pylos’ soil, are seated near the seas;"
300,8,297,"Th’ inhabitants in droves and flocks exceeding wealthy be,"
300,8,298,"Who, like a God, with worthy gifts will gladly honour thee,"
300,8,299,And tribute of especial rate to thy high sceptre pay.
300,8,300,"All this he freely will perform, thy anger to allay."
300,8,301,"But if thy hate to him be more than his gifts may repress,"
300,8,302,"Yet pity all the other Greeks, in such extreme distress,"
300,8,303,Who with religion honour thee; and to their desp’rate ill
300,8,304,"Thou shalt triumphant glory bring; and Hector thou may’st kill,"
300,8,305,"When pride makes him encounter thee, fill’d with a baneful sprite,"
300,8,306,"Who vaunts our whole fleet brought not one, equal to him in fight.”"
300,8,307,"Swift - foot Æacides replied: “Divine Laertes’ son,"
300,8,308,"’Tis requisite I should be short, and show what place hath won"
300,8,309,"Thy serious speech, affirming nought but what you shall approve"
300,8,310,"Establish’d in my settled heart, that in the rest I move"
300,8,311,"No murmur nor exceptión; for, like hell mouth I loath,"
300,8,312,Who holds not in his words and thoughts one indistinguish’d troth.
300,8,313,"What fits the freeness of my mind, my speech shall make display’d."
300,8,314,"Nor Atreus’ son, nor all the Greeks, shall win me to their aid,"
300,8,315,"Their suit is wretchedly enforc’d, to free their own despairs,"
300,8,316,And my life never shall be hir’d with thankless desp’rate pray’rs;
300,8,317,"For never had I benefit, that ever foil’d the foe;"
300,8,318,"Ev’n share hath he that keeps his tent, and he to field doth go,"
300,8,319,"With equal honour cowards die, and men most valiant,"
300,8,320,"The much performer, and the man that can of nothing vaunt."
300,8,321,"No overplus I ever found, when, with my mind’s most strife"
300,8,322,"To do them good, to dang’rous fight I have expos’d my life."
300,8,323,"But ev’n as to unfeather’d birds the careful dam brings meat,"
300,8,324,"Which when she hath bestow’d, herself hath nothing left to eat;"
300,8,325,"So, when my broken sleeps have drawn the nights t’ extremest length,"
300,8,326,"And ended many bloody days with still - employéd strength,"
300,8,327,"To guard their weakness, and preserve their wives’ contents infract,"
300,8,328,I have been robb’d before their eyes: Twelve cities I have sack’d
300,8,329,"Assail’d by sea, elev’n by land, while this siege held at Troy;"
300,8,330,"And of all these, what was most dear, and most might crown the joy"
300,8,331,"Of Agamemnon, he enjoy’d, who here behind remain’d:"
300,8,332,"Which when he took, a few he gave, and many things retain’d,"
300,8,333,"Other to optimates and kings he gave, who hold them fast,"
300,8,334,Yet mine he forceth; only I sit with my loss disgrac’d.
300,8,335,"But so he gain a lovely dame, to be his bed’s delight,"
300,8,336,It is enough; for what cause else do Greeks and Trojans fight?
300,8,337,Why brought he hither such an host? Was it not for a dame?
300,8,338,For fair - hair’d Helen? And doth love alone the hearts inflame
300,8,339,"Of the Atrides to their wives, of all the men that move?"
300,8,340,"Ev’ry discreet and honest mind cares for his private love,"
300,8,341,"As much as they; as I myself lov’d Brisis as my life,"
300,8,342,"Although my captive, and had will to take her for my wife."
300,8,343,"Whom since he forc’d, preventing me, in vain he shall prolong"
300,8,344,Hopes to appease me that know well the deepness of my wrong.
300,8,345,"But, good Ulysses, with thyself, and all you other kings,"
300,8,346,Let him take stomach to repel Troy’s fi’ry threatenings.
300,8,347,"Much hath he done without my help, built him a goodly fort,"
300,8,348,"Cut a dike by it, pitch’d with pales, broad and of deep import;"
300,8,349,And cannot all these helps repress this kill - man Hector’s fright?
300,8,350,"When I was arm’d among the Greeks, he would not offer fight"
300,8,351,"Without the shadow of his walls; but to the Scæan ports,"
300,8,352,"Or to the holy beach of Jove, come back’d with his consorts;"
300,8,353,"Where once he stood my charge alone, and hardly made retreat,"
300,8,354,"And to make new proof of our pow’rs, the doubt is not so great."
300,8,355,"To - morrow then, with sacrifice perform’d t’ imperial Jove"
300,8,356,"And all the Gods, I’ll launch my fleet, and all my men remove;"
300,8,357,"Which (if thou wilt use so thy sight, or think’st it worth respect)"
300,8,358,"In forehead of the morn, thine eyes shall see, with sails erect"
300,8,359,"Amidst the fishy Hellespont, help’d with laborious oars."
300,8,360,"And, if the Sea - god send free sail, the fruitful Phthian shores"
300,8,361,"Within three days we shall attain, where I have store of prise"
300,8,362,"Left, when with prejudice I came to these indignities."
300,8,363,"There have I gold as well as here, and store of ruddy brass,"
300,8,364,"Dames slender, elegantly girt, and steel as bright as glass."
300,8,365,"These will I take as I retire, as shares I firmly save,"
300,8,366,Though Agamemnon be so base to take the gifts he gave.
300,8,367,"Tell him all this, and openly, I on your honours charge,"
300,8,368,"That others may take shame to hear his lusts command so large,"
300,8,369,"And, if there yet remain a man he hopeth to deceive"
300,8,370,(Being dyed in endless impudence) that man may learn to leave
300,8,371,"His trust and empire. But alas, though, like a wolf he be,"
300,8,372,"Shameless and rude, he durst not take my prise, and look on me."
300,8,373,"I never will partake his works, nor counsels, as before,"
300,8,374,"He once deceiv’d and injur’d me, and he shall never more"
300,8,375,Tye my affections with his words. Enough is the increase
300,8,376,"Of one success in his deceits; which let him joy in peace,"
300,8,377,And bear it to a wretched end. Wise Jove hath reft his brain
300,8,378,"To bring him plagues, and these his gifts I, as my foes, disdain."
300,8,379,"Ev’n in the numbness of calm death I will revengeful be,"
300,8,380,"Though ten or twenty times so much he would bestow on me,"
300,8,381,"All he hath here, or any where, or Orchomen contains,"
300,8,382,"To which men bring their wealth for strength, or all the store remains"
300,8,383,"In circuit of Egyptian Thebes, where much hid treasure lies,"
300,8,384,"Whose walls contain an hundred ports, of so admir’d a size"
300,8,385,Two hundred soldiers may a - front with horse and chariots pass.
300,8,386,"Nor, would he amplify all this like sand, or dust, or grass,"
300,8,387,"Should he reclaim me, till this wreak pay’d me for all the pains"
300,8,388,"That with his contumely burn’d, like poison, in my veins."
300,8,389,"Nor shall his daughter be my wife, although she might contend"
300,8,390,"With golden Venus for her form, or if she did transcend"
300,8,391,Blue - ey’d Minerva for her works; let him a Greek select
300,8,392,"Fit for her, and a greater king. For if the Gods protect"
300,8,393,"My safety to my father’s court, he shall choose me a wife."
300,8,394,Many fair Achive princesses of unimpeachéd life
300,8,395,"In Helle and in Phthia live, whose sires do cities hold,"
300,8,396,"Of whom I can have whom I will. And, more an hundred fold"
300,8,397,My true mind in my country likes to take a lawful wife
300,8,398,Than in another nation; and there delight my life
300,8,399,"With those goods that my father got, much rather than die here."
300,8,400,"Not all the wealth of well - built Troy, possess’d when peace was there,"
300,8,401,"All that Apollo’s marble fane in stony Pythos holds,"
300,8,402,I value equal with the life that my free breast enfolds.
300,8,403,"Sheep, oxen, tripods, crest - deck’d horse, though lost, may come again,"
300,8,404,But when the white guard of our teeth no longer can contain
300,8,405,"Our human soul, away it flies, and, once gone, never more"
300,8,406,To her frail mansion any man can her lost pow’rs restore.
300,8,407,"And therefore since my mother - queen, fam’d for her silver feet,"
300,8,408,Told me two fates about my death in my direction meet:
300,8,409,"The one, that, if I here remain t’ assist our victory,"
300,8,410,"My safe return shall never live, my fame shall never die;"
300,8,411,"If my return obtain success, much of my fame decays,"
300,8,412,"But death shall linger his approach, and I live many days,"
300,8,413,"This being reveal’d, ’twere foolish pride, t’ abridge my life for"
300,8,414,praise.
300,8,415,"Then with myself, I will advise, others to hoise their sail,"
300,8,416,"For, ’gainst the height of Ilion, you never shall prevail,"
300,8,417,"Jove with his hand protecteth it, and makes the soldiers bold."
300,8,418,"This tell the kings in ev’ry part, for so grave legates should,"
300,8,419,"That they may better counsels use, to save their fleet and friends"
300,8,420,"By their own valours; since this course, drown’d in my anger, ends."
300,8,421,"Phœnix may in my tent repose, and in the morn steer course"
300,8,422,"For Phthia, if he think it good; if not, I’ll use no force.”"
300,8,423,"All wonder’d at his stern reply; and Phœnix, full of fears"
300,8,424,"His words would be more weak than just, supplied their wants with"
300,8,425,tears.
300,8,426,"“If thy return incline thee thus, Peleus’ renownéd joy,"
300,8,427,"And thou wilt let our ships be burn’d with harmful fire of Troy,"
300,8,428,"Since thou art angry, O my son, how shall I after be"
300,8,429,"Alone in these extremes of death, relinquishéd by thee?"
300,8,430,"I, whom thy royal father sent as ord’rer of thy force,"
300,8,431,"When to Atrides from his court he left thee for this course,"
300,8,432,"Yet young, and when in skill of arms thou didst not so abound,"
300,8,433,"Nor hadst the habit of discourse, that makes men so renown’d."
300,8,434,"In all which I was set by him, t’ instruct thee as my son,"
300,8,435,"That thou might’st speak, when speech was fit, and do, when deeds were"
300,8,436,"done,"
300,8,437,"Not sit as dumb, for want of words, idle, for skill to move,"
300,8,438,"I would not then be left by thee, dear son, begot in love,"
300,8,439,"No, not if God would promise me, to raze the prints of time"
300,8,440,"Carv’d in my bosom and my brows, and grace me with the prime"
300,8,441,"Of manly youth, as when at first I left sweet Helle’s shore"
300,8,442,"Deck’d with fair dames, and fled the grudge my angry father bore;"
300,8,443,"Who was the fair Amyntor call’d, surnam’d Ormenides,"
300,8,444,"And for a fair - hair’d harlot’s sake, that his affects could please,"
300,8,445,"Contemn’d my mother, his true wife, who ceaseless urgéd me"
300,8,446,"To use his harlot Clytia, and still would clasp my knee"
300,8,447,"To do her will, that so my sire might turn his love to hate"
300,8,448,"Of that lewd dame, converting it to comfort her estate."
300,8,449,"At last I was content to prove to do my mother good,"
300,8,450,"And reconcile my father’s love; who straight suspicious stood,"
300,8,451,"Pursuing me with many a curse, and to the Furies pray’d"
300,8,452,"No dame might love, nor bring me seed. The Deities obey’d"
300,8,453,"That govern hell; infernal Jove, and stern Persephone."
300,8,454,Then durst I in no longer date with my stern father be.
300,8,455,"Yet did my friends, and near allies, inclose me with desires"
300,8,456,"Not to depart; kill’d sheep, boars, beeves; roast them at solemn fires;"
300,8,457,And from my father’s tuns we drunk exceeding store of wine.
300,8,458,"Nine nights they guarded me by turns, their fires did ceaseless shine,"
300,8,459,"One in the porch of his strong hall, and in the portal one,"
300,8,460,"Before my chamber; but when day beneath the tenth night shone,"
300,8,461,"I brake my chamber’s thick - fram’d doors, and through the hall’s guard"
300,8,462,"pass’d,"
300,8,463,"Unseen of any man or maid. Through Greece then, rich and vast,"
300,8,464,"I fled to Phthia, nurse of sheep, and came to Peleus’ court;"
300,8,465,"Who entertain’d me heartily, and in as gracious sort"
300,8,466,"As any sire his only son, born when his strength is spent,"
300,8,467,And bless’d with great possessions to leave to his descent.
300,8,468,"He made me rich, and to my charge did much command commend."
300,8,469,"I dwelt in th’ utmost region rich Phthia doth extend,"
300,8,470,"And govern’d the Dolopians, and made thee what thou art,"
300,8,471,"O thou that like the Gods art fram’d. Since, dearest to my heart,"
300,8,472,"I us’d thee so, thou lov’dst none else; nor anywhere wouldst eat,"
300,8,473,"Till I had crown’d my knee with thee, and carv’d thee tend’rest meat,"
300,8,474,"And giv’n thee wine so much, for love, that, in thy infancy"
300,8,475,"(Which still discretion must protect, and a continual eye)"
300,8,476,My bosom lovingly sustain’d the wine thine could not bear.
300,8,477,"Then, now my strength needs thine as much, be mine to thee as dear,"
300,8,478,"Much have I suffer’d for thy love, much labour’d, wishéd much,"
300,8,479,"Thinking, since I must have no heir (the Gods’ decrees are such)"
300,8,480,I would adopt thyself my heir. To thee my heart did give
300,8,481,What any sire could give his son. In thee I hop’d to live.
300,8,482,O mitigate thy mighty spirits. It fits not one that moves
300,8,483,"The hearts of all, to live unmov’d, and succour hates for loves."
300,8,484,"The Gods themselves are flexible; whose virtues, honours, pow’rs,"
300,8,485,"Are more than thine, yet they will bend their breasts as we bend ours."
300,8,486,"Perfumes, benign devotions, savours of off’rings burn’d,"
300,8,487,"And holy rites, the engines are with which their hearts are turn’d,"
300,8,488,"By men that pray to them, whose faith their sins have falsified."
300,8,489,"For Pray’rs are daughters of great Jove, lame, wrinkled, ruddy - ey’d,"
300,8,490,"And ever following injury, who, strong and sound of feet,"
300,8,491,"Flies through the world, afflicting men. Believing Prayers yet,"
300,8,492,"To all that love that Seed of Jove, the certain blessing get"
300,8,493,"To have Jove hear, and help them too; but if he shall refuse,"
300,8,494,"And stand inflexible to them, they fly to Jove, and use"
300,8,495,"Their pow’rs against him, that the wrongs he doth to them may fall"
300,8,496,"On his own head, and pay those pains whose cure he fails to call."
300,8,497,"Then, great Achilles, honour thou this sacred Seed of Jove,"
300,8,498,"And yield to them, since other men of greatest minds they move."
300,8,499,"If Agamemnon would not give the self - same gifts he vows,"
300,8,500,"But offer other afterwards, and in his still - bent brows"
300,8,501,"Entomb his honour and his word, I would not thus exhort,"
300,8,502,"With wrath appeas’d, thy aid to Greece, though plagu’d in heaviest"
300,8,503,sort;
300,8,504,"But much he presently will give, and after yield the rest."
300,8,505,"T’ assure which he hath sent to thee the men thou lovest best,"
300,8,506,"And most renown’d of all the host, that they might soften thee."
300,8,507,"Then let not both their pains and pray’rs lost and despiséd be,"
300,8,508,"Before which none could reprehend the tumult of thy heart,"
300,8,509,But now to rest inexpiate were much too rude a part.
300,8,510,"Of ancient worthies we have heard, when they were more displeas’d,"
300,8,511,"To their high fames, with gifts and pray’rs they have been still"
300,8,512,appeas’d.
300,8,513,"For instance, I remember well a fact perform’d of old,"
300,8,514,"Which to you all, my friends, I’ll tell: The Curets wars did hold"
300,8,515,"With the well - fought Ætolians, where mutual lives had end"
300,8,516,About the city Calydon. Th’ Ætolians did defend
300,8,517,"Their flourishing country, which to spoil the Curets did contend."
300,8,518,"Diana with - the - golden - throne, with Oeneus much incens’d,"
300,8,519,"Since with his plenteous land’s first fruits she was not reverenc’d,"
300,8,520,"(Yet other Gods, with hecatombs, had feasts, and she alone,"
300,8,521,"Great Jove’s bright daughter, left unserv’d, or by oblivion,"
300,8,522,Or undue knowledge of her dues) much hurt in heart she swore;
300,8,523,"And she, enrag’d, excited much, she sent a sylvan boar"
300,8,524,"From their green groves, with wounding tusks; who usually did spoil"
300,8,525,"King Oeneus’ fields, his lofty woods laid prostrate on the soil,"
300,8,526,"Rent by the roots trees fresh, adorn’d with fragrant apple flow’rs."
300,8,527,"Which Meleager (Oeneus’ son) slew, with assembl’d pow’rs"
300,8,528,"Of hunters, and of fiercest hounds, from many cities brought;"
300,8,529,"For such he was that with few lives his death could not be bought,"
300,8,530,"Heaps of dead humans, by his rage, the fun’ral piles applied."
300,8,531,"Yet, slain at last, the Goddess stirr’d about his head, and hide,"
300,8,532,"A wondrous tumult, and a war betwixt the Curets wrought"
300,8,533,"And brave Ætolians. All the while fierce Meleager fought,"
300,8,534,"Ill - far’d the Curets; near the walls none durst advance his crest,"
300,8,535,Though they were many. But when wrath inflam’d his haughty breast
300,8,536,(Which oft the firm mind of the wise with passion doth infest)
300,8,537,"Since ’twixt his mother - queen and him arose a deadly strife,"
300,8,538,"He left the court, and privately liv’d with his lawful wife,"
300,8,539,"Fair Cleopatra, female birth of bright Marpessa’s pain,"
300,8,540,"And of Ideus; who of all terrestrial men did reign,"
300,8,541,"At that time, king of fortitude, and for Marpessa’s sake,"
300,8,542,"‘Gainst wanton Phœbus, king of flames; his bow in hand did take,"
300,8,543,"Since he had ravish’d her, his joy; whom her friends after gave"
300,8,544,"The surname of Alcyone, because they could not save"
300,8,545,Their daughter from Alcyone’s fate. In Cleopatra’s arms
300,8,546,"Lay Meleager, feeding on his anger, for the harms"
300,8,547,"His mother pray’d might fall on him; who, for her brother slain"
300,8,548,"By Meleager, griev’d, and pray’d the Gods to wreak her pain"
300,8,549,With all the horror could be pour’d upon her furious birth.
300,8,550,"Still knock’d she with her impious hands the many - feeding earth,"
300,8,551,"To urge stern Pluto and his Queen t’ incline their vengeful ears,"
300,8,552,"Fell on her knees, and all her breast dew’d with her fi’ry tears,"
300,8,553,"To make them massacre her son, whose wrath enrag’d her thus."
300,8,554,"Erinnys, wand’ring through the air, heard, out of Erebus,"
300,8,555,Pray’rs fit for her unpleaséd mind. Yet Meleager lay
300,8,556,Obscur’d in fury. Then the bruit of the tumultuous fray
300,8,557,Rung through the turrets as they scal’d; then came th’ Ætolian peers
300,8,558,"To Meleager with low suits, to rise and free their fears;"
300,8,559,"Then sent they the chief priests of Gods, with offer’d gifts t’ atone"
300,8,560,"His diff’ring fury, bade him choose, in sweet - soil’d Calydon,"
300,8,561,"Of the most fat and yieldy soil, what with an hundred steers"
300,8,562,"Might in a hundred days be plough’d, half that rich vintage bears,"
300,8,563,And half of naked earth to plough; yet yielded not his ire.
300,8,564,"Then to his lofty chamber - door, ascends his royal sire"
300,8,565,"With ruthful plaints, shook the strong bars; then came his sisters’"
300,8,566,cries;
300,8,567,His mother then; and all intreat; — yet still more stiff he lies; —
300,8,568,"His friends, most rev’rend, most esteem’d; yet none impression took,"
300,8,569,"Till the high turrets where he lay, and his strong chamber, shook"
300,8,570,"With the invading enemy, who now forced dreadful way"
300,8,571,"Along the city. Then his wife, in pitifil dismay,"
300,8,572,"Besought him, weeping; telling him the miseries sustain’d"
300,8,573,"By all the citizens, whose town the enemy had gain’d;"
300,8,574,Men slaughter’d; children bondslaves made; sweet ladies forc’d with
300,8,575,lust;
300,8,576,"Fires climbing tow’rs, and turning them to heaps of fruitless dust."
300,8,577,"These dangers soften’d his steel heart. Up the stout prince arose,"
300,8,578,"Indu’d his body with rich arms, and freed th’ Ætolian’s woes,"
300,8,579,"His smother’d anger giving air; which gifts did not assuage,"
300,8,580,But his own peril. And because he did not disengage
300,8,581,"Their lives for gifts, their gifts he lost. But for my sake, dear"
300,8,582,"friend,"
300,8,583,"Be not thou bent to see our plights to these extremes descend,"
300,8,584,Ere thou assist us; be not so by thy ill angel turn’d
300,8,585,"From thine own honour. It were shame to see our navy burn’d,"
300,8,586,"And then come with thy timeless aid. For offer’d presents, come,"
300,8,587,"And all the Greeks will honour thee, as of celestial room."
300,8,588,"But if without these gifts thou fight, forc’d by thy private woe,"
300,8,589,"Thou wilt be nothing so renown’d, though thou repel the foe.”"
300,8,590,Achilles answer’d the last part of this oration thus:
300,8,591,"“Phœnix, renown’d and reverend, the honours urg’d on us"
300,8,592,"We need not, Jove doth honour me, and to my safety sees,"
300,8,593,"And will, whiles I retain a spirit, or can command my knees."
300,8,594,"Then do not thou with tears and woes impassion my affects,"
300,8,595,Becoming gracious to my foe. Nor fits it the respects
300,8,596,"Of thy vow’d love to honour him that hath dishonour’d me,"
300,8,597,Lest such loose kindness lose his heart that yet is firm to thee.
300,8,598,"It were thy praise to hurt with me the hurter of my state,"
300,8,599,Since half my honour and my realm thou mayst participate.
300,8,600,"Let these lords then return th’ event, and do thou here repose,"
300,8,601,"And, when dark sleep breaks with the day, our counsels shall disclose"
300,8,602,"The course of our return or stay.” This said, he with his eye"
300,8,603,"Made to his friend a covert sign, to hasten instantly"
300,8,604,"A good soft bed, that the old prince, soon as the peers were gone,"
300,8,605,"Might take his rest; when, soldier - like, brave Ajax Telamon"
300,8,606,"Spake to Ulysses, as with thought Achilles was not worth"
300,8,607,"The high direction of his speech, that stood so sternly forth"
300,8,608,"Unmov’d with th’ other orators, and spake, not to appease"
300,8,609,"Pelides’ wrath, but to depart. His arguments were these:"
300,8,610,"“High - issu’d Laertiades, let us insist no more"
300,8,611,On his persuasion. I perceive the world would end before
300,8,612,Our speeches end in this affair. We must with utmost haste
300,8,613,"Return his answer, though but bad. The peers are elsewhere plac’d,"
300,8,614,And will not rise till we return. Great Thetis’ son hath stor’d
300,8,615,"Proud wrath within him, as his wealth, and will not be implor’d,"
300,8,616,"Rude that he is, nor his friends’ love respects, do what they can,"
300,8,617,"Wherein past all, we honour’d him. O unremorseful man!"
300,8,618,"Another for his brother slain, another for his son,"
300,8,619,Accepts of satisfaction; and he the deed hath done
300,8,620,"Lives in belov’d society long after his amends,"
300,8,621,"To which his foe’s high heart, for gifts, with patience condescends;"
300,8,622,"But thee a wild and cruel spirit the Gods for plague have giv’n,"
300,8,623,"And for one girl, of whose fair sex we come to offer sev’n,"
300,8,624,"The most exempt for excellence, and many a better prise."
300,8,625,"Then put a sweet mind in thy breast, respect thy own allies,"
300,8,626,"Though others make thee not remiss. A multitude we are,"
300,8,627,"Sprung of thy royal family, and our supremest care"
300,8,628,"Is to be most familiar, and hold most love with thee"
300,8,629,"Of all the Greeks, how great an host soever here there be.”"
300,8,630,"He answer’d: “Noble Telamon, prince of our soldiers here,"
300,8,631,"Out of thy heart I know thou speak’st, and as thou hold’st me dear;"
300,8,632,"But still as often as I think, how rudely I was us’d,"
300,8,633,"And, like a stranger, for all rites, fit for our good, refus’d"
300,8,634,"My heart doth swell against the man, that durst be so profane"
300,8,635,"To violate his sacred place; not for my private bane,"
300,8,636,But since wrack’d virtue’s gen’ral laws he shameless did infringe;
300,8,637,"For whose sake I will loose the reins, and give mine anger swinge,"
300,8,638,"Without my wisdom’s least impeach. He is a fool, and base,"
300,8,639,"That pities vice - plagu’d minds, when pain, not love of right, gives"
300,8,640,place.
300,8,641,"And therefore tell your king, my lords, my just wrath will not care"
300,8,642,"For all his cares, before my tents and navy chargéd are"
300,8,643,"By warlike Hector, making way through flocks of Grecian lives,"
300,8,644,Enlighten’d by their naval fire; but when his rage arrives
300,8,645,"About my tent, and sable bark, I doubt not but to shield"
300,8,646,"Them and myself, and make him fly the there strong - bounded field.”"
300,8,647,"This said, each one but kiss’d the cup, and to the ships retir’d;"
300,8,648,Ulysses first. Patroclus then the men and maids requir’d
300,8,649,"To make grave Phœnix’ bed with speed, and see he nothing lacks."
300,8,650,"They straight obey’d, and thereon laid the subtile fruit of flax,"
300,8,651,"And warm sheep - fells for covering; and there the old man slept,"
300,8,652,Attending till the golden Morn her usual station kept.
300,8,653,"Achilles lay in th’ inner room of his tent richly wrought,"
300,8,654,"And that fair lady by his side, that he from Lesbos brought,"
300,8,655,"Bright Diomeda, Phorbas’ seed. Patroclus did embrace"
300,8,656,"The beauteous Iphis, giv’n to him, when his bold friend did race"
300,8,657,The lofty Scyrus that was kept in Enyeius’ hold.
300,8,658,"Now at the tent of Atreus’ son, each man with cups of gold"
300,8,659,Receiv’d th’ ambassadors return’d. All cluster’d near to know
300,8,660,What news they brought; which first the king would have Ulysses show:
300,8,661,"“Say, most praiseworthy Ithacus, the Grecians’ great renown,"
300,8,662,Will he defend us? Or not yet will his proud stomach down?”
300,8,663,"Ulysses made reply: “Not yet will he appeaséd be,"
300,8,664,"But grows more wrathful, prizing light thy offer’d gifts and thee,"
300,8,665,"And wills thee to consult with us, and take some other course"
300,8,666,"To save our army and our fleet, and says, ‘with all his force,"
300,8,667,"The morn shall light him on his way to Phthia’s wishéd soil,"
300,8,668,"For never shall high - seated Troy be sack’d with all our toil,"
300,8,669,"Jove holds his hand ’twixt us and it, the soldiers gather heart.’"
300,8,670,"Thus he replies, which Ajax here can equally impart,"
300,8,671,"And both these heralds. Phœnix stays, for so was his desire,"
300,8,672,"To go with him, if he thought good; if not, he might retire.”"
300,8,673,All wonder’d he should be so stern; at last bold Diomed spake:
300,8,674,"“Would God, Atrides, thy request were yet to undertake,"
300,8,675,"And all thy gifts unoffer’d him! He’s proud enough beside,"
300,8,676,But this ambassage thou hast sent will make him burst with pride.
300,8,677,"But let us suffer him to stay, or go, at his desire,"
300,8,678,"Fight when his stomach serves him best, or when Jove shall inspire."
300,8,679,"Meanwhile, our watch being strongly held, let us a little rest"
300,8,680,"After our food; strength lives by both, and virtue is their guest."
300,8,681,"Then when the rosy - finger’d Morn holds out her silver light,"
300,8,682,"Bring forth thy host, encourage all, and be thou first in fight.”"
300,8,683,"The kings admir’d the fortitude, that so divinely mov’d"
300,8,684,"The skilful horseman Diomed, and his advice approv’d."
300,8,685,"Then with their nightly sacrifice each took his sev’ral tent,"
300,8,686,Where all receiv’d the sov’reign gifts soft Somnus did present.
300,8,687,THE END OF THE NINTH BOOK.
300,8,688,[1] Diomed takes fit time to answer his wrong done by Agamemnon in the
300,8,689,fourth book.
300,9,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,9,2,"Th’ Atrides, watching, wake the other peers,"
300,9,3,"And (in the fort, consulting of their fears)"
300,9,4,"Two kings they send, most stout, and honour’d most,"
300,9,5,"For royal scouts, into the Trojan host;"
300,9,6,"Who meeting Dolon, Hector’s bribed spy,"
300,9,7,"Take him, and learn how all the quarters lie."
300,9,8,"He told them, in the Thracian regiment"
300,9,9,"Of rich king Rhesus, and his royal tent,"
300,9,10,"Striving for safety; but they end his strife,"
300,9,11,"And rid poor Dolon of a dang’rous life,"
300,9,12,Then with digressive wiles they use their force
300,9,13,"On Rhesus’ life, and take his snowy horse."
300,9,14,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,9,15,Kappa the night exploits applies:
300,9,16,Rhesus’ and Dolons tragedies.
300,9,17,"The other princes at their ships soft - finger’d sleep did bind,"
300,9,18,But not the Gen’ral; Somnus’ silks bound not his labouring mind
300,9,19,"That turn’d, and return’d, many thoughts. And as quick lightnings"
300,9,20,"fly,[1]"
300,9,21,"From well - deck’d Juno’s sovereign, out of the thicken’d sky,"
300,9,22,"Preparing some exceeding rain, or hail, the fruit of cold,"
300,9,23,"Or down - like snow that suddenly makes all the fields look old,"
300,9,24,"Or opes the gulfy mouth of war with his ensulphur’d hand,"
300,9,25,"In dazzling flashes pour’d from clouds, on any punish’d land;"
300,9,26,"So from Atrides’ troubled heart, through his dark sorrows, flew"
300,9,27,"Redoubled sighs; his entrails shook, as often as his view"
300,9,28,"Admir’d the multitude of fires, that gilt the Phrygian shade,"
300,9,29,"And heard the sounds of fifes, and shawms, and tumults soldiers made."
300,9,30,"But when he saw his fleet and host kneel to his care and love,"
300,9,31,"He rent his hair up by the roots as sacrifice to Jove,"
300,9,32,"Burnt in his fi’ry sighs, still breath’d out of his royal heart,"
300,9,33,"And first thought good to Nestor’s care his sorrows to impart,"
300,9,34,"To try if royal diligence, with his approv’d advice,"
300,9,35,Might fashion counsels to prevent their threaten’d miseries.
300,9,36,"So up he rose, attir’d himself, and to his strong feet tied"
300,9,37,"Rich shoes, and cast upon his back a ruddy lion’s hide,"
300,9,38,"So ample it his ankles reach’d, then took his royal spear."
300,9,39,"Like him was Menelaus pierc’d with an industrious fear,"
300,9,40,"Nor sat sweet slumber on his eyes, lest bitter fates should quite"
300,9,41,"The Greeks’ high favours, that for him resolv’d such endless fight."
300,9,42,And first a freckled panther’s hide hid his broad back athwart;
300,9,43,His head his brazen helm did arm; his able hand his dart;
300,9,44,"Then made he all his haste to raise his brother’s head as rare,"
300,9,45,That he who most excell’d in rule might help t’ effect his care.
300,9,46,"He found him, at his ship’s crook’d stern, adorning him with arms;"
300,9,47,"Who joy’d to see his brother’s spirits awak’d without alarms,"
300,9,48,Well weighing th’ importance of the time. And first the younger spake:
300,9,49,"“Why, brother, are ye arming thus? Is it to undertake"
300,9,50,"The sending of some vent’rous Greek, t’ explore the foe’s intent?"
300,9,51,"Alas! I greatly fear, not one will give that work consent,"
300,9,52,Expos’d alone to all the fears that flow in gloomy night.
300,9,53,"He that doth this must know death well, in which ends ev’ry fright.”"
300,9,54,"“Brother,” said he, “in these affairs we both must use advice,"
300,9,55,"Jove is against us, and accepts great Hector’s sacrifice."
300,9,56,"For I have never seen, nor heard, in one day, and by one,"
300,9,57,"So many high attempts well urg’d, as Hector’s pow’r hath done"
300,9,58,"Against the hapless sons of Greece: being chiefly dear to Jove,"
300,9,59,"And without cause, being neither fruit of any Goddess’ love,"
300,9,60,"Nor helpful God; and yet I fear the deepness of his hand,"
300,9,61,"Ere it be ras’d out of our thoughts, will many years withstand."
300,9,62,"But, brother, hie thee to thy ships, and Idomen’s disease"
300,9,63,"With warlike Ajax; I will haste to grave Neleides,"
300,9,64,"Exhorting him to rise, and give the sacred watch command,"
300,9,65,"For they will specially embrace incitement at his hand,"
300,9,66,"And now his son their captain is, and Idomen’s good friend,"
300,9,67,"Bold Merion, to whose discharge we did that charge commend.”"
300,9,68,"“Command’st thou then,” his brother ask’d, “that I shall tarry here"
300,9,69,"Attending thy resolv’d approach, or else the message bear,"
300,9,70,"And quickly make return to thee?” He answer’d: “Rather stay,"
300,9,71,"Lest otherwise we fail to meet, for many a diff’rent way"
300,9,72,"Lies through our labyrinthian host. Speak ever as you go,"
300,9,73,"Command strong watch, from sire to son urge all t’ observe the foe,"
300,9,74,"Familiarly, and with their praise, exciting ev’ry eye,"
300,9,75,Not with unseason’d violence of proud authority.
300,9,76,"We must our patience exercise, and work ourselves with them,"
300,9,77,Jove in our births combin’d such care to either’s diadem.”
300,9,78,"Thus he dismiss’d him, knowing well his charge before he went."
300,9,79,"Himself to Nestor, whom he found in bed within his tent,"
300,9,80,"By him his damask curets hung, his shield, a pair of darts,"
300,9,81,"His shining casque, his arming waist; in these he led the hearts"
300,9,82,"Of his apt soldiers to sharp war, not yielding to his years."
300,9,83,"He quickly started from his bed, when to his watchful ears"
300,9,84,"Untimely feet told some approach; he took his lance in hand,"
300,9,85,"And spake to him: “Ho, what art thou that walk’st at midnight? Stand."
300,9,86,Is any wanting at the guards? Or lack’st thou any peer?
300,9,87,"Speak, come not silent towards me; say, what intend’st thou here?”"
300,9,88,"He answer’d: “O Neleides, grave honour of our host,"
300,9,89,"’Tis Agamemnon thou mayst know, whom Jove afflicteth most"
300,9,90,"Of all the wretched men that live, and will, whilst any breath"
300,9,91,"Gives motion to my toiled limbs, and bears me up from death."
300,9,92,"I walk the round thus, since sweet sleep cannot inclose mine eyes,"
300,9,93,Nor shut those organs care breaks ope for our calamities.
300,9,94,"My fear is vehement for the Greeks; my heart, the fount of heat,"
300,9,95,"With his extreme affects made cold, without my breast doth beat;"
300,9,96,And therefore are my sinews strook with trembling; ev’ry part
300,9,97,Of what my friends may feel hath act in my disperséd heart.
300,9,98,"But, if thou think’st of any course may to our good redound,"
300,9,99,"(Since neither thou thyself canst sleep) come, walk with me the round;"
300,9,100,"In way whereof we may confer, and look to ev’ry guard,"
300,9,101,"Lest watching long, and weariness with labouring so hard,"
300,9,102,Drown their oppresséd memories of what they have in charge.
300,9,103,"The liberty we give the foe, alas, is over large,"
300,9,104,"Their camp is almost mix’d with ours, and we have forth no spies"
300,9,105,To learn their drifts; who may perchance this night intend surprise.”
300,9,106,"Grave Nestor answer’d: “Worthy king, let good hearts bear our ill."
300,9,107,Jove is not bound to perfect all this busy Hector’s will;
300,9,108,"But I am confidently giv’n, his thoughts are much dismay’d"
300,9,109,"With fear, lest our distress incite Achilles to our aid,"
300,9,110,"And therefore will not tempt his fate, nor ours, with further pride."
300,9,111,"But I will gladly follow thee, and stir up more beside;"
300,9,112,"Tydides, famous for his lance; Ulysses; Telamon;"
300,9,113,"And bold Phylëus’ valiant heir. Or else, if anyone"
300,9,114,"Would haste to call king Idomen, and Ajax, since their sail"
300,9,115,"Lie so remov’d, with much good speed, it might our haste avail."
300,9,116,"But, though he be our honour’d friend, thy brother I will blame,"
300,9,117,Not fearing if I anger thee. It is his utter shame
300,9,118,"He should commit all pains to thee, that should himself employ,"
300,9,119,"Past all our princes, in the care, and cure, of our annoy,"
300,9,120,"And be so far from needing spurs to these his due respects,"
300,9,121,"He should apply our spirits himself, with pray’rs and urg’d affects."
300,9,122,"Necessity (a law to laws, and not to be endur’d)"
300,9,123,"Makes proof of all his faculties, not sound if not inur’d.”"
300,9,124,"“Good father,” said the king, “sometimes you know I have desir’d"
300,9,125,"You would improve his negligence, too oft to ease retir’d."
300,9,126,"Nor is it for defect of spirit, or compass of his brain,"
300,9,127,"But with observing my estate, he thinks, he should abstain"
300,9,128,"Till I commanded, knowing my place; unwilling to assume,"
300,9,129,"For being my brother, anything might prove he did presume."
300,9,130,"But now he rose before me far, and came t’ avoid delays,"
300,9,131,And I have sent him for the men yourself desir’d to raise.
300,9,132,"Come, we shall find them at the guards we plac’d before the fort,"
300,9,133,For thither my direction was they should with speed resort.”
300,9,134,"“Why now,” said Nestor, “none will grudge, nor his just rule withstand."
300,9,135,"Examples make excitements strong, and sweeten a command.”"
300,9,136,"Thus put he on his arming truss, fair shoes upon his feet,"
300,9,137,"About him a mandilion, that did with buttons meet,"
300,9,138,"Of purple, large, and full of folds, curl’d with a warmful nap,"
300,9,139,A garment that ’gainst cold in nights did soldiers use to wrap;
300,9,140,"Then took he his strong lance in hand, made sharp with proved steel,"
300,9,141,And went along the Grecian fleet. First at Ulysses’ keel
300,9,142,"He call’d, to break the silken fumes that did his senses bind."
300,9,143,The voice through th’ organs of his ears straight rung about his mind.
300,9,144,"Forth came Ulysses, asking him: “Why stir ye thus so late?"
300,9,145,"Sustain we such enforcive cause?” He answered, “Our estate"
300,9,146,"Doth force this perturbation; vouchsafe it, worthy friend,"
300,9,147,"And come, let us excite one more, to counsel of some end"
300,9,148,"To our extremes, by fight, or flight.” He back, and took his shield,"
300,9,149,"And both took course to Diomed. They found him laid in field,"
300,9,150,Far from his tent; his armour by; about him was dispread
300,9,151,"A ring of soldiers, ev’ry man his shield beneath his head;"
300,9,152,"His spear fix’d by him as he slept, the great end in the ground,"
300,9,153,"The point, that bristled the dark earth, cast a reflection round"
300,9,154,"Like palid lightnings thrown from Jove; thus this heroë lay,"
300,9,155,And under him a big ox - hide; his royal head had stay
300,9,156,"On arras hangings, rolléd up; whereon he slept so fast,"
300,9,157,"That Nestor stirr’d him with his foot, and chid to see him cast"
300,9,158,"In such deep sleep in such deep woes, and ask’d him why he spent"
300,9,159,"All night in sleep, or did not hear the Trojans near his tent,"
300,9,160,"Their camp drawn close upon their dike, small space ’twixt foes and"
300,9,161,foes?
300,9,162,"He, starting up, said, “Strange old man, that never tak’st repose,"
300,9,163,"Thou art too patient of our toil. Have we not men more young,"
300,9,164,To be employ’d from king to king? Thine age hath too much wrong.”
300,9,165,"“Said like a king,” replied the sire, “for I have sons renown’d,"
300,9,166,"And there are many other men, might go this toilsome round;"
300,9,167,"But, you must see, imperious Need hath all at her command."
300,9,168,"Now on the eager razor’s edge, for life or death, we stand[2]"
300,9,169,"Then go (thou art the younger man) and if thou love my ease,"
300,9,170,"Call swift - foot Ajax up thyself, and young Phyleides.”"
300,9,171,"This said, he on his shoulders cast a yellow lion’s hide,"
300,9,172,"Big, and reach’d earth; then took his spear, and Nestor’s will applied,"
300,9,173,"Rais’d the heroes, brought them both. All met; the round they went,"
300,9,174,"And found not any captain there asleep or negligent,"
300,9,175,"But waking, and in arms, gave ear to ev’ry lowest sound."
300,9,176,"And as keen dogs keep sheep in cotes, or folds of hurdles bound,"
300,9,177,"And grin at ev’ry breach of air, envious of all that moves,"
300,9,178,Still list’ning when the rav’nous beast stalks through the hilly
300,9,179,"groves,"
300,9,180,"Then men and dogs stand on their guards, and mighty tumults make,"
300,9,181,"Sleep wanting weight to close one wink; so did the captains wake,"
300,9,182,"That kept the watch the whole sad night, all with intentive ear"
300,9,183,"Converted to the enemies’ tents, that they might timely hear"
300,9,184,If they were stirring to surprise; which Nestor joy’d to see.
300,9,185,"“Why so, dear sons, maintain your watch, sleep not a wink,” said he,"
300,9,186,“Rather than make your fames the scorn of Trojan perjury.”
300,9,187,"This said, he foremost passed the dike, the others seconded,"
300,9,188,"Ev’n all the kings that had been call’d to council from the bed,"
300,9,189,"And with them went Meriones, and Nestor’s famous son;"
300,9,190,For both were call’d by all the kings to consultation.
300,9,191,"Beyond the dike they choos’d a place, near as they could from blood,"
300,9,192,"Where yet appear’d the falls of some, and whence, the crimson flood"
300,9,193,"Of Grecian lives being pour’d on earth by Hector’s furious chace,"
300,9,194,"He made retreat, when night repour’d grim darkness in his face."
300,9,195,"There sat they down, and Nestor spake: “O friends, remains not one"
300,9,196,"That will rely on his bold mind, and view the camp, alone,"
300,9,197,"Of the proud Trojans, to approve if any straggling mate"
300,9,198,"He can surprise near th’ utmost tents, or learn the brief estate"
300,9,199,"Of their intentions for the time, and mix like one of them"
300,9,200,"With their outguards, expiscating if the renown’d extreme"
300,9,201,"They force on us will serve their turns, with glory to retire,"
300,9,202,"Or still encamp thus far from Troy? This may he well inquire,"
300,9,203,And make a brave retreat untouch’d; and this would win him fame
300,9,204,"Of all men canopied with heav’n, and ev’ry man of name,"
300,9,205,"In all this host shall honour him with an enriching meed,"
300,9,206,A black ewe and her sucking lamb (rewards that now exceed
300,9,207,"All other best possessions, in all men’s choice requests)"
300,9,208,And still be bidden by our kings to kind and royal feasts.”
300,9,209,"All rev’renc’d one another’s worth; and none would silence break,"
300,9,210,Lest worst should take best place of speech; at last did Diomed speak:
300,9,211,"“Nestor, thou ask’st if no man here have heart so well inclin’d"
300,9,212,"To work this stratagem on Troy? Yes, I have such a mind."
300,9,213,"Yet, if some other prince would join, more probable will be"
300,9,214,The strengthen’d hope of our exploit. Two may together see
300,9,215,(One going before another still) sly danger ev’ry way;
300,9,216,"One spirit upon another works, and takes with firmer stay"
300,9,217,"The benefit of all his pow’rs; for though one knew his course,"
300,9,218,"Yet might he well distrust himself, which the other might enforce.”"
300,9,219,"This offer ev’ry man assum’d, all would with Diomed go;"
300,9,220,"The two Ajaces, Merion, and Menelaus too;"
300,9,221,"But Nestor’s son enforc’d it much; and hardy Ithacus,"
300,9,222,Who had to ev’ry vent’rous deed a mind as venturous.
300,9,223,"Amongst all these thus spake the king: “Tydides, most belov’d,"
300,9,224,Choose thy associate worthily; a man the most approv’d
300,9,225,For use and strength in these extremes. Many thou seest stand forth;
300,9,226,"But choose not thou by height of place, but by regard of worth,"
300,9,227,"Lest with thy nice respect of right to any man’s degree,"
300,9,228,"Thou wrong’st thy venture, choosing one least fit to join with thee,"
300,9,229,Although perhaps a greater king.” This spake he with suspect
300,9,230,"That Diomed, for honour’s sake, his brother would select."
300,9,231,"Then said Tydides: “Since thou giv’st my judgment leave to choose,"
300,9,232,"How can it so much truth forget Ulysses to refuse,"
300,9,233,"That bears a mind so most exempt, and vig’rous in th’ effect"
300,9,234,"Of all high labours, and a man Pallas doth most respect?"
300,9,235,"We shall return through burning fire, if I with him combine,"
300,9,236,"He sets strength in so true a course, with counsels so divine.”"
300,9,237,"Ulysses, loth to be esteem’d a lover of his praise,"
300,9,238,"With such exceptions humbled him as did him higher raise,"
300,9,239,"And said: “Tydides, praise me not more than free truth will bear,"
300,9,240,Nor yet impair me; they are Greeks that give judicial ear.
300,9,241,"But come, the morning hastes, the stars are forward in their course,"
300,9,242,"Two parts of night are past, the third is left t’ employ our force.”"
300,9,243,Now borrow’d they for haste some arms. Bold Thrasymedes lent
300,9,244,"Advent’rous Diomed his sword (his own was at his tent),"
300,9,245,"His shield, and helm tough and well - tann’d, without or plume or crest,"
300,9,246,"And call’d a murrion, archers’ heads it uséd to invest."
300,9,247,"Meriones lent Ithacus his quiver and his bow,"
300,9,248,His helmet fashion’d of a hide; the workman did bestow
300,9,249,"Much labour in it, quilting it with bow - strings, and, without"
300,9,250,With snowy tusks of white - mouth’d boars ’twas arméd round about
300,9,251,"Right cunningly, and in the midst an arming cap was plac’d,"
300,9,252,That with the fix’d ends of the tusks his head might not be ras’d.
300,9,253,"This, long since, by Autolycus was brought from Eleon,"
300,9,254,"When he laid waste Amyntor’s house, that was Ormenus’ son:"
300,9,255,"In Scandia, to Cytherius, surnam’d Amphidamas,"
300,9,256,"Autolycus did give this helm; he, when he feasted was"
300,9,257,"By honour’d Molus, gave it him, as present of a guest;"
300,9,258,Molus to his son Merion did make it his bequest.
300,9,259,"With this Ulysses arm’d his head; and thus they, both address’d,"
300,9,260,"Took leave of all the other kings. To them a glad ostent,"
300,9,261,"As they were ent’ring on their way, Minerva did present,"
300,9,262,"A hernshaw consecrate to her, which they could ill discern"
300,9,263,"Through sable night, but, by her clange, they knew it was a hern."
300,9,264,"Ulysses joy’d, and thus invok’d: “Hear me, great Seed of Jove,"
300,9,265,"That ever dost my labours grace with presence of thy love,"
300,9,266,"And all my motions dost attend! Still love me, sacred Dame,"
300,9,267,"Especially in this exploit, and so protect our fame"
300,9,268,"We both may safely make retreat, and thriftily employ"
300,9,269,Our boldness in some great affair baneful to them of Troy.”
300,9,270,"Then pray’d illustrate Diomed: “Vouchsafe me likewise ear,"
300,9,271,"O thou unconquer’d Queen of arms! Be with thy favours near,"
300,9,272,"As, to my royal father’s steps, thou went’st a bounteous guide,"
300,9,273,"When th’ Achives and the peers of Thebes he would have pacified,"
300,9,274,"Sent as the Greeks’ ambassador, and left them at the flood"
300,9,275,Of great Æsopus; whose retreat thou mad’st to swim in blood
300,9,276,"Of his enambush’d enemies; and, if thou so protect"
300,9,277,"My bold endeavours, to thy name an heifer most select,"
300,9,278,"That never yet was tam’d with yoke, broad - fronted, one year old,"
300,9,279,"I’ll burn in zealous sacrifice, and set the horns in gold.”"
300,9,280,The Goddess heard; and both the kings their dreadless passage bore
300,9,281,"Through slaughter, slaughter’d carcasses, arms, and discolour’d gore."
300,9,282,"Nor Hector let his princes sleep, but all to council call’d,"
300,9,283,"And ask’d, “What one is here will vow, and keep it unappall’d,"
300,9,284,"To have a gift fit for his deed, a chariot and two horse,"
300,9,285,"That pass for speed the rest of Greece? What one dares take this course,"
300,9,286,"For his renown, besides his gifts, to mix amongst the foe,"
300,9,287,"And learn if still they hold their guards, or with this overthrow"
300,9,288,"Determine flight, as being too weak to hold us longer war?”"
300,9,289,"All silent stood; at last stood forth one Dolon, that did dare"
300,9,290,"This dang’rous work, Eumedes’ heir, a herald much renown’d."
300,9,291,"This Dolon did in gold and brass exceedingly abound,"
300,9,292,"But in his form was quite deform’d, yet passing swift to run;"
300,9,293,"Amongst five sisters, he was left Eumedes’ only son."
300,9,294,"And he told Hector, his free heart would undertake t’ explore"
300,9,295,"The Greeks’ intentions, “but,” said he, “thou shalt be sworn before,"
300,9,296,"By this thy sceptre, that the horse of great Æacides,"
300,9,297,"And his strong chariot bound with brass, thou wilt (before all these)"
300,9,298,Resign me as my valour’s prise; and so I rest unmov’d
300,9,299,"To be thy spy, and not return before I have approv’d"
300,9,300,"(By vent’ring to Atrides’ ship, where their consults are held)"
300,9,301,"If they resolve still to resist, or fly as quite expell’d.”"
300,9,302,"He put his sceptre in his hand, and call’d the thunder’s God,"
300,9,303,"Saturnia’s husband, to his oath, those horse should not be rode"
300,9,304,"By any other man than he, but he for ever joy"
300,9,305,"(To his renown) their services, for his good done to Troy."
300,9,306,"Thus swore he, and forswore himself, yet made base Dolon bold;"
300,9,307,"Who on his shoulders hung his bow, and did about him fold"
300,9,308,"A white wolf’s hide, and with a helm of weasels’ skins did arm"
300,9,309,"His weasel’s head, then took his dart, and never turn’d to harm"
300,9,310,The Greeks with their related drifts; but being past the troops
300,9,311,"Of horse and foot, he promptly runs, and as he runs he stoops"
300,9,312,"To undermine Achilles’ horse. Ulysses straight did see,"
300,9,313,"And said to Diomed: “This man makes footing towards thee,"
300,9,314,"Out of the tents. I know not well, if he be us’d as spy"
300,9,315,"Bent to our fleet, or come to rob the slaughter’d enemy."
300,9,316,"But let us suffer him to come a little further on,"
300,9,317,"And then pursue him. If it chance, that we be overgone"
300,9,318,"By his more swiftness, urge him still to run upon our fleet,"
300,9,319,And (lest he ’scape us to the town) still let thy jav’lin meet
300,9,320,With all his offers of retreat.” Thus stepp’d they from the plain
300,9,321,"Amongst the slaughter’d carcasses. Dolon came on amain,"
300,9,322,"Suspecting nothing; but once past, as far as mules outdraw"
300,9,323,"Oxen at plough, being both put on, neither admitted law,"
300,9,324,"To plough a deep - soil’d furrow forth, so far was Dolon past."
300,9,325,"Then they pursu’d, which he perceiv’d, and stay’d his speedless haste,"
300,9,326,Subtly supposing Hector sent to countermand his spy;
300,9,327,"But, in a jav’lin’s throw or less, he knew them enemy."
300,9,328,"Then laid he on his nimble knees, and they pursu’d like wind."
300,9,329,"As when a brace of greyhounds are laid in with hare and hind,"
300,9,330,"Close - mouth’d and skill’d to make the best of their industrious course,"
300,9,331,"Serve either’s turn, and, set on hard, lose neither ground nor force;"
300,9,332,"So constantly did Tydeus’ son, and his town - razing peer,"
300,9,333,"Pursue this spy, still turning him, as he was winding near"
300,9,334,"His covert, till he almost mix’d with their out - courts of guard."
300,9,335,"Then Pallas prompted Diomed, lest his due worth’s reward"
300,9,336,Should be impair’d if any man did vaunt he first did sheath
300,9,337,"His sword in him, and he be call’d but second in his death."
300,9,338,"Then spake he, threat’ning with his lance: “Or stay, or this comes on,"
300,9,339,And long thou canst not run before thou be by death outgone.”
300,9,340,"This said, he threw his jav’lin forth; which missed as Diomed would,"
300,9,341,"Above his right arm making way, the pile stuck in the mould."
300,9,342,"He stay’d and trembled, and his teeth did chatter in his head."
300,9,343,"They came in blowing, seiz’d him fast; he, weeping, offeréd"
300,9,344,"A wealthy ransom for his life, and told them he had brass,"
300,9,345,"Much gold, and iron, that fit for use in many labours was,"
300,9,346,"From whose rich heaps his father would a wondrous portion give,"
300,9,347,"If, at the great Achaian fleet, he heard his son did live."
300,9,348,"Ulysses bad him cheer his heart. “Think not of death,” said he,"
300,9,349,"“But tell us true, why runn’st thou forth, when others sleeping be?"
300,9,350,Is it to spoil the carcasses? Or art thou choicely sent
300,9,351,T’ explore our drifts? Or of thyself seek’st thou some wish’d event?”
300,9,352,"He trembling answer’d: “Much reward did Hector’s oath propose,"
300,9,353,"And urg’d me, much against my will, t’ endeavour to disclose"
300,9,354,"If you determin’d still to stay, or bent your course for flight,"
300,9,355,"As all dismay’d with your late foil, and wearied with the fight."
300,9,356,"For which exploit, Pelides’ horse and chariot he did swear,"
300,9,357,I only ever should enjoy.” Ulysses smil’d to hear
300,9,358,"So base a swain have any hope so high a prise t’ aspire,"
300,9,359,"And said, his labours did affect a great and precious hire,"
300,9,360,And that the horse Pelides rein’d no mortal hand could use
300,9,361,"But he himself, whose matchless life a Goddess did produce."
300,9,362,"“But tell us, and report but truth, where left’st thou Hector now?"
300,9,363,Where are his arms? His famous horse? On whom doth he bestow
300,9,364,The watch’s charge? Where sleep the kings? Intend they still to lie
300,9,365,"Thus near encamp’d, or turn suffic’d with their late victory?”"
300,9,366,"“All this,” said he, “I’ll tell most true. At Ilus’ monument"
300,9,367,"Hector with all our princes sits, t’ advise of this event;"
300,9,368,Who choose that place remov’d to shun the rude confuséd sounds
300,9,369,"The common soldiers throw about. But, for our watch, and rounds,"
300,9,370,"Whereof, brave lord, thou mak’st demand, none orderly we keep."
300,9,371,"The Trojans, that have roofs to save, only abandon sleep,"
300,9,372,And privately without command each other they exhort
300,9,373,To make prevention of the worst; and in this slender sort
300,9,374,Is watch and guard maintain’d with us. Th’ auxiliary bands
300,9,375,"Sleep soundly, and commit their cares into the Trojans’ hands,"
300,9,376,"For they have neither wives with them, nor children to protect;"
300,9,377,"The less they need to care, the more they succour dull neglect.”"
300,9,378,"“But tell me,” said wise Ithacus, “are all these foreign pow’rs"
300,9,379,"Appointed quarters by themselves, or else commix’d with yours?”"
300,9,380,"“And this,” said Dolon, “too, my lords, I’ll seriously unfold."
300,9,381,"The Pæons with the crookéd bows, and Cares, quarters hold"
300,9,382,"Next to the sea, the Leleges, and Caucons, join’d with them,"
300,9,383,"And brave Pelasgians. Thymber’s mead, remov’d more from the stream,"
300,9,384,"Is quarter to the Lycians, the lofty Mysian force,"
300,9,385,"The Phrygians and Meonians, that fight with arméd horse."
300,9,386,But what need these particulars? If ye intend surprise
300,9,387,"Of any in our Trojan camps, the Thracian quarter lies"
300,9,388,"Utmost of all, and uncommix’d with Trojan regiments,"
300,9,389,That keep the voluntary watch. New pitch’d are all their tents.
300,9,390,"King Rhesus, Eioneus’ son, commands them, who hath steeds"
300,9,391,"More white than snow, huge, and well - shap’d, their fi’ry pace exceeds"
300,9,392,The winds in swiftness; these I saw; his chariot is with gold
300,9,393,"And pallid silver richly fram’d, and wondrous to behold;"
300,9,394,"His great and golden armour is not fit a man should wear,"
300,9,395,"But for immortal shoulders fram’d. Come then, and quickly bear"
300,9,396,"Your happy pris’ner to your fleet; or leave him here fast bound,"
300,9,397,Till your well - urg’d and rich return prove my relation sound.”
300,9,398,"Tydides dreadfully replied: “Think not of passage thus,"
300,9,399,"Though of right acceptable news thou hast advértised us,"
300,9,400,Our hands are holds more strict than so; and should we set thee free
300,9,401,"For offer’d ransom, for this ’scape thou still wouldst scouting be"
300,9,402,"About our ships, or do us scathe in plain opposed arms,"
300,9,403,"But, if I take thy life, no way can we repent thy harms.”"
300,9,404,"With this, as Dolon reach’d his hand to use a suppliant’s part,"
300,9,405,"And stroke the beard of Diomed, he strook his neck athwart"
300,9,406,"With his forc’d sword, and both the nerves he did in sunder wound,"
300,9,407,"And suddenly his head, deceiv’d, fell speaking on the ground."
300,9,408,"His weasel’s helm they took, his bow, his wolf’s skin, and his lance,"
300,9,409,"Which to Minerva Ithacus did zealously advance,"
300,9,410,With lifted arm into the air; and to her thus he spake:
300,9,411,"“Goddess, triumph in thine own spoils; to thee we first will make"
300,9,412,"Our invocations, of all pow’rs thron’d on th’ Olympian hill;"
300,9,413,"Now to the Thracians, and their horse, and beds, conduct us still.”"
300,9,414,"With this, he hung them up aloft upon a tamrick bough"
300,9,415,"As eyeful trophies, and the sprigs that did about it grow"
300,9,416,"He proinéd from the leafy arms, to make it easier view’d"
300,9,417,"When they should hastily retire, and be perhaps pursu’d,"
300,9,418,"Forth went they through black blood and arms, and presently aspir’d"
300,9,419,"The guardless Thracian regiment, fast bound with sleep, and tir’d;"
300,9,420,"Their arms lay by, and triple ranks they, as they slept, did keep,"
300,9,421,"As they should watch and guard their king, who, in a fatal sleep,"
300,9,422,"Lay in the midst; their chariot horse, as they coach - fellows were,"
300,9,423,"Fed by them; and the famous steeds, that did their gen’ral bear,"
300,9,424,"Stood next him, to the hinder part of his rich chariot tied."
300,9,425,"Ulysses saw them first, and said, “Tydides, I have spied"
300,9,426,"The horse that Dolon, whom we slew, assur’d us we should see."
300,9,427,Now use thy strength; now idle arms are most unfit for thee;
300,9,428,"Prise thou the horse; or kill the guard, and leave the horse to me.”"
300,9,429,"Minerva, with the azure eyes, breath’d strength into her king,"
300,9,430,"Who filled the tent with mixéd death. The souls, he set on wing,"
300,9,431,"Issu’d in groans, and made air swell into her stormy flood."
300,9,432,"Horror and slaughter had one pow’r, the earth did blush with blood."
300,9,433,"As when a hungry lion flies, with purpose to devour,"
300,9,434,"On flocks unkept, and on their lives doth freely use his pow’r;"
300,9,435,So Tydeus’ son assail’d the foe; twelve souls before him flew;
300,9,436,"Ulysses waited on his sword, and ever as he slew,"
300,9,437,He drew them by their strengthless heels out of the horses’ sight.
300,9,438,"That, when he was to lead them forth, they should not with affright"
300,9,439,"Boggle, nor snore, in treading on the bloody carcasses;"
300,9,440,"For being new come, they were unus’d to such stern sights as these."
300,9,441,"Through four ranks now did Diomed the king himself attain,"
300,9,442,"Who, snoring in his sweetest sleep, was like his soldiers slain."
300,9,443,"An ill dream by Minerva sent that night stood by his head,"
300,9,444,"Which was Oenides’ royal, unconquer’d Diomed."
300,9,445,"Meanwhile Ulysses loos’d his horse, took all their reins in hand,"
300,9,446,And led them forth; but Tydeus’ son did in contention stand
300,9,447,With his great mind to do some deed of more audacity;
300,9,448,"If he should take the chariot, where his rich arms did lie,"
300,9,449,"And draw it by the beam away, or bear it on his back,"
300,9,450,"Or if, of more dull Thracian lives, he should their bosoms sack."
300,9,451,"In this contention with himself, Minerva did suggest"
300,9,452,And bade him think of his retreat; lest from their tempted rest
300,9,453,"Some other God should stir the foe, and send him back dismay’d."
300,9,454,"He knew the voice, took horse, and fled. The Trojan’s heav’nly aid,"
300,9,455,"Apollo with the silver bow, stood no blind sentinel"
300,9,456,"To their secure and drowsy host, but did discover well"
300,9,457,"Minerva following Diomed; and, angry with his act,"
300,9,458,"The mighty host of Ilion he enter’d, and awak’d"
300,9,459,"The cousin - german of the king, a counsellor of Thrace,"
300,9,460,"Hippocoon; who when he rose, and saw the desert place,"
300,9,461,"Where Rhesus’ horse did use to stand, and th’ other dismal harms,"
300,9,462,"Men struggling with the pangs of death, he shriek’d out thick alarms,"
300,9,463,"Call’d “Rhesus! Rhesus!” but in vain; then still, “Arm! Arm!” he cried."
300,9,464,The noise and tumult was extreme on every startled side
300,9,465,"Of Troy’s huge host; from whence in throngs all gather’d, and admir’d"
300,9,466,"Who could perform such harmful facts, and yet be safe retir’d,"
300,9,467,"Now, coming where they slew the scout, Ulysses stay’d the steeds,"
300,9,468,"Tydides lighted, and the spoils, hung on the tamrick reeds,"
300,9,469,"He took and gave to Ithacus, and up he got again."
300,9,470,Then flew they joyful to their fleet. Nestor did first attain
300,9,471,"The sounds the horse - hoofs strook through air, and said: “My royal"
300,9,472,peers!
300,9,473,"Do I but dote, or say I true? Methinks about mine ears"
300,9,474,The sounds of running horses beat. O would to God they were
300,9,475,"Our friends thus soon return’d with spoils! But I have hearty fear,"
300,9,476,Lest this high tumult of the foe doth their distress intend.”
300,9,477,"He scarce had spoke, when they were come. Both did from horse descend."
300,9,478,"All, with embraces and sweet words, to heav’n their worth did raise."
300,9,479,"Then Nestor spake: “Great Ithacus, ev’n heap’d with Grecian praise,"
300,9,480,How have you made these horse your prise? Pierc’d you the dang’rous
300,9,481,"host,"
300,9,482,"Where such gems stand? Or did some God your high attempts accost,"
300,9,483,"And honour’d you with this reward? Why, they be like the rays"
300,9,484,The sun effuseth. I have mix’d with Trojans all my days;
300,9,485,"And now, I hope you will not say, I always lie aboard,"
300,9,486,Though an old soldier I confess; yet did all Troy afford
300,9,487,Never the like to any sense that ever I possess’d.
300,9,488,"But some good God, no doubt, hath met, and your high valours bless’d,"
300,9,489,"For He that shadows heav’n with clouds loves both as his delights,"
300,9,490,And She that supples earth with blood cannot forbear your sights.”
300,9,491,"Ulysses answer’d: “Honour’d sire, the willing Gods can give"
300,9,492,"Horse much more worth than these men yield, since in more pow’r they"
300,9,493,live.
300,9,494,"These horse are of the Thracian breed; their king, Tydides slew,"
300,9,495,And twelve of his most trusted guard; and of that meaner crew
300,9,496,"A scout for thirteenth man we kill’d, whom Hector sent to spy"
300,9,497,"The whole estate of our designs, if bent to fight or fly.”"
300,9,498,"Thus, follow’d with whole troops of friends, they with applauses"
300,9,499,pass’d
300,9,500,"The spacious dike, and in the tent of Diomed they plac’d"
300,9,501,"The horse without contention, as his deserving’s meed,"
300,9,502,"Which, with his other horse set up, on yellow wheat did feed."
300,9,503,"Poor Dolon’s spoils Ulysses had; who shrin’d them on his stern,"
300,9,504,As trophies vow’d to her that sent the good - aboding hern.
300,9,505,"Then enter’d they the mere main sea, to cleanse their honour’d sweat"
300,9,506,"From off their feet, their thighs and necks; and, when their vehement"
300,9,507,heat
300,9,508,"Was calm’d, and their swoln hearts refresh’d, more curious baths they"
300,9,509,"us’d,"
300,9,510,"Where od’rous and dissolving oils, they through their limbs diffus’d."
300,9,511,"Then, taking breakfast, a big bowl, fill’d with the purest wine,"
300,9,512,"They offer’d to the Maiden Queen, that hath the azure eyne."
300,9,513,THE END OF THE TENTH BOOK.
300,9,514,"[1] These are the lightnings before snow, etc. that Scaliger’s"
300,9,515,"Criticus so unworthily taxeth; citing the place falsely, as in the"
300,9,516,"third book’s annotations, etc."
300,9,517,"[2] _᾽Επὶ ξυρου̑ ἵσταται ἀκμη̑ς_. This went into a proverb, used by"
300,9,518,"Theocritus, _in Dioscuris_, out of Homer."
300,10,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,10,2,Atrides and his other peers of name
300,10,3,Lead forth their men; whom Eris oath enflame.
300,10,4,"Hector (by Iris’ charge) takes deedless breath,"
300,10,5,"Whiles Agamemnon plies the work of death,"
300,10,6,Who with the first bears his imperial head.
300,10,7,"Himself, Ulysses, and King Diomed,"
300,10,8,"Eurypylus, and Æsculapius’ son,"
300,10,9,(Enforc’d with wounds) the furious skirmish shun.
300,10,10,"Which martial sight when great Achilles views,"
300,10,11,A little his desire of fight renews;
300,10,12,"And forth he sends his friend, to bring him word"
300,10,13,"From old Neleides, what wounded lord"
300,10,14,He in his chariot from the skirmish brought;
300,10,15,Which was Machaon. Nestor then besought
300,10,16,"He would persuade his friend to wreak their harms,"
300,10,17,"Or come himself, deck’d in his dreadful arms."
300,10,18,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,10,19,"Lambda presents the General,"
300,10,20,"In fight the worthiest man of all,"
300,10,21,"Aurora out of restful bed did from bright Tithon rise,"
300,10,22,"To bring each deathless Essence light, and use to mortal eyes;"
300,10,23,"When Jove sent Eris to the Greeks, sustaining in her hand"
300,10,24,Stern signs of her designs for war. She took her horrid stand
300,10,25,"Upon Ulysses’ huge black bark, that did at anchor ride"
300,10,26,"Amidst the fleet, from whence her sounds might ring on ev’ry side,"
300,10,27,"Both to the tents of Telamon, and th’ author of their smarts,"
300,10,28,"Who held, for fortitude and force, the navy’s utmost parts."
300,10,29,"The red - ey’d Goddess, seated there, thunder’d the Orthian song,"
300,10,30,"High, and with horror, through the ears of all the Grecian throng,"
300,10,31,"Her verse with spirits invincible did all their breasts inspire,"
300,10,32,"Blew out all darkness from their limbs, and set their hearts on fire;"
300,10,33,"And presently was bitter war more sweet a thousand times,"
300,10,34,Than any choice in hollow keels to greet their native climes.
300,10,35,"Atrides summon’d all to arms, to arms himself dispos’d,"
300,10,36,"First on his legs he put bright greaves, with silver buttons clos’d;"
300,10,37,"Then with rich curace arm’d his breast, which Cinyras bestow’d"
300,10,38,To gratify his royal guest; for ev’n to Cyprus flowed
300,10,39,"Th’ unbounded fame of those designs the Greeks propos’d for Troy,"
300,10,40,"And therefore gave he him those arms, and wish’d his purpose joy."
300,10,41,"Ten rows of azure mix’d with black, twelve golden like the sun,"
300,10,42,"Twice - ten of tin, in beaten paths, did through this armour run."
300,10,43,"Three serpents to the gorget crept, that like three rainbows shin’d,"
300,10,44,"Such as by Jove are fix’d in clouds, when wonders are divin’d."
300,10,45,"About his shoulders hung his sword, whereof the hollow hilt"
300,10,46,"Was fashion’d all with shining bars, exceeding richly gilt;"
300,10,47,"The scabbard was of silver plate, with golden hangers grac’d."
300,10,48,"Then he took up his weighty shield, that round about him cast"
300,10,49,Defensive shadows; ten bright zones of gold - affecting brass
300,10,50,"Were driv’n about it; and of tin, as full of gloss as glass,"
300,10,51,Swell’d twenty bosses out of it; in centre of them all
300,10,52,"One of black metal had engrav’n, full of extreme appall,"
300,10,53,"An ugly Gorgon, compasséd with Terror and with Fear."
300,10,54,"At it a silver bawdrick hung, with which he us’d to bear,"
300,10,55,"Wound on his arm, his ample shield; and in it there was wov’n"
300,10,56,"An azure dragon, curl’d in folds, from whose one neck was clov’n"
300,10,57,Three heads contorted in an orb. Then plac’d he on his head
300,10,58,"His four - plum’d casque; and in his hands two darts he managéd,"
300,10,59,"Arm’d with bright steel that blaz’d to heav’n. Then Juno, and the Maid"
300,10,60,"That conquers empires, trumpets serv’d to summon out their aid"
300,10,61,"In honour of the General, and on a sable cloud,"
300,10,62,"To bring them furious to the field, sat thund’ring out aloud."
300,10,63,"Then all enjoin’d their charioteers, to rank their chariot horse"
300,10,64,"Close to the dike. Forth march’d the foot, whose front they did"
300,10,65,r’enforce
300,10,66,"With some horse troops. The battle then was all of charioteers,"
300,10,67,"Lin’d with light horse. But Jupiter disturb’d this form with fears,"
300,10,68,"And from air’s upper region bid bloody vapours rain,"
300,10,69,For sad ostent much noble life should ere their times be slain.
300,10,70,The Trojan host at Ilus’ tomb was in battalia led
300,10,71,"By Hector and Polydamas, and old Anchises’ seed"
300,10,72,"Who god - like was esteem’d in Troy, by grave Antenor’s race"
300,10,73,"Divine Agenor, Polybus, unmarried Acamas"
300,10,74,"Proportion’d like the States of heav’n. In front of all the field,"
300,10,75,"Troy’s great Priamides did bear his all - ways - equal shield,"
300,10,76,Still plying th’ ord’ring of his pow’r. And as amids the sky
300,10,77,"We sometimes see an ominous star blaze clear and dreadfully,"
300,10,78,"Then run his golden head in clouds, and straight appear again;"
300,10,79,"So Hector otherwhiles did grace the vaunt - guard, shining plain,"
300,10,80,"Then in the rear - guard hid himself, and labour’d ev’rywhere"
300,10,81,"To order and encourage all; his armour was so clear,"
300,10,82,"And he applied each place so fast, that, like a lightning thrown"
300,10,83,"Out of the shield of Jupiter, in ev’ry eye he shone."
300,10,84,"And as upon a rich man’s crop of barley or of wheat,"
300,10,85,"Oppos’d for swiftness at their work, a sort of reaper’s sweat,"
300,10,86,"Bear down the furrows speedily, and thick their handfuls fall;"
300,10,87,"So at the joining of the hosts ran slaughter through them all,"
300,10,88,"None stoop’d to any fainting thought of foul inglorious flight,"
300,10,89,"But equal bore they up their heads, and far’d like wolves in fight."
300,10,90,"Stern Eris, with such weeping sights, rejoic’d to feed her eyes,"
300,10,91,"Who only show’d herself in field, of all the Deities;"
300,10,92,"The other in Olympus’ tops sat silent, and repined"
300,10,93,That Jove to do the Trojans grace should bear so fix’d a mind.
300,10,94,"He car’d not, but, enthron’d apart, triumphant sat in sway"
300,10,95,"Of his free pow’r, and from his seat took pleasure to display"
300,10,96,"The city so adorn’d with tow’rs, the sea with vessels fill’d,"
300,10,97,"The splendour of refulgent arms, the killer and the kill’d."
300,10,98,"As long as bright Aurora rul’d, and sacred day increas’d,"
300,10,99,"So long their darts made mutual wounds, and neither had the best;"
300,10,100,"But when, in hill - environ’d vales, the timber - feller takes"
300,10,101,"A sharp set stomach to his meat, and dinner ready makes,"
300,10,102,"His sinews fainting, and his spirits become surcharg’d and dull,"
300,10,103,"Time of accustom’d ease arriv’d, his hands with labour full,"
300,10,104,"Then by their valours Greeks brake through the Trojan ranks, and"
300,10,105,cheer’d
300,10,106,Their gen’ral squadrons through the host; then first of all appear’d
300,10,107,The person of the king himself; and then the Trojans lost
300,10,108,"Bianor by his royal charge, a leader in the host."
300,10,109,"Who being slain, his charioteer, Oïleus, did alight,"
300,10,110,And stood in skirmish with the king; the king did deadly smite
300,10,111,"His forehead with his eager lance, and through his helm it ran,"
300,10,112,"Enforcing passage to his brain, quite through the harden’d pan,"
300,10,113,"His brain mix’d with his clotter’d blood, his body strew’d the ground."
300,10,114,"There left he them, and presently he other objects found;"
300,10,115,"Isus and Antiphus, two sons King Priam did beget,"
300,10,116,"One lawful, th’ other wantonly. Both in one chariot met"
300,10,117,"Their royal foe; the baser born, Isus, was charioteer,"
300,10,118,"And famous Antiphus did fight; both which king Peleus’ heir,"
300,10,119,"Whilome in Ida keeping flocks, did deprehend and bind"
300,10,120,"With pliant osiers, and, for price, them to their sire resign’d."
300,10,121,"Atrides, with his well - aim’d lance, smote Isus on the breast"
300,10,122,Above the nipple; and his sword a mortal wound impress’d
300,10,123,Beneath the ear of Antiphus; down from their horse they fell.
300,10,124,"The king had seen the youths before, and now did know them well,"
300,10,125,"Rememb’ring them the prisoners of swift Æacides,"
300,10,126,Who brought them to the sable fleet from Ida’s foody leas.
300,10,127,"And as a lion having found the furrow of a hind,"
300,10,128,"Where she hath calv’d two little twins, at will and ease doth grind"
300,10,129,"Their joints snatch’d in his solid jaws, and crusheth into mist"
300,10,130,"Their tender lives; their dam, though near, not able to resist,"
300,10,131,"But shook with vehement fear herself, flies through the oaken chace"
300,10,132,"From that fell savage, drown’d in sweat, and seeks some covert place;"
300,10,133,So when with most unmatched strength the Grecian Gen’ral bent
300,10,134,"‘Gainst these two princes, none durst aid their native king’s descent,"
300,10,135,"But fled themselves before the Greeks. And where these two were slain,"
300,10,136,Pisander and Hippolochus (not able to restrain
300,10,137,"Their headstrong horse, the silken reins being from their hands let"
300,10,138,fall)
300,10,139,Were brought by their unruly guides before the General.
300,10,140,"Antimachus begat them both, Antimachus that took"
300,10,141,"Rich gifts, and gold, of Helen’s love, and would by no means brook"
300,10,142,"Just restitution should be made of Menelaus’ wealth,"
300,10,143,"Bereft him, with his ravish’d queen, by Alexander’s stealth."
300,10,144,"Atrides, lion - like, did charge his sons, who on their knees"
300,10,145,"Fell from their chariot, and besought regard to their degrees,"
300,10,146,"Who, being Antimachus’s sons, their father would afford"
300,10,147,"A worthy ransom for their lives, who in his house did hoard"
300,10,148,"Much hidden treasure, brass, and gold, and steel, wrought wondrous"
300,10,149,choice.
300,10,150,"Thus wept they, using smoothing terms, and heard this rugged voice"
300,10,151,Breath’d from the unrelenting king: “If you be of the breed
300,10,152,"Of stout Antimachus, that stay’d the honourable deed"
300,10,153,"The other peers of Ilion in council had decreed,"
300,10,154,To render Helen and her wealth; and would have basely slain
300,10,155,"My brother and wise Ithacus, ambassadors t’ attain"
300,10,156,The most due motion; now receive wreak for his shameful part.”
300,10,157,"This said, in poor Pisander’s breast he fix’d his wreakful dart,"
300,10,158,"Who upward spread th’ oppresséd earth; his brother crouch’d for dread,"
300,10,159,"And, as he lay, the angry king cut off his arms and head,"
300,10,160,And let him like a football lie for ev’ry man to spurn.
300,10,161,"Then to th’ extremest heat of fight he did his valour turn,"
300,10,162,"And led a multitude of Greeks, where foot did foot subdue,"
300,10,163,"Horse slaughter’d horse, Need feather’d flight, the batter’d centre"
300,10,164,flew
300,10,165,"In clouds of dust about their ears, raised from the horses’ hooves,"
300,10,166,That beat a thunder out of earth as horrible as Jove’s.
300,10,167,"The king, persuading speedy chace, gave his persuasions way"
300,10,168,"With his own valour, slaught’ring still. As in a stormy day"
300,10,169,In thick - set woods a rav’nous fire wraps in his fierce repair
300,10,170,"The shaken trees, and by the roots doth toss them into air;"
300,10,171,"Ev’n so beneath Atrides’ sword flew up Troy’s flying heels,"
300,10,172,"Their horse drew empty chariots, and sought their thund’ring wheels"
300,10,173,"Some fresh directors through the field, where least the púrsuit drives."
300,10,174,"Thick fell the Trojans, much more sweet to vultures than their wives."
300,10,175,"Then Jove drew Hector from the darts, from dust, from death and blood,"
300,10,176,"And from the tumult. Still the king firm to the púrsuit stood,"
300,10,177,"Till at old Ilus’ monument, in midst of all the field,"
300,10,178,"They reach’d the wild fig - tree, and long’d to make their town their"
300,10,179,shield.
300,10,180,"Yet there they rested not; the king still cried, ‘Pursue! Pursue!’"
300,10,181,And all his unreprovéd hands did blood and dust imbrue.
300,10,182,"But when they came to Scæa’s ports, and to the beech of Jove,"
300,10,183,"There made they stand; there ev’ry eye, fixed on each other, strove"
300,10,184,Who should outlook his mate amaz’d; through all the field they fled.
300,10,185,"And as a lion, when the night becomes most deaf and dead,"
300,10,186,"Invades ox - herds, affrighting all, that he of one may wreak"
300,10,187,"His dreadful hunger, and his neck he first of all doth break,"
300,10,188,Then laps his blood and entrails up; so Agamemnon plied
300,10,189,"The manage of the Trojan chace, and still the last man died,"
300,10,190,"The other fled, a number fell by his imperial hand,"
300,10,191,"Some grovelling downwards from their horse, some upwards strew’d the"
300,10,192,sand.
300,10,193,"High was the fury of his lance. But, having beat them close"
300,10,194,"Beneath their walls, the both worlds’ Sire did now again repose"
300,10,195,"On fountain - flowing Ida’s tops, being newly slid from heav’n,"
300,10,196,And held a lightning in his hand; from thence this charge was giv’n
300,10,197,"To Iris with the golden wings: “Thaumantia, fly,” said he,"
300,10,198,"“And tell Troy’s Hector, that as long as he enrag’d shall see"
300,10,199,"The soldier - loving Atreus’ son amongst the foremost fight,"
300,10,200,"Depopulating troops of men, so long he must excite"
300,10,201,"Some other to resist the foe, and he no arms advance;"
300,10,202,"But when he wounded takes his horse, attain’d with shaft or lance,"
300,10,203,"Then will I fill his arm with death, ev’n till he reach the fleet,"
300,10,204,And peaceful night treads busy day beneath her sacred feet.”
300,10,205,"The wind - foot swift Thaumantia obey’d, and us’d her wings"
300,10,206,"To famous Ilion, from the mount enchas’d with silver springs,"
300,10,207,"And found in his bright chariot the hardy Trojan knight,"
300,10,208,"To whom she spake the words of Jove, and vanish’d from his sight."
300,10,209,"He leapt upon the sounding earth, and shook his lengthful dart,"
300,10,210,"And ev’rywhere he breath’d exhorts, and stirr’d up ev’ry heart."
300,10,211,A dreadful fight he set on foot. His soldiers straight turn’d head.
300,10,212,"The Greeks stood firm. In both the hosts, the field was perfected."
300,10,213,"But Agamemnon, foremost still, did all his side exceed,"
300,10,214,And would not be the first in name unless the first in deed.
300,10,215,"Now sing, fair Presidents of verse, that in the heav’ns embow’r,"
300,10,216,"Who first encounter’d with the king, of all the adverse pow’r."
300,10,217,"Iphidamas, Antenor’s son, ample and bigly set,"
300,10,218,"Brought up in pasture - springing Thrace, that doth soft sheep beget,"
300,10,219,"In grave Cisseus’ noble house, that was his mother’s sire,"
300,10,220,Fair Theano; and when his breast was heighten’d with the fire
300,10,221,"Of gaysome youth, his grandsire gave his daughter to his love."
300,10,222,"Who straight his bridal - chamber left. Fame with affection strove,"
300,10,223,"And made him furnish twelve fair ships, to lend fair Troy his hand."
300,10,224,"His ships he in Percope left, and came to Troy by land."
300,10,225,"And now he tried the fame of Greece, encount’ring with the king,"
300,10,226,"Who threw his royal lance and miss’d. Iphidamas did fling,"
300,10,227,"And strook him on the arming waist, beneath his coat of brass,"
300,10,228,"Which forc’d him stay upon his arm, so violent it was,"
300,10,229,"Yet pierc’d it not his well - wrought zone, but when the lazy head"
300,10,230,"Tried hardness with his silver waist, it turn’d again like lead."
300,10,231,"He follow’d, grasping the ground end, but with a lion’s wile"
300,10,232,"That wrests away a hunter’s staff, he caught it by the pile,"
300,10,233,"And pluck’d it from the caster’s hand, whom with his sword he strook"
300,10,234,"Beneath the ear, and with his wound his timeless death he took."
300,10,235,"He fell and slept an iron sleep; wretched young man, he died,"
300,10,236,"Far from his newly - married wife, in aid of foreign pride,"
300,10,237,"And saw no pleasure of his love; yet was her jointure great,"
300,10,238,"An hundred oxen gave he her, and vow’d in his retreat"
300,10,239,"Two thousand head of sheep and goats, of which he store did leave."
300,10,240,"Much gave he of his love’s first - fruits, and nothing did receive."
300,10,241,"When Coon (one that for his form might feast an amorous eye,"
300,10,242,"And elder brother of the slain) beheld this tragedy,"
300,10,243,"Deep sorrow sat upon his eyes, and (standing laterally,"
300,10,244,"And to the Gen’ral undiscern’d) his jav’lin he let fly,"
300,10,245,That ’twixt his elbow and his wrist transfix’d his armless arm;
300,10,246,The bright head shin’d on th’ other side. The unexpected harm
300,10,247,"Impress’d some horror in the king; yet so he ceas’d not fight,"
300,10,248,"But rush’d on Coon with his lance, who made what haste he might,"
300,10,249,"Seizing his slaughter’d brother’s foot, to draw him from the field,"
300,10,250,"And call’d the ablest to his aid, when under his round shield"
300,10,251,"The king’s brass jav’lin, as he drew, did strike him helpless dead;"
300,10,252,"Who made Iphidamas the block, and cut off Coon’s head."
300,10,253,"Thus under great Atrides’ arm Antenor’s issue thriv’d,"
300,10,254,"And, to suffice precisest fate, to Pluto’s mansion div’d."
300,10,255,"He with his lance, sword, mighty stones, pour’d his heroic wreak"
300,10,256,"On other squadrons of the foe, whiles yet warm blood did break"
300,10,257,Through his cleft veins; but when the wound was quite exhaust and
300,10,258,"crude,"
300,10,259,The eager anguish did approve his princely fortitude.
300,10,260,"As when most sharp and bitter pangs distract a labouring dame,"
300,10,261,"Which the divine Ilithyæ, that rule the painful frame"
300,10,262,"Of human child - birth, pour on her; th’ Ilithyæ that are"
300,10,263,The daughters of Saturnia; with whose extreme repair
300,10,264,"The woman in her travail strives to take the worst it gives,"
300,10,265,"With thought it must be, ’tis love’s fruit, the end for which she"
300,10,266,"lives,"
300,10,267,"The mean to make herself new born, what comforts will redound;"
300,10,268,So Agamemnon did sustain the torment of his wound.
300,10,269,"Then took he chariot, and to fleet bad haste his charioteer,"
300,10,270,But first pour’d out his highest voice to purchase ev’ry ear:
300,10,271,"“Princes and leaders of the Greeks, brave friends, now from our fleet"
300,10,272,Do you expel this boist’rous sway. Jove will not let me meet
300,10,273,"Illustrate Hector, nor give leave that I shall end the day"
300,10,274,In fight against the Ilion pow’r; my wound is in my way.”
300,10,275,"This said, his ready charioteer did scourge his spriteful horse,"
300,10,276,That freely to the sable fleet perform’d their fi’ry course.
300,10,277,"To bear their wounded sovereign apart the martial thrust,"
300,10,278,"Sprinkling their pow’rful breasts with foam, and snowing on the dust."
300,10,279,"When Hector heard of his retreat, thus he for fame contends:"
300,10,280,"“Trojans, Dardanians, Lycians, all my close - fighting friends,"
300,10,281,"Think what it is to be renown’d, be soldiers all of name,"
300,10,282,"Our strongest enemy is gone, Jove vows to do us fame,"
300,10,283,"Then in the Grecian faces drive your one - hoof’d violent steeds,"
300,10,284,"And far above their best be best, and glorify your deeds.”"
300,10,285,Thus as a dog - giv’n hunter sets upon a brace of boars
300,10,286,"His white - tooth’d hounds, puffs, shouts, breathes terms, and on his"
300,10,287,emprese pours
300,10,288,All his wild art to make them pinch; so Hector urg’d his host
300,10,289,"To charge the Greeks, and, he himself most bold and active most,"
300,10,290,"He brake into the heat of fight, as when a tempest raves,"
300,10,291,"Stoops from the clouds, and all on heaps doth cuff the purple waves."
300,10,292,"Who then was first, and last, he kill’d, when Jove did grace his deed?"
300,10,293,"Assæus, and Autonous, Opys, and Clytus’ seed"
300,10,294,"Prince Dolops, and the honour’d sire of sweet Euryalus"
300,10,295,"Opheltes, Agelaus next, and strong Hipponous,"
300,10,296,"Orus, Æsymnus, all of name. The common soldiers fell,"
300,10,297,"As when the hollow flood of air in Zephyr’s cheeks doth swell,"
300,10,298,"And sparseth all the gather’d clouds white Notus’ pow’r did draw,"
300,10,299,"Wraps waves in waves, hurls up the froth beat with a vehement flaw;"
300,10,300,So were the common soldiers wrack’d in troops by Hector’s hand.
300,10,301,"Then ruin had enforc’d such works as no Greeks could withstand,"
300,10,302,"Then in their fleet they had been hous’d, had not Laertes’ son"
300,10,303,"Stirr’d up the spirit of Diomed, with this impression:"
300,10,304,"“Tydides, what do we sustain, forgetting what we are?"
300,10,305,"Stand by me, dearest in my love. ’Twere horrible impair"
300,10,306,"For our two valours to endure a customary flight,"
300,10,307,"To leave our navy still engag’d, and but by fits to fight.”"
300,10,308,"He answer’d: “I am bent to stay, and anything sustain;"
300,10,309,"But our delight to prove us men will prove but short and vain,"
300,10,310,"For Jove makes Trojans instruments, and virtually then"
300,10,311,Wields arms himself. Our cross affairs are not ’twixt men and men.”
300,10,312,"This said, Thymbræus with his lance he tumbled from his horse,"
300,10,313,Near his left nipple wounding him. Ulysses did enforce
300,10,314,"Fair Molion, minion to this king that Diomed subdu’d."
300,10,315,"Both sent they thence till they return’d, who now the king pursu’d"
300,10,316,And furrow’d through the thicken’d troops. As when two chaséd boars
300,10,317,"Turn head ’gainst kennels of bold hounds, and race way through their"
300,10,318,gores;
300,10,319,"So, turn’d from flight, the forward kings show’d Trojans backward"
300,10,320,death.
300,10,321,"Nor fled the Greeks, but by their wills, to get great Hector breath."
300,10,322,"Then took they horse and chariot from two bold city foes,"
300,10,323,"Merops Percosius’ mighty sons. Their father could disclose,"
300,10,324,"Beyond all men, hid auguries, and would not give consent"
300,10,325,"To their egression to these wars, yet wilfully they went,"
300,10,326,"For Fates, that order sable death, enforc’d their tragedies."
300,10,327,"Tydides slew them with his lance, and made their arms his prise."
300,10,328,"Hypirochus, and Hippodus, Ulysses reft of light."
300,10,329,"But Jove, that out of Ida look’d, then equalis’d the fight,"
300,10,330,A Grecian for a Trojan then paid tribute to the Fates.
300,10,331,"Yet royal Diomed slew one, ev’n in those even debates,"
300,10,332,"That was of name more than the rest, Pæon’s renownéd son,"
300,10,333,The prince Agastrophus; his lance into his hip did run;
300,10,334,"His squire detain’d his horse apart, that hinder’d him to fly,"
300,10,335,"Which he repented at his heart, yet did his feet apply"
300,10,336,"His ’scape with all the speed they had alongst the foremost bands,"
300,10,337,"And there his lovéd life dissolv’d. This Hector understands,"
300,10,338,"And rush’d with clamour on the king, right soundly seconded"
300,10,339,"With troops of Trojans. Which perceiv’d by famous Diomed,"
300,10,340,"The deep conceit of Jove’s high will stiffen’d his royal hair,"
300,10,341,Who spake to near - fought Ithacus: “The fate of this affair
300,10,342,"Is bent to us. Come let us stand, and bound his violence.”"
300,10,343,"Thus threw he his long jav’lin forth, which smote his head’s defence"
300,10,344,"Full on the top, yet pierc’d no skin; brass took repulse with brass;"
300,10,345,"His helm (with three folds made, and sharp) the gift of Phœbus was."
300,10,346,"The blow made Hector take the troop, sunk him upon his hand,"
300,10,347,And strook him blind. The king pursu’d before the foremost band
300,10,348,"His dart’s recov’ry, which he found laid on the purple plain;"
300,10,349,"By which time Hector was reviv’d, and, taking horse again,"
300,10,350,"Was far commix’d within his strength, and fled his darksome grave."
300,10,351,"He follow’d with his thirsty lance, and this elusive brave:"
300,10,352,"“Once more be thankful to thy heels, proud dog, for thy escape."
300,10,353,Mischief sat near thy bosom now; and now another rape
300,10,354,"Hath thy Apollo made of thee, to whom thou well mayst pray,"
300,10,355,When through the singing of our darts thou find’st such guarded way.
300,10,356,"But I shall meet with thee at length, and bring thy latest hour,"
300,10,357,If with like favour any God be fautour of my pow’r.
300,10,358,"Meanwhile some other shall repay, what I suspend in thee.”"
300,10,359,"This said, he set the wretched soul of Pæon’s issue free,"
300,10,360,Whom his late wound not fully slew. But Priam’s amorous birth
300,10,361,"Against Tydides bent his bow, hid with a hill of earth,"
300,10,362,"Part of the ruinated tomb for honour’d Ilus built,"
300,10,363,"And as the curace of the slain, engrav’n and richly gilt,"
300,10,364,"Tydides from his breast had spoil’d, and from his shoulders raft"
300,10,365,"His target and his solid helm, he shot, and his keen shaft"
300,10,366,(That never flew from him in vain) did nail unto the ground
300,10,367,The king’s right foot; the spleenful knight laugh’d sweetly at the
300,10,368,"wound,"
300,10,369,"Crept from his covert, and triumph’d: “Now art thou maim’d,” said he,"
300,10,370,“And would to God my happy hand had so much honour’d me
300,10,371,"To have infix’d it in thy breast, as deep as in thy foot,"
300,10,372,Ev’n to th’ expulsure of thy soul! Then blest had been my shoot
300,10,373,Of all the Trojans; who had then breath’d from their long unrests.
300,10,374,"Who fear thee, as the braying goats abhor the king of beasts.”"
300,10,375,"Undaunted Diomed replied: “You braver with your bow,"
300,10,376,"You slick - hair’d lover, you that hunt and fleer at wenches so,"
300,10,377,"Durst thou but stand in arms with me, thy silly archery"
300,10,378,Would give thee little cause to vaunt. As little suffer I
300,10,379,"In this same tall exploit of thine, perform’d when thou wert hid,"
300,10,380,"As if a woman, or a child that knew not what it did,"
300,10,381,Had touch’d my foot. A coward’s steel hath never any edge.
300,10,382,"But mine, t’ assure it sharp, still lays dead carcasses in pledge;"
300,10,383,"Touch it, it renders lifeless straight, it strikes the fingers’ ends"
300,10,384,"Of hapless widows in their cheeks, and children blind of friends."
300,10,385,"The subject of it makes earth red, and air with sighs inflames,"
300,10,386,And leaves limbs more embrac’d with birds than with enamour’d dames.”
300,10,387,"Lance - fam’d Ulysses now came in, and stept before the king,"
300,10,388,"Kneel’d opposite, and drew the shaft. The eager pain did sting"
300,10,389,"Through all his body. Straight he took his royal chariot there,"
300,10,390,And with direction to the fleet did charge his charioteer.
300,10,391,"Now was Ulysses desolate, fear made no friend remain,"
300,10,392,He thus spake to his mighty mind: “What doth my state sustain?
300,10,393,"If I should fly this odds in fear, that thus comes clust’ring on,"
300,10,394,"‘Twere high dishonour; yet ’twere worse, to be surpris’d alone."
300,10,395,’Tis Jove that drives the rest to fight; but that’s a faint excuse.
300,10,396,Why do I tempt my mind so much? Pale cowards fight refuse.
300,10,397,"He that affects renown in war must like a rock be fix’d,"
300,10,398,"Wound, or be wounded. Valour’s truth puts no respect betwixt.”"
300,10,399,"In this contention with himself, in flew the shady bands"
300,10,400,"Of targeteers, who sieg’d him round with mischief - filléd hands."
300,10,401,"As when a crew of gallants watch the wild muse of a boar,"
300,10,402,"Their dogs put after in full cry, he rusheth on before,"
300,10,403,"Whets, with his lather - making jaws, his crookéd tusks for blood,"
300,10,404,"And, holding firm his usual haunts, breaks through the deepen’d wood,"
300,10,405,"They charging, though his hot approach be never so abhorr’d;"
300,10,406,"So, to assail the Jove - lov’d Greek, the Ilians did accord,"
300,10,407,"And he made through them. First he hurt, upon his shoulder blade,"
300,10,408,"Deiops, a blameless man at arms; then sent to endless shade"
300,10,409,"Thoon and Eunomus; and strook the strong Chersidamas,"
300,10,410,"As from his chariot he leap’d down, beneath his targe of brass;"
300,10,411,"Who fell, and crawl’d upon the earth with his sustaining palms,"
300,10,412,"And left the fight. Nor yet his lance left dealing martial alms,"
300,10,413,"But Socus’ brother by both sides, young Carops, did impress."
300,10,414,"Then princely Socus to his aid made brotherly access,"
300,10,415,"And, coming near, spake in his charge: “O great Laertes’ son,"
300,10,416,"Insatiate in sly stratagems, and labours never done,"
300,10,417,"This hour, or thou shalt boast to kill the two Hippasides"
300,10,418,"And prise their arms, or fall thyself in my resolv’d access.”"
300,10,419,"This said, he threw quite through his shield his fell and well - driv’n"
300,10,420,"lance,"
300,10,421,"Which held way through his curaces, and on his ribs did glance,"
300,10,422,Plowing the flesh alongst his sides; but Pallas did repel
300,10,423,"All inward passage to his life. Ulysses, knowing well"
300,10,424,The wound undeadly (setting back his foot to form his stand)
300,10,425,"Thus spake to Socus: “O thou wretch, thy death is in this hand,"
300,10,426,"That stay’st my victory on Troy, and where thy charge was made"
300,10,427,In doubtful terms (or this or that) this shall thy life invade.”
300,10,428,"This frighted Socus to retreat, and, in his faint reverse,"
300,10,429,"The lance betwixt his shoulders fell, and through his breast did perse,"
300,10,430,"Down fell he sounding, and the king thus play’d with his mis - ease:"
300,10,431,"“O Socus, you that make by birth the two Hippasides,"
300,10,432,Now may your house and you perceive death can outfly the flyer.
300,10,433,"Ah wretch! thou canst not ’scape my vows. Old Hippasus thy sire,"
300,10,434,"Nor thy well - honour’d mother’s hands, in both which lies thy worth,"
300,10,435,"Shall close thy wretched eyes in death, but vultures dig them forth,"
300,10,436,"And hide them with their darksome wings; but when Ulysses dies,"
300,10,437,Divinest Greeks shall tomb my corse with all their obsequies.”
300,10,438,"Now from his body and his shield the violent lance he drew,"
300,10,439,"That princely Socus had infix’d; which drawn, a crimson dew"
300,10,440,Fell from his bosom on the earth; the wound did dare him sore.
300,10,441,"And when the furious Trojans saw Ulysses’ forcéd gore,"
300,10,442,"Encouraging themselves in gross, all his destruction vow’d."
300,10,443,"Then he retir’d, and summon’d aid. Thrice shouted he aloud,"
300,10,444,As did denote a man engag’d. Thrice Menelaus’ ear
300,10,445,"Observ’d his aid - suggesting voice, and Ajax being near,"
300,10,446,"He told him of Ulysses’ shouts, as if he were enclos’d"
300,10,447,"From all assistance, and advis’d their aids might be dispos’d"
300,10,448,"Against the ring that circled him, lest, charg’d with troops alone,"
300,10,449,"(Though valiant) he might be oppress’d, whom Greece so built upon."
300,10,450,"He led, and Ajax seconded. They found their Jove - lov’d king"
300,10,451,Circled with foes. As when a den of bloody lucerns cling
300,10,452,"About a goodly - palméd hart, hurt with a hunter’s bow,"
300,10,453,"Whose ’scape his nimble feet enforce, whilst his warm blood doth flow,"
300,10,454,"And his light knees have pow’r to move; but, master’d of his wound,"
300,10,455,"Emboss’d within a shady hill, the lucerns charge him round,"
300,10,456,And tear his flesh; when instantly fortune sends in the pow’rs
300,10,457,"Of some stern lion, with whose sight they fly, and he devours;"
300,10,458,"So charged the Ilians Ithacus, many and mighty men."
300,10,459,"But then made Menelaus in, and horrid Ajax then,"
300,10,460,"Bearing a target like a tow’r, close was his violent stand,"
300,10,461,"And every way the foe dispers’d, when, by the royal hand,"
300,10,462,"Kind Menelaus led away the hurt Laertes’ son,"
300,10,463,Till his fair squire had brought his horse. Victorious Telamon
300,10,464,"Still plied the foe, and put to sword a young Priamides,"
300,10,465,"Doryclus, Priam’s bastard son; then did his lance impress"
300,10,466,"Pandocus, and strong Pirasus, Lysander and Palertes."
300,10,467,"As when a torrent from the hills, swoln with Saturnian show’rs,"
300,10,468,"Falls on the fields, bears blasted oaks, and wither’d rosin flow’rs,"
300,10,469,"Loose weeds, and all disperséd filth, into the ocean’s force;"
300,10,470,"So matchless Ajax beat the field, and slaughter’d men and horse."
300,10,471,"Yet had not Hector heard of this, who fought on the left wing"
300,10,472,"Of all the host, near those sweet herbs Scamander’s flood doth spring,"
300,10,473,"Where many foreheads trod the ground, and where the skirmish burn’d"
300,10,474,"Near Nestor and king Idomen, where Hector over turn’d"
300,10,475,"The Grecian squadrons, authoring high service with his lance,"
300,10,476,And skilful manage of his horse. Nor yet the discrepance
300,10,477,"He made in death betwixt the hosts had made the Greeks retire,"
300,10,478,If fair - hair’d Helen’s second spouse had not repress’d the fire
300,10,479,"Of bold Machaon’s fortitude, who with a three - fork’d head"
300,10,480,In his right shoulder wounded him. Then had the Grecians dread.
300,10,481,"Lest, in his strength declin’d, the foe should slaughter their hurt"
300,10,482,friend.
300,10,483,"Then Crete’s king urg’d Neleides his chariot to ascend,"
300,10,484,"And getting near him, take him in, and bear him to their tents."
300,10,485,"A surgeon is to be preferr’d, with physic ornaments,"
300,10,486,"Before a multitude; his life gives hurt lives native bounds,"
300,10,487,"With sweet inspersion of fit balms, and perfect search of wounds."
300,10,488,"Thus spake the royal Idomen. Neleides obey’d,"
300,10,489,"And to his chariot presently the wounded Greek convey’d,"
300,10,490,"The son of Æsculapius, the great physician."
300,10,491,To fleet they flew. Cebriones perceiv’d the slaughter done
300,10,492,"By Ajax on the other troops, and spake to Hector thus:"
300,10,493,"“Whiles we encounter Grecians here, stern Telamonius"
300,10,494,"Is yonder raging, turning up in heaps our horse and men;"
300,10,495,"I know him by his spacious shield. Let us turn chariot then,"
300,10,496,"Where, both of horse and foot, the fight most hotly is propos’d,"
300,10,497,"In mutual slaughters. Hark, their throats from cries are never clos’d.”"
300,10,498,"This said, with his shrill scourge he strook the horse, that fast"
300,10,499,ensu’d
300,10,500,"Stung with his lashes, tossing shields, and carcasses imbru’d."
300,10,501,"The chariot tree was drown’d in blood, and th’ arches by the seat"
300,10,502,"Disperpled from the horses’ hoofs, and from the wheel bands beat."
300,10,503,"Great Hector long’d to break the ranks, and startle their close fight,"
300,10,504,"Who horribly amaz’d the Greeks, and plied their sudden fright"
300,10,505,"With busy weapons, ever wing’d; his lance, sword, weighty stones."
300,10,506,"Yet charg’d he other leader’s hands, not dreadful Telamon’s;"
300,10,507,With whom he wisely shunn’d foul blows. But Jove (that weighs above
300,10,508,"All human pow’rs) to Ajax’ breast divine repressions drove,"
300,10,509,"And made him shun who shunn’d himself; he ceas’d from fight amaz’d,"
300,10,510,"Cast on his back his sev’n - fold shield, and round about him gaz’d"
300,10,511,"Like one turn’d wild, look’d on himself in his distract retreat,"
300,10,512,"Knee before knee did scarcely move. As when from herds of neat,"
300,10,513,"Whole threaves of boors and mongrels chase a lion skulking near,"
300,10,514,"Loth he should taint the well - prized fat of any stall - fed steer,"
300,10,515,"Consuming all the night in watch, he, greedy of his prey,"
300,10,516,"Oft thrusting on is oft thrust off, so thick the jav’lins play"
300,10,517,"On his bold charges, and so hot the burning fire - brands shine,"
300,10,518,"Which he (though horrible) abhors, about his glowing eyne,"
300,10,519,"And early his great heart retires; so Ajax from the foe,"
300,10,520,"For fear their fleet should be inflam’d, ’gainst his swoln heart did"
300,10,521,go.
300,10,522,"As when a dull mill ass comes near a goodly field of corn,"
300,10,523,"Kept from the birds by children’s cries, the boys are overborne"
300,10,524,"By his insensible approach, and simply he will eat;"
300,10,525,"About whom many wands are broke, and still the children beat,"
300,10,526,"And still the self - providing ass doth with their weakness bear,"
300,10,527,"Not stirring till his paunch be full, and scarcely then will steer;"
300,10,528,"So the huge son of Telamon amongst the Trojans far’d,"
300,10,529,"Bore show’rs of darts upon his shield, yet scorn’d to fly as scar’d,"
300,10,530,And so kept softly on his way; nor would he mend his pace
300,10,531,"For all their violent pursuits, that still did arm the chace"
300,10,532,"With singing lances. But, at last, when their cur - like presumes"
300,10,533,"More urg’d the more forborne, his spirits did rarify their fumes,"
300,10,534,"And he revok’d his active strength, turn’d head, and did repell"
300,10,535,"The horse - troops that were new made in, ’twixt whom the fight grew"
300,10,536,fell;
300,10,537,"And by degrees he stole retreat, yet with such puissant stay"
300,10,538,That none could pass him to the fleet. In both the armies’ sway
300,10,539,"He stood, and from strong hands receiv’d sharp jav’lins on his shield,"
300,10,540,"Where many stuck, thrown on before, many fell short in field,"
300,10,541,"Ere the white body they could reach, and stuck, as telling how"
300,10,542,They purpos’d to have pierc’d his flesh. His peril piercéd now
300,10,543,"The eyes of prince Eurypylus, Evemon’s famous son,"
300,10,544,"Who came close on, and with his dart strook duke Apisaon,"
300,10,545,"Whose surname was Phausiades, ev’n to the concrete blood"
300,10,546,"That makes the liver; on the earth, out gush’d his vital flood."
300,10,547,"Eurypylus made in, and eas’d his shoulders of his arms;"
300,10,548,"Which Paris seeing, he drew his bow, and wreak’d in part the harms"
300,10,549,"Of his good friend Phausiades, his arrow he let fly"
300,10,550,"That smote Eurypylus, and brake in his attainted thigh;"
300,10,551,"Then took he troop to shun black death, and to the flyers cried:"
300,10,552,"“Princes, and leaders of the Greeks, stand, and repulse the tide"
300,10,553,"Of this our honour - wracking chace. Ajax is drown’d in darts,"
300,10,554,"I fear past ’scape; turn, honour’d friends, help out his vent’rous"
300,10,555,parts.”
300,10,556,Thus spake the wounded Greek; the sound cast on their backs their
300,10,557,"shields,"
300,10,558,And rais’d their darts; to whose relief Ajax his person wields.
300,10,559,"Then stood he firmly with his friends, retiring their retire."
300,10,560,"And thus both hosts indiff’rent join’d, the fight grew hot as fire."
300,10,561,"Now had Neleides’ sweating steeds brought him, and his hurt friend,"
300,10,562,"Amongst their fleet. Æacides, that wishly did intend,"
300,10,563,"Standing astern his tall - neck’d ship, how deep the skirmish drew"
300,10,564,"Amongst the Greeks, and with what ruth the insecution grew,"
300,10,565,"Saw Nestor bring Machaon hurt, and from within did call"
300,10,566,"His friend Patroclus; who, like Mars in form celestial,"
300,10,567,"Came forth with first sound of his voice, first spring of his decay,"
300,10,568,"And ask’d his princely friend’s desire. “Dear friend,” said he, “this"
300,10,569,day
300,10,570,"I doubt not will enforce the Greeks, to swarm about my knees;"
300,10,571,I see unsuffer’d need employ’d in their extremities.
300,10,572,"Go, sweet Patroclus, and inquire of old Neleides"
300,10,573,Whom he brought wounded from the fight; by his back parts I guess
300,10,574,"It is Machaon, but his face I could not well descry,"
300,10,575,They pass’d me in such earnest speed.” Patroclus presently
300,10,576,"Obey’d his friend, and ran to know. They now descended were,"
300,10,577,"And Nestor’s squire, Eurymedon, the horses did ungear;"
300,10,578,"Themselves stood near th’ extremest shore, to let the gentle air"
300,10,579,Dry up their sweat; then to the tent where Hecamed the fair
300,10,580,"Set chairs, and for the wounded prince a potion did prepare."
300,10,581,"This Hecamed, by war’s hard fate, fell to old Nestor’s share,"
300,10,582,When Thetis’ son sack’d Tenedos; she was the princely seed
300,10,583,"Of worthy king Arsinous, and by the Greeks decreed"
300,10,584,"The prise of Nestor, since all men in counsel he surpass’d."
300,10,585,"First, a fair table she appos’d, of which the feet were grac’d"
300,10,586,With bluish metal mix’d with black; and on the same she put
300,10,587,"A brass fruit - dish, in which she serv’d a wholesome onion cut"
300,10,588,"For pittance to the potion, and honey newly wrought,"
300,10,589,"And bread, the fruit of sacred meal. Then to the board she brought"
300,10,590,"A right fair cup with gold studs driv’n, which Nestor did transfer"
300,10,591,"From Pylos; on whose swelling sides four handles fixéd were,"
300,10,592,"And upon ev’ry handle sat a pair of doves of gold,"
300,10,593,"Some billing, and some pecking meat; two gilt feet did uphold"
300,10,594,The antique body; and withal so weighty was the cup
300,10,595,"That, being propos’d brimful of wine, one scarce could lift it up,"
300,10,596,"Yet Nestor drunk in it with ease, spite of his years’ respect."
300,10,597,In this the goddess - like fair dame a potion did confect
300,10,598,"With good old wine of Pramnius, and scrap’d into the wine"
300,10,599,"Cheese made of goat’s milk, and on it spers’d flour exceeding fine."
300,10,600,"In this sort for the wounded lord the potion she prepar’d,"
300,10,601,"And bad him drink. For company, with him old Nestor shar’d."
300,10,602,"Thus physically quench’d they thirst, and then their spirits reviv’d"
300,10,603,"With pleasant conference. And now Patroclus, being arriv’d,"
300,10,604,"Made stay at th’ entry of the tent. Old Nestor, seeing it,"
300,10,605,"Rose, and receiv’d him by the hand, and fain would have him sit."
300,10,606,"He set that courtesy aside, excusing it with haste,"
300,10,607,"Since his much - to - be - rev’renced friend sent him to know who past,"
300,10,608,"Wounded with him in chariot, so swiftly through the shore;"
300,10,609,"“Whom now,” said he, “I see and know, and now can stay no more;"
300,10,610,"You know, good father, our great friend is apt to take offence,"
300,10,611,Whose fi’ry temper will inflame sometimes with innocence.”
300,10,612,He answer’d: “When will Peleus’ son some royal pity show
300,10,613,On his thus wounded countrymen? Ah! is he yet to know
300,10,614,"How much affliction tires our host? How our especial aid,"
300,10,615,"Tainted with lances, at their tents are miserably laid?"
300,10,616,"Ulysses, Diomed, our king, Eurypylus, Machaon,"
300,10,617,"All hurt, and all our worthiest friends; yet no compassion"
300,10,618,Can supple thy friend’s friendless breast! Doth he reserve his eye
300,10,619,"Till our fleet burn, and we ourselves one after other die?"
300,10,620,"Alas, my forces are not now as in my younger life."
300,10,621,Oh would to God I had that strength I uséd in the strife
300,10,622,"Betwixt us and the Elians, for oxen to be driv’n,"
300,10,623,When Itymonius’ lofty soul was by my valour giv’n
300,10,624,"As sacrifice to destiny, Hypirochus’ strong son,"
300,10,625,"That dwelt in Elis, and fought first in our contention!"
300,10,626,"We forag’d, as proclaiméd foes, a wondrous wealthy boot,"
300,10,627,"And he, in rescue of his herds, fell breathless at my foot."
300,10,628,All the dorp boors with terror fled. Our prey was rich and great;
300,10,629,Twice five and twenty flocks of sheep; as many herds of neat;
300,10,630,"As many goats, and nasty swine; an hundred fifty mares,"
300,10,631,"All sorrel, most with sucking foals. And these soon - monied wares"
300,10,632,"We drave into Neleius’ town, fair Pylos, all by night."
300,10,633,My father’s heart was glad to see so much good fortune quite
300,10,634,"The forward mind of his young son, that us’d my youth in deeds,"
300,10,635,And would not smother it in moods. Now drew the Sun’s bright steeds
300,10,636,Light from the hills; our heralds now accited all that were
300,10,637,Endamag’d by the Elians; our princes did appear;
300,10,638,"Our boot was parted; many men th’ Epeians much did owe,"
300,10,639,"That, being our neighbours, they did spoil; afflictions did so flow"
300,10,640,"On us poor Pylians, though but few. In brake great Hercules"
300,10,641,"To our sad confines of late years, and wholly did suppress"
300,10,642,"Our hapless princes. Twice - six Sons renown’d Neleius bred,"
300,10,643,"Only myself am left of all, the rest subdu’d and dead."
300,10,644,"And this was it that made so proud the base Epeian bands,"
300,10,645,"On their near neighbours, being oppress’d, to lay injurious hands."
300,10,646,"A herd of oxen for himself, a mighty flock of sheep,"
300,10,647,"My sire selected, and made choice of shepherds for their keep;"
300,10,648,And from the gen’ral spoil he cull’d three hundred of the best.
300,10,649,"The Elians ought him infinite, most plagu’d of all the rest."
300,10,650,"Four wager - winning horse he lost, and chariots intervented,"
300,10,651,Being led to an appointed race; the prize that was presented
300,10,652,Was a religious three - foot urn; Augeas was the king
300,10,653,"That did detain them, and dismiss’d their keeper sorrowing"
300,10,654,For his lov’d charge lost with foul words. Then both for words and
300,10,655,deeds
300,10,656,"My sire being worthily incens’d, thus justly he proceeds"
300,10,657,"To satisfaction, in first choice of all our wealthy prise;"
300,10,658,"And, as he shar’d much, much he left his subjects to suffice,"
300,10,659,"That none might be oppress’d with pow’r, or want his portion due."
300,10,660,Thus for the public good we shar’d. Then we to temples drew
300,10,661,"Our cómplete city, and to heav’n we thankful rites did burn"
300,10,662,For our rich conquest. The third day ensuing our return
300,10,663,The Elians flew on us in heaps; their gen’ral leaders were
300,10,664,"The two Moliones, two boys, untrainéd in the fear"
300,10,665,"Of horrid war, or use of strength. A certain city shines"
300,10,666,"Upon a lofty prominent, and in th’ extreme confines"
300,10,667,"Of sandy Pylos, seated where Alpheus’ flood doth run,"
300,10,668,"And call’d Thryessa; this they sieg’d, and gladly would have won,"
300,10,669,"But, having pass’d through all our fields, Minerva as our spy"
300,10,670,"Fell from Olympus in the night, and arm’d us instantly;"
300,10,671,"Nor muster’d she unwilling men, nor unprepar’d for force."
300,10,672,"My sire yet would not let me arm, but hid away my horse,"
300,10,673,Esteeming me no soldier yet; yet shin’d I nothing less
300,10,674,"Amongst our gallants, though on foot; Minerva’s mightiness"
300,10,675,"Led me to fight, and made me bear a soldier’s worthy name."
300,10,676,"There is a flood falls into sea, and his crook’d course doth frame"
300,10,677,"Close to Arena, and is call’d bright Minyæus’ stream."
300,10,678,"There made we halt, and there the sun cast many a glorious beam"
300,10,679,"On our bright armours, horse and foot insea’d together there."
300,10,680,Then march’d we on. By fi’ry noon we saw the sacred clear
300,10,681,"Of great Alpheus, where to Jove we did fair sacrifice;"
300,10,682,"And to the azure God, that rules the under - liquid skies,"
300,10,683,We offer’d up a solemn bull; a bull t’ Alpheus’ name;
300,10,684,And to the blue - ey’d Maid we burn’d a heifer never tame.
300,10,685,"Now was it night; we supp’d and slept, about the flood, in arms."
300,10,686,"The foe laid hard siege to our town, and shook it with alarms,"
300,10,687,"But, for prevention of their spleens, a mighty work of war"
300,10,688,Appear’d behind them; for as soon as Phœbus’ fi’ry car
300,10,689,"Cast night’s foul darkness from his wheels (invoking rev’rend Jove,"
300,10,690,"And the unconquer’d Maid his birth) we did th’ event approve,"
300,10,691,"And gave them battle. First of all, I slew (the army saw)"
300,10,692,"The mighty soldier Mulius, Augeas’ son - in - law,"
300,10,693,And spoil’d him of his one hoof’d horse; his eldest daughter was
300,10,694,"Bright Agamede, that for skill in simples did surpass,"
300,10,695,"And knew as many kind of drugs, as earth’s broad centre bred."
300,10,696,"Him charg’d I with my brass - arm’d lance, the dust receiv’d him dead."
300,10,697,"I, leaping to his chariot, amongst the foremost press’d,"
300,10,698,"And the great - hearted Elians fled frighted, seeing their best"
300,10,699,"And loftiest soldier taken down, the gen’ral of their horse."
300,10,700,"I follow’d like a black whirlwind, and did for prise enforce"
300,10,701,"Full fifty chariots, ev’ry one furnish’d with two arm’d men,"
300,10,702,"Who ate the earth, slain with my lance. And I had slaughter’d then"
300,10,703,"The two young boys, Moliones, if their world - circling sire,"
300,10,704,"Great Neptune, had not saft their lives, and cover’d their retire"
300,10,705,With unpierc’d clouds. Then Jove bestow’d a haughty victory
300,10,706,"Upon us Pylians; for so long we did the chace apply,"
300,10,707,"Slaught’ring and making spoil of arms, till sweet Buprasius’ soil,"
300,10,708,"Alesius, and Olenia, were fam’d with our recoil;"
300,10,709,"For there Minerva turn’d our pow’r, and there the last I slew"
300,10,710,"As, when our battle join’d, the first. The Pylians then withdrew"
300,10,711,"To Pylas from Buprasius. Of all th’ Immortals then,"
300,10,712,They most thank’d Jove for victory; Nestor the most of men.
300,10,713,"Such was I ever, if I were employ’d with other peers,"
300,10,714,"And I had honour of my youth, which dies not in my years."
300,10,715,And great Achilles only joys hability of act
300,10,716,"In his brave prime, and doth not deign t’ impart it where ’tis lack’d."
300,10,717,"No doubt he will extremely mourn, long after that black hour"
300,10,718,"Wherein our ruin shall be brought, and rue his ruthless pow’r,"
300,10,719,O friend! my memory revives the charge Menœtius gave
300,10,720,"Thy towardness, when thou sett’st forth, to keep out of the grave"
300,10,721,Our wounded honour. I myself and wise Ulysses were
300,10,722,"Within the room, where ev’ry word then spoken we did hear,"
300,10,723,"For we were come to Peleus’ court, as we did must’ring pass"
300,10,724,"Through rich Achaia, where thy sire, Menœtius, was,"
300,10,725,"Thyself and great Æacides, when Peleüs the king"
300,10,726,"To thunder - loving Jove did burn an ox for offering,"
300,10,727,"In his court - yard. A cup of gold, crown’d with red wine, he held"
300,10,728,"On th’ holy incensory pour’d. You, when the ox was fell’d,"
300,10,729,Were dressing his divided limbs; we in the portal stood.
300,10,730,"Achilles seeing us come so near, his honourable blood"
300,10,731,"Was strook with a respective shame, rose, took us by the hands,"
300,10,732,"Brought us both in, and made us sit, and us’d his kind commands"
300,10,733,"For seemly hospitable rites, which quickly were appos’d."
300,10,734,"Then, after needfulness of food, I first of all disclos’d"
300,10,735,The royal cause of our repair; mov’d you and your great friend
300,10,736,To consort our renown’d designs; both straight did condescend.
300,10,737,"Your fathers knew it, gave consent, and grave instruction"
300,10,738,To both your valours. Peleus charg’d his most unequall’d son
300,10,739,"To govern his victorious strength, and shine past all the rest"
300,10,740,"In honour, as in mere main force. Then were thy partings blest"
300,10,741,"With dear advices from thy sire; ‘My lovéd son,’ said he,"
300,10,742,"‘Achilles, by his grace of birth, superior is to thee,"
300,10,743,"And for his force more excellent, yet thou more ripe in years;"
300,10,744,"Then with sound counsels, age’s fruits, employ his honour’d years,"
300,10,745,Command and overrule his moods; his nature will obey
300,10,746,"In any charge discreetly giv’n, that doth his good assay.’"
300,10,747,"“Thus charg’d thy sire, which thou forgett’st. Yet now at last approve,"
300,10,748,"With forcéd reference of these, th’ attraction of his love;"
300,10,749,"Who knows if sacred influence may bless thy good intent,"
300,10,750,"And enter with thy gracious words, ev’n to his full consent?"
300,10,751,The admonition of a friend is sweet and vehement.
300,10,752,"If any oracle he shun, or if his mother - queen"
300,10,753,"Hath brought him some instinct from Jove, that fortifies his spleen,"
300,10,754,"Let him resign command to thee of all his Myrmidons,"
300,10,755,"And yield by that means some repulse to our confusions,"
300,10,756,"Adorning thee in his bright arms, that his resembled form"
300,10,757,"May haply make thee thought himself, and calm this hostile storm;"
300,10,758,"That so a little we may ease our overchargéd hands,"
300,10,759,"Draw some breath, not expire it all. The foe but faintly stands"
300,10,760,"Beneath his labours; and your charge being fierce, and freshly giv’n,"
300,10,761,They eas’ly from our tents and fleet may to their walls be driv’n.”
300,10,762,This mov’d the good Patroclus’ mind; who made his utmost haste
300,10,763,"T’ inform his friend; and as the fleet of Ithacus he past,"
300,10,764,"(At which their markets were dispos’d, councils, and martial courts,"
300,10,765,And where to th’ altars of the Gods they made divine resorts)
300,10,766,"He met renown’d Eurypylus, Evemon’s noble son,"
300,10,767,"Halting, his thigh hurt with a shaft, the liquid sweat did run"
300,10,768,"Down from his shoulders and his brows, and from his raging wound"
300,10,769,"Forth flow’d his melancholy blood, yet still his mind was sound."
300,10,770,"His sight in kind Patroclus’ breast to sacred pity turn’d,"
300,10,771,And (nothing more immartial for true ruth) thus he mourn’d:
300,10,772,"“Ah wretched progeny of Greece, princes, dejected kings,"
300,10,773,"Was it your fates to nourish beasts, and serve the outcast wings"
300,10,774,"Of savage vultures here in Troy? Tell me, Evemon’s fame,"
300,10,775,"Do yet the Greeks withstand his force, whom yet no force can tame?"
300,10,776,Or are they hopeless thrown to death by his resistless lance?”
300,10,777,"“Divine Patroclus,” he replied, “no more can Greece advance"
300,10,778,"Defensive weapons, but to fleet they headlong must retire,"
300,10,779,"For those that to this hour have held our fleet from hostile fire,"
300,10,780,"And are the bulwarks of our host, lie wounded at their tents,"
300,10,781,"And Troy’s unvanquishable pow’r, still as it toils augments."
300,10,782,"But take me to thy black - stern’d ship, save me, and from my thigh"
300,10,783,"Cut out this arrow, and the blood, that is ingor’d and dry,"
300,10,784,"Wash with warm water from the wound; then gentle salves apply,"
300,10,785,"Which thou know’st best, thy princely friend hath taught thee surgery,"
300,10,786,"Whom, of all Centaurs the most just, Chiron did institute."
300,10,787,"Thus to thy honourable hands my ease I prosecute,"
300,10,788,Since our physicians cannot help. Machaon at his tent
300,10,789,"Needs a physician himself, being leech and patient;"
300,10,790,"And Podalirius, in the field, the sharp conflict sustains.”"
300,10,791,Strong Menœtiades replied: “How shall I ease thy pains?
300,10,792,"What shall we do, Eurypylus? I am to use all haste,"
300,10,793,"To signify to Thetis’ son occurrents that have past,"
300,10,794,At Nestor’s honourable suit. But be that work achiev’d
300,10,795,"When this is done, I will not leave thy torments unrelieved.”"
300,10,796,"This said, athwart his back he cast, beneath his breast, his arm,"
300,10,797,"And nobly help’d him to his tent. His servants, seeing his harm,"
300,10,798,"Dispread ox - hides upon the earth, whereon Machaon lay."
300,10,799,"Patroclus cut out the sharp shaft, and clearly wash’d away"
300,10,800,With lukewarm water the black blood; then ’twixt his hands he bruis’d
300,10,801,A sharp and mitigatory root; which when he had infus’d
300,10,802,"Into the green, well - cleansed, wound, the pains he felt before"
300,10,803,"Were well, and instantly allay’d; the wound did bleed no more."
300,10,804,THE END OF THE ELEVENTH BOOK.
300,11,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,11,2,"The Trojans at the trench their pow’rs engage,"
300,11,3,Though greeted by a bird of bad presage.
300,11,4,"In five parts they divide their pow’r to scale,"
300,11,5,And Prince Sarpedon forceth down the pale.
300,11,6,"Great Hector from the ports tears out a stone,"
300,11,7,And with so dead a strength he sets it gone
300,11,8,At those broad gates the Grecians made to guard
300,11,9,"Their tents and ships, that, broken, and unbarr’d,"
300,11,10,They yield way to his pow’r; when all contend
300,11,11,To reach the ships; which all at last ascend.
300,11,12,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,11,13,"Μy works the Trojans all the grace,"
300,11,14,And doth the Grecian fort deface.
300,11,15,"Patroclus thus employ’d in cure of hurt Eurypylus,"
300,11,16,"Both hosts are all for other wounds doubly contentious,"
300,11,17,"One always labouring to expel, the other to invade."
300,11,18,"Nor could the broad dike of the Greeks, or that strong wall they made"
300,11,19,"To guard their fleet, be long unras’d; because it was not rais’d"
300,11,20,"By grave direction of the Gods, nor were their Deities prais’d"
300,11,21,"(When they begun) with hecatombs, that then they might be sure"
300,11,22,"(Their strength being season’d well with heav’n’s) it should have force t’ endure,"
300,11,23,"And so, the safeguard of their fleet, and all their treasure there,"
300,11,24,"Infallibly had been confirm’d; when, now, their bulwarks were"
300,11,25,Not only without pow’r of check to their assaulting foe
300,11,26,"(Ev’n now, as soon as they were built) but apt to overthrow;"
300,11,27,"Such as, in very little time, shall bury all their sight"
300,11,28,And thought that ever they were made. As long as the despite
300,11,29,"Of great Æacides held up, and Hector went not down,"
300,11,30,"And that by those two means stood safe king Priam’s sacred town,"
300,11,31,"So long their rampire had some use, though now it gave some way;"
300,11,32,"But when Troy’s best men suffer’d fate, and many Greeks did pay"
300,11,33,"Dear for their suff’rance, then the rest home to their country turn’d,"
300,11,34,"The tenth year of their wars at Troy, and Troy was sack’d and burn’d."
300,11,35,And then the Gods fell to their fort; then they their pow’rs employ
300,11,36,"To ruin their work, and left less of that than they of Troy."
300,11,37,"Neptune and Phœbus tumbled down, from the Idalian hills,"
300,11,38,"An inundation of all floods, that thence the broad sea fills"
300,11,39,"On their huge rampire; in one glut, all these together roar’d,"
300,11,40,"Rhesus, Heptaporus, Rhodius, Scamander the ador’d,"
300,11,41,"Caresus, Simois, Grenicus, Æsepus; of them all"
300,11,42,"Apollo open’d the rough mouths, and made their lusty fall"
300,11,43,"Ravish the dusty champian, where many a helm and shield,"
300,11,44,"And half - god race of men, were strew’d. And, that all these might yield"
300,11,45,"Full tribute to the heav’nly work, Neptune and Phœbus won"
300,11,46,"Jove to unburthen the black wombs of clouds, fill’d by the sun,"
300,11,47,"And pour them into all their streams, that quickly they might send"
300,11,48,The huge wall swimming to the sea. Nine days their lights did spend
300,11,49,"To nights in tempests; and when all their utmost depth had made,"
300,11,50,"Jove, Phœbus, Neptune, all came down, and all in state did wade"
300,11,51,"To ruin of that impious fort. Great Neptune went before,"
300,11,52,"Wrought with his trident, and the stones, trunks, roots of trees, he tore"
300,11,53,"Out of the rampire, toss’d them all into the Hellespont,"
300,11,54,"Ev’n all the proud toil of the Greeks, with which they durst confront"
300,11,55,"The to - be shunnéd Deities, and not a stone remain’d"
300,11,56,"Of all their huge foundations, all with the earth were plain’d."
300,11,57,"Which done, again the Gods turn’d back the silver - flowing floods"
300,11,58,"By that vast channel, through whose vaults they pour’d abroad their broods,"
300,11,59,And cover’d all the ample shore again with dusty sand.
300,11,60,"And this the end was of that wall, where now so many a hand"
300,11,61,"Was emptied of stones and darts, contending to invade;"
300,11,62,Where Clamour spent so high a throat; and where the fell blows made
300,11,63,"The new - built wooden turrets groan. And here the Greeks were pent,"
300,11,64,"Tam’d with the iron whip of Jove, that terrors vehement"
300,11,65,"Shook over them by Hector’s hand, who was in ev’ry thought"
300,11,66,"The terror - master of the field, and like a whirlwind fought,"
300,11,67,"As fresh as in his morn’s first charge. And as a savage boar,"
300,11,68,"Or lion, hunted long, at last, with hounds’ and hunters’ store"
300,11,69,"Is compass’d round; they charge him close, and stand (as in a tow’r"
300,11,70,They had inchas’d him) pouring on of darts an iron show’r;
300,11,71,"His glorious heart yet nought appall’d, and forcing forth his way,"
300,11,72,"Here overthrows a troop, and there a running ring doth stay"
300,11,73,"His utter passage; when, again, that stay he overthrows,"
300,11,74,"And then the whole field frees his rage; so Hector wearies blows,"
300,11,75,"Runs out his charge upon the fort, and all his force would force"
300,11,76,"To pass the dike; which, being so deep, they could not get their horse"
300,11,77,"To venture on, but trample, snore, and on the very brink"
300,11,78,"To neigh with spirit, yet still stand off. Nor would a human think"
300,11,79,"The passage safe; or, if it were, ’twas less safe for retreat;"
300,11,80,"The dike being ev’rywhere so deep, and, where ’twas least deep, set"
300,11,81,"With stakes exceeding thick, sharp, strong, that horse could never"
300,11,82,"pass,"
300,11,83,Much less their chariots after them; yet for the foot there was
300,11,84,"Some hopeful service, which they wish’d. Polydamas then spake:"
300,11,85,"“Hector, and all our friends of Troy, we indiscreetly make"
300,11,86,"Offer of passage with our horse; ye see the stakes, the wall,"
300,11,87,"Impossible for horse to take; nor can men fight at all,"
300,11,88,"The place being strait, and much more apt to let us take our bane"
300,11,89,"Than give the enemy. And yet, if Jove decree the wane"
300,11,90,"Of Grecian glory utterly, and so bereave their hearts"
300,11,91,"That we may freely charge them thus, and then will take our parts,"
300,11,92,"I would with all speed wish th’ assault, that ugly shame might shed"
300,11,93,"(Thus far from home) these Grecians’ bloods. But, if they once turn"
300,11,94,head
300,11,95,"And sally on us from their fleet, when in so deep a dike"
300,11,96,"We shall lie struggling, not a man of all our host is like"
300,11,97,To live and carry back the news. And therefore be it thus:
300,11,98,"Here leave we horse kept by our men, and all on foot let us"
300,11,99,"Hold close together, and attend the grace of Hector’s guide,"
300,11,100,"And then they shall not bear our charge, our conquest shall be dyed"
300,11,101,"In their lives’ purples.” This advice pleas’d Hector, for ’twas sound;"
300,11,102,"Who first obey’d it, and full - arm’d betook him to the ground."
300,11,103,"And then all left their chariots when he was seen to lead,"
300,11,104,"Rushing about him, and gave up each chariot and steed"
300,11,105,"To their directors to be kept, in all procinct of war,"
300,11,106,"There, and on that side of the dike. And thus the rest prepare"
300,11,107,"Their onset: In five regiments they all their pow’r divide,"
300,11,108,Each regiment allow’d three chiefs. Of all which ev’n the pride
300,11,109,Serv’d in great Hector’s regiment; for all were set on fire
300,11,110,(Their passage beaten through the wall) with hazardous desire
300,11,111,That they might once but fight at fleet. With Hector captains were
300,11,112,"Polydamas, and Cebriones, who was his charioteer;"
300,11,113,But Hector found that place a worse. Chiefs of the second band
300,11,114,"Were Paris and Alcathous, Agenor. The command"
300,11,115,"The third strong phalanx had, was giv’n to th’ augur Helenus,"
300,11,116,"Deiphobus, that god - like man, and mighty Asius,"
300,11,117,"Ev’n Asius Hyrtacides, that from Arisba rode"
300,11,118,"The huge bay horse, and had his house where river Selleës flow’d."
300,11,119,"The fourth charge good Æneas led, and with him were combin’d"
300,11,120,"Archelochus, and Acamas, Antenor’s dearest kind,"
300,11,121,And excellent at ev’ry fight. The fifth brave company
300,11,122,"Sarpedon had to charge, who choos’d, for his command’s supply,"
300,11,123,"Asteropseus great in arms, and Glaucus; for both these"
300,11,124,"Were best of all men but himself, but he was fellowless."
300,11,125,"Thus fitted with their well - wrought shields, down the steep dike they"
300,11,126,"go,"
300,11,127,"And (thirsty of the wall’s assault) believe in overthrow,"
300,11,128,Not doubting but with headlong falls to tumble down the Greeks
300,11,129,"From their black navy. In which trust, all on; and no man seeks"
300,11,130,"To cross Polydamas’ advice with any other course,"
300,11,131,"But Asius Hyrtacides, who (proud of his bay horse)"
300,11,132,"Would not forsake them, nor his man, that was their manager,"
300,11,133,"(Fool that he was) but all to fleet, and little knew how near"
300,11,134,"An ill death sat him, and a sure, and that he never more"
300,11,135,"Must look on lofty Ilion; but looks, and all, before,"
300,11,136,"Put on th’ all - cov’ring mist of fate, that then did hang upon"
300,11,137,The lance of great Deucalides; he fatally rush’d on
300,11,138,"The left hand way, by which the Greeks, with horse and chariot,"
300,11,139,"Came usually from field to fleet; close to the gates he got,"
300,11,140,"Which both unbarr’d and ope he found, that so the easier might"
300,11,141,An entry be for any friend that was behind in flight;
300,11,142,"Yet not much easier for a foe, because there was a guard"
300,11,143,"Maintain’d upon it, past his thought; who still put for it hard,"
300,11,144,"Eagerly shouting; and with him were five more friends of name,"
300,11,145,"That would not leave him, though none else would hunt that way for fame"
300,11,146,"(In their free choice) but he himself. Orestes, Iamenus,"
300,11,147,"And Acamas Asiades, Thoon, Oenomaus,"
300,11,148,Were those that follow’d Asius. Within the gates they found
300,11,149,"Two eminently valorous, that from the race renown’d"
300,11,150,Of the right valiant Lapithes deriv’d their high descent;
300,11,151,"Fierce Leontëus was the one, like Mars in detriment.[1]"
300,11,152,"The other mighty Polypæt, the great Pirithous’ son."
300,11,153,"These stood within the lofty gates, and nothing more did shun"
300,11,154,"The charge of Asius and his friends, than two high hill - bred oaks,"
300,11,155,"Well - rooted in the binding earth, obey the airy strokes"
300,11,156,"Of wind and weather, standing firm ’gainst ev’ry season’s spite."
300,11,157,"Yet they pour on continued shouts, and bear their shields upright;"
300,11,158,When in the mean space Polypæt and Leonteus cheer’d
300,11,159,Their soldiers to the fleet’s defence. But when the rest had heard
300,11,160,"The Trojans in attempt to scale, clamour and flight did flow"
300,11,161,"Amongst the Grecians; and then, the rest dismay’d, these two"
300,11,162,"Met Asius ent’ring, thrust him back, and fought before their doors."
300,11,163,"Nor far’d they then like oaks that stood, but as a brace of boars,"
300,11,164,"Couch’d in their own bred hill, that hear a sort of hunter’s shout,"
300,11,165,"And hounds in hot trail coming on, then from their dens break out,"
300,11,166,"Traverse their force, and suffer not, in wildness of their way,"
300,11,167,"About them any plant to stand, but thickets off’ring stay"
300,11,168,"Break through, and rend up by the roots, whet gnashes into air,"
300,11,169,"Which Tumult fills with shouts, hounds, horns, and all the hot affair"
300,11,170,"Beats at their bosoms; so their arms rung with assailing blows,"
300,11,171,"And so they stirr’d them in repulse, right well assur’d that those"
300,11,172,"Who were within, and on the wall, would add their parts, who knew"
300,11,173,"They now fought for their tents, fleet, lives, and fame, and therefore"
300,11,174,threw
300,11,175,"Stones from the walls and tow’rs, as thick as when a drift wind shakes"
300,11,176,"Black clouds in pieces, and plucks snow, in great and plumy flakes,"
300,11,177,"From their soft bosoms, till the ground be wholly cloth’d in white;"
300,11,178,"So earth was hid with stones and darts, darts from the Trojan fight,"
300,11,179,"Stones from the Greeks, that on the helms and bossy Trojan shields"
300,11,180,"Kept such a rapping, it amaz’d great Asius, who now yields"
300,11,181,"Sighs, beats his thighs, and in a rage his fault to Jove applies:"
300,11,182,"“O Jove,” said he, “now clear thou show’st thou art a friend to lies,"
300,11,183,"Pretending, in the flight of Greece, the making of it good,"
300,11,184,"To all their ruins, which I thought could never be withstood;"
300,11,185,"Yet they, as yellow wasps, or bees (that having made their nest[2]"
300,11,186,The grasping cranny of a hill) when for a hunter’s feast
300,11,187,"Hunters come hot and hungry in, and dig for honey - combs,"
300,11,188,"Then fly upon them, strike and sting, and from their hollow homes"
300,11,189,"Will not be beaten, but defend their labour’s fruit, and brood;"
300,11,190,"No more will these be from their port, but either lose their blood"
300,11,191,(Although but two against all us) or be our pris’ners made.”
300,11,192,"All this, to do his action grace, could not firm Jove persuade,"
300,11,193,"Who for the gen’ral counsel stood, and ’gainst his singular brave,"
300,11,194,Bestow’d on Hector that day’s fame. Yet he and these behave
300,11,195,"Themselves thus nobly at this port; but how at other ports,"
300,11,196,"And all alongst the stony wall, sole force, ’gainst force and forts,"
300,11,197,"Rag’d in contention ’twixt both hosts, it were no easy thing,"
300,11,198,"Had I the bosom of a God, to tune to life and sing."
300,11,199,"The Trojans fought not of themselves, a fire from heav’n was thrown"
300,11,200,"That ran amongst them, through the wall, mere added to their own."
300,11,201,"The Greeks held not their own; weak Grief went with her wither’d hand,"
300,11,202,"And dipp’d it deeply in their spirits, since they could not command"
300,11,203,"Their forces to abide the field, whom harsh Necessity,"
300,11,204,"To save those ships should bring them home, and their good fort’s"
300,11,205,"supply,"
300,11,206,Drave to th’ expulsive fight they made; and this might stoop them more
300,11,207,"Than Need itself could elevate, for ev’n Gods did deplore"
300,11,208,"Their dire estates, and all the Gods that were their aids in war,"
300,11,209,"Who, though they could not clear their plights, yet were their friends"
300,11,210,"thus far,"
300,11,211,Still to uphold the better sort; for then did Polypæt pass
300,11,212,"A lance at Damasus, whose helm was made with cheeks of brass,"
300,11,213,"Yet had not proof enough, the pile drave through it and his skull."
300,11,214,"His brain in blood drown’d, and the man, so late so spiritfull,"
300,11,215,Fell now quite spiritless to earth. So emptied he the veins
300,11,216,"Of Pylon, and Ormenus’ lives. And then Leonteüs gains"
300,11,217,"The life’s end of Hippomachus, Antimachus’s son;"
300,11,218,"His lance fell at his girdle - stead, and with his end begun"
300,11,219,"Another end. Leonteüs left him, and through the prease"
300,11,220,"(His keen sword drawn) ran desp’rately upon Antiphates,"
300,11,221,And lifeless tumbled him to earth. Nor could all these lives quench
300,11,222,"His fi’ry spirit, that his flame in Menon’s blood did drench,"
300,11,223,"And rag’d up ev’n to Iamen’s, and young Orestes’ life;"
300,11,224,All heap’d together made their peace in that red field of strife.
300,11,225,"Whose fair arms while the victors spoil’d, the youth of Ilion"
300,11,226,(Of which there serv’d the most and best) still boldly built upon
300,11,227,"The wisdom of Polydamas, and Hector’s matchless strength,"
300,11,228,"And follow’d, fill’d with wondrous spirit, with wish and hope at length,"
300,11,229,"The Greeks’ wall won, to fire their fleet. But, having pass’d the dike,"
300,11,230,"And willing now to pass the wall, this prodigy did strike"
300,11,231,Their hearts with some delib’rate stay: A high - flown eagle soar’d
300,11,232,"On their troops’ left hand, and sustain’d a dragon, all engor’d,"
300,11,233,"In her strong seres, of wondrous size, and yet had no such check"
300,11,234,"In life and spirit but still she fought, and turning back her neck"
300,11,235,"So stung the eagle’s gorge, that down she cast her fervent prey"
300,11,236,"Amongst the multitude, and took upon the winds her way,"
300,11,237,Crying with anguish. When they saw a branded serpent sprawl
300,11,238,"So full amongst them from above, and from Jove’s fowl let fall,"
300,11,239,"They took it an ostent from him, stood frighted, and their cause"
300,11,240,"Polydamas thought just, and spake: “Hector, you know, applause"
300,11,241,"Of humour hath been far from me; nor fits it, or in war,"
300,11,242,"Or in affairs of court, a man employ’d in public care"
300,11,243,"To blanch things further than their truth, or flatter any pow’r;"
300,11,244,And therefore for that simple course your strength has oft been sour
300,11,245,"To me in councils; yet again, what shows in my thoughts best,"
300,11,246,"I must discover. Let us cease, and make their flight our rest"
300,11,247,"For this day’s honour, and not now attempt the Grecian fleet,"
300,11,248,"For this, I fear, will be th’ event, the prodigy doth meet"
300,11,249,So full with our affair in hand. As this high - flying fowl
300,11,250,"Upon the left wing of our host, implying our control,"
300,11,251,"Hover’d above us, and did truss within her golden seres"
300,11,252,"A serpent so embru’d and big, which yet, in all her fears,"
300,11,253,"Kept life and fervent spirit to fight, and wrought her own release,"
300,11,254,Nor did the eagle’s eyry feed; so though we thus far prease
300,11,255,"Upon the Grecians, and perhaps may overrun their wall,"
300,11,256,"Our high minds aiming at their fleet, and that we much appall"
300,11,257,Their trusséd spirits; yet are they so serpent - like dispos’d
300,11,258,"That they will fight, though in our seres, and will at length be los’d"
300,11,259,"With all our outcries, and the life of many a Trojan breast"
300,11,260,"Shall with the eagle fly, before we carry to our nest"
300,11,261,"Them, or their navy.” Thus expounds the augur this ostent,"
300,11,262,"Whose depth he knows, and these should fear. Hector, with count’nance"
300,11,263,"bent,"
300,11,264,"Thus answer’d him: “Polydamas, your depth in augury"
300,11,265,"I like not, and know passing well thou dost not satisfy"
300,11,266,"Thyself in this opinion; or if thou think’st it true,"
300,11,267,"Thy thoughts the Gods blind, to advise, and urge that as our due,"
300,11,268,"That breaks our duties, and to Jove, whose vow and sign to me"
300,11,269,"Is pass’d directly for our speed; yet light - wing’d birds must be,"
300,11,270,"By thy advice, our oracles, whose feathers little stay"
300,11,271,"My serious actions. What care I, if this, or th’ other, way"
300,11,272,"Their wild wings sway them; if the right, on which the sun doth rise,"
300,11,273,"Or, to the left hand, where he sets? ’Tis Jove’s high counsel flys"
300,11,274,"With those wings that shall bear up us; Jove’s, that both earth and"
300,11,275,"heav’n,"
300,11,276,"Both men and Gods, sustains and rules. One augury is giv’n"
300,11,277,"To order all men, best of all; Fight for thy country’s right."
300,11,278,But why fear’st thou our further charge? For though the dang’rous fight
300,11,279,"Strew all men here about the fleet, yet thou need’st never fear"
300,11,280,To bear their fates; thy wary heart will never trust thee where
300,11,281,"An enemy’s look is; and yet fight, for, if thou dar’st abstain,"
300,11,282,Or whisper into any ear an abstinence so vain
300,11,283,"As thou advisest, never fear that any foe shall take"
300,11,284,"Thy life from thee, for ’tis this lance.” This said, all forwards make,"
300,11,285,"Himself the first; yet before him exulting Clamour flew,"
300,11,286,And thunder - loving Jupiter from lofty Ida blew
300,11,287,"A storm that usher’d their assault, and made them charge like him."
300,11,288,It drave directly on the fleet a dust so fierce and dim
300,11,289,"That it amaz’d the Grecians, but was a grace divine"
300,11,290,"To Hector and his following troops, who wholly did incline"
300,11,291,"To him, being now in grace with Jove, and so put boldly on"
300,11,292,To raze the rampire; in whose height they fiercely set upon
300,11,293,"The parapets, and pull’d them down, raz’d ev’ry foremost fight,"
300,11,294,"And all the buttresses of stone, that held their tow’rs upright,"
300,11,295,"They tore away with crows of iron, and hop’d to ruin all."
300,11,296,"The Greeks yet stood, and still repair’d the fore - fights of their wall"
300,11,297,"With hides of oxen, and from thence, they pour’d down stones in show’rs"
300,11,298,Upon the underminer’s heads. Within the foremost tow’rs
300,11,299,"Both the Ajaces had command, who answer’d ev’ry part,"
300,11,300,"Th’ assaulters, and their soldiers, repress’d, and put in heart;"
300,11,301,"Repairing valour as their wall; spake some fair, some reprov’d,"
300,11,302,Whoever made not good his place; and thus they all sorts mov’d:
300,11,303,"“O countrymen, now need in aid would have excess be spent,"
300,11,304,"The excellent must be admir’d, the meanest excellent,"
300,11,305,"The worst do well. In changing war all should not be alike,"
300,11,306,"Nor any idle; which to know fits all, lest Hector strike"
300,11,307,"Your minds with frights, as ears with threats. Forward be all your"
300,11,308,"hands,"
300,11,309,"Urge one another. This doubt down, that now betwixt us stands,"
300,11,310,Jove will go with us to their walls.” To this effect aloud
300,11,311,"Spake both the princes; and as high, with this, th’ expulsion flow’d."
300,11,312,"And as in winter time, when Jove his cold sharp jav’lins throws"
300,11,313,"Amongst us mortals, and is moved to white earth with his snows,"
300,11,314,"The winds asleep, he freely pours, till highest prominents,"
300,11,315,"Hill tops, low meadows, and the fields that crown with most contents"
300,11,316,"The toils of men, seaports, and shores, are hid, and ev’ry place,"
300,11,317,"But floods, that snow’s fair tender flakes, as their own brood,"
300,11,318,embrace;
300,11,319,"So both sides cover’d earth with stones, so both for life contend,"
300,11,320,To show their sharpness; through the wall uproar stood up an end.
300,11,321,"Nor had great Hector and his friends the rampire overrun,"
300,11,322,"If heav’n’s great Counsellor, high Jove, had not inflam’d his son"
300,11,323,Sarpedon (like the forest’s king when he on oxen flies)
300,11,324,"Against the Grecians; his round targe he to his arm applies,"
300,11,325,"Brass - leav’d without, and all within thick ox - hides quilted hard,"
300,11,326,"The verge nail’d round with rods of gold; and, with two darts prepar’d,"
300,11,327,"He leads his people. As ye see a mountain - lion fare,"
300,11,328,"Long kept from prey, in forcing which, his high mind makes him dare"
300,11,329,"Assault upon the whole full fold, though guarded never so"
300,11,330,"With well - arm’d men, and eager dogs; away he will not go,"
300,11,331,"But venture on, and either snatch a prey, or be a prey;"
300,11,332,"So far’d divine Sarpedon’s mind, resolv’d to force his way"
300,11,333,"Through all the fore - fights, and the wall; yet since he did not see"
300,11,334,"Others as great as he in name, as great in mind as he,"
300,11,335,"He spake to Glaucus:[3] “Glaucus, say, why are we honour’d more"
300,11,336,"Than other men of Lycia, in place; with greater store"
300,11,337,Of meats and cups; with goodlier roofs; delightsome gardens; walks;
300,11,338,"More lands and better; so much wealth, that court and country talks"
300,11,339,"Of us and our possessions, and ev’ry way we go,"
300,11,340,Gaze on us as we were their Gods? This where we dwell is so;
300,11,341,The shores of Xanthus ring of this; and shall we not exceed
300,11,342,"As much in merit as in noise? Come, be we great in deed"
300,11,343,"As well as look; shine not in gold, but in the flames of fight;"
300,11,344,"That so our neat - arm’d Lycians may say: ‘See, these are right"
300,11,345,"Our kings, our rulers; these deserve to eat and drink the best;"
300,11,346,"These govern not ingloriously; these, thus exceed the rest,"
300,11,347,"Do more than they command to do.’ O friend, if keeping back"
300,11,348,"Would keep back age from us, and death, and that we might not wrack"
300,11,349,"In this life’s human sea at all, but that deferring now"
300,11,350,"We shunn’d death ever, nor would I half this vain valour show,"
300,11,351,"Nor glorify a folly so, to wish thee to advance;"
300,11,352,"But since we must go, though not here, and that, besides the chance"
300,11,353,"Propos’d now, there are infinite fates of other sort in death,"
300,11,354,"Which, neither to be fled nor ’scaped, a man must sink beneath,"
300,11,355,"Come, try we, if this sort be ours, and either render thus"
300,11,356,"Glory to others, or make them resign the like to us.”"
300,11,357,"This motion Glaucus shifted not, but without words obey’d."
300,11,358,"Foreright went both, a mighty troop of Lycians followéd."
300,11,359,"Which by Menestheus observ’d, his hair stood up on end,"
300,11,360,"For, at the tow’r where he had charge, he saw Calamity bend"
300,11,361,Her horrid brows in their approach. He threw his looks about
300,11,362,"The whole fights near, to see what chief might help the mis’ry out"
300,11,363,"Of his poor soldiers, and beheld where both th’ Ajaces fought,"
300,11,364,And Teucer newly come from fleet; whom it would profit nought
300,11,365,"To call, since tumult on their helms, shields, and upon the ports,"
300,11,366,"Laid such loud claps; for ev’ry way, defences of all sorts"
300,11,367,"Were adding, as Troy took away; and Clamour flew so high"
300,11,368,"Her wings strook heav’n, and drown’d all voice. The two dukes yet so"
300,11,369,nigh
300,11,370,"And at the offer of assault, he to th’ Ajaces sent"
300,11,371,Thoos the herald with this charge: “Run to the regiment
300,11,372,"Of both th’ Ajaces, and call both, for both were better here,"
300,11,373,"Since here will slaughter, instantly, be more enforc’d than there."
300,11,374,"The Lycian captains this way make, who in the fights of stand"
300,11,375,Have often show’d much excellence. Yet if laborious hand
300,11,376,"Be there more needful than I hope, at least afford us some,"
300,11,377,Let Ajax Telamonius and th’ archer Teucer come.”
300,11,378,"The herald hasted, and arriv’d; and both th’ Ajaces told,"
300,11,379,That Peteus’ noble son desir’d their little labour would
300,11,380,"Employ himself in succouring him. Both their supplies were best,"
300,11,381,Since death assail’d his quarter most; for on it fiercely press’d
300,11,382,The well - prov’d mighty Lycian chiefs. Yet if the service there
300,11,383,"Allow’d not both, he pray’d that one part of his charge would bear,"
300,11,384,"And that was Ajax Telamon, with whom he wish’d would come"
300,11,385,The archer Teucer. Telamon left instantly his room
300,11,386,"To strong Lycomedes, and will’d Ajax Oiliades"
300,11,387,"With him to make up his supply, and fill with courages"
300,11,388,The Grecian hearts till his return; which should he instantly
300,11,389,When he had well reliev’d his friend. With this the company
300,11,390,"Of Teucer he took to his aid; Teucer, that did descend"
300,11,391,(As Ajax did) from Telamon. With these two did attend
300,11,392,"Pandion, that bore Teucer’s bow. When to Menestheus’ tow’r"
300,11,393,"They came, alongst the wall, they found him, and his hearten’d pow’r,"
300,11,394,Toiling in making strong their fort. The Lycian princes set
300,11,395,"Black whirlwind - like, with both their pow’rs, upon the parapet."
300,11,396,"Ajax, and all, resisted them. Clamour amongst them rose."
300,11,397,The slaughter Ajax led; who first the last dear sight did close
300,11,398,"Of strong Epicles, that was friend to Jove’s great Lycian son."
300,11,399,"Amongst the high munition heap, a mighty marble stone"
300,11,400,"Lay highest, near the pinnacle, a stone of such a paise"
300,11,401,"That one of this time’s strongest men with both hands could not raise,"
300,11,402,"Yet this did Ajax rouse and throw, and all in sherds did drive"
300,11,403,Epicles’ four - topp’d casque and skull; who (as ye see one dive
300,11,404,In some deep river) left his height; life left his bones withal.
300,11,405,"Teucer shot Glaucus, rushing up yet higher on the wall,"
300,11,406,"Where naked he discern’d his arm, and made him steal retreat"
300,11,407,"From that hot service, lest some Greek, with an insulting threat,"
300,11,408,"Beholding it, might fright the rest. Sarpedon much was griev’d"
300,11,409,"At Glaucus parting, yet fought on, and his great heart reliev’d"
300,11,410,"A little with Alcmaon’s blood, surnam’d Thestorides,"
300,11,411,Whose life he hurl’d out with his lance; which following through the
300,11,412,prease
300,11,413,He drew from him. Down from the tow’r Alcmaon dead it strook;
300,11,414,His fair arms ringing out his death. Then fierce Sarpedon took
300,11,415,"In his strong hand the battlement, and down he tore it quite,"
300,11,416,"The wall stripp’d naked, and broad way for entry and full fight"
300,11,417,He made the many. Against him Ajax and Teucer made;
300,11,418,Teucer the rich belt on his breast did with a shaft invade;
300,11,419,"But Jupiter averted death, who would not see his son"
300,11,420,"Die at the tails of th’ Achive ships. Ajax did fetch his run,"
300,11,421,"And, with his lance, strook through the targe of that brave Lycian"
300,11,422,king;
300,11,423,"Yet kept he it from further pass, nor did it anything"
300,11,424,"Dismay his mind, although his men stood off from that high way"
300,11,425,"His valour made them, which he kept, and hop’d that stormy day"
300,11,426,Should ever make his glory clear. His men’s fault thus he blam’d:
300,11,427,"“O Lycians, why are your hot spirits so quickly disinflam’d?"
300,11,428,"Suppose me ablest of you all, ’tis hard for me alone"
300,11,429,"To ruin such a wall as this, and make confusion"
300,11,430,"Way to their navy. Lend your hands. What many can dispatch,"
300,11,431,One cannot think. The noble work of many hath no match.”
300,11,432,The wise king’s just rebuke did strike a rev’rence to his will
300,11,433,"Through all his soldiers; all stood in, and ’gainst all th’ Achives"
300,11,434,still
300,11,435,"Made strong their squadrons, insomuch, that to the adverse side,"
300,11,436,"The work show’d mighty, and the wall, when ’twas within descried,"
300,11,437,No easy service; yet the Greeks could neither free their wall
300,11,438,"Of these brave Lycians, that held firm the place they first did scale;"
300,11,439,"Nor could the Lycians from their fort the sturdy Grecians drive,"
300,11,440,Nor reach their fleet. But as two men about the limits strive
300,11,441,"Of land that toucheth in a field, their measures in their hands,"
300,11,442,"They mete their parts out curiously, and either stiffly stands"
300,11,443,"That so far is his right in law, both hugely set on fire"
300,11,444,"About a passing - little ground; so, greedily aspire"
300,11,445,"Both these foes to their sev’ral ends, and all exhaust their most"
300,11,446,About the very battlements (for yet no more was lost ).[4]
300,11,447,"With sword and fire they vex’d for them their targes hugely round,"
300,11,448,"With ox - hides lin’d, and bucklers light; and many a ghastly wound"
300,11,449,The stern steel gave for that one prise; whereof though some receiv’d
300,11,450,"Their portions on their naked backs, yet others were bereav’d"
300,11,451,"Of brave lives, face - turn’d, through their shields; tow’rs, bulwarks,"
300,11,452,ev’rywhere
300,11,453,Were freckled with the blood of men. Nor yet the Greeks did bear
300,11,454,Base back - turn’d faces; nor their foes would therefore be out - fac’d.
300,11,455,"But as a spinster poor and just, ye sometimes see, straight - lac’d"
300,11,456,"About the weighing of her web, who, careful, having charge"
300,11,457,"For which she would provide some means, is loth to be too large"
300,11,458,"In giving or in taking weight, but ever with her hand"
300,11,459,"Is doing with the weights and wool, till both in just paise stand;[5]"
300,11,460,"So ev’nly stood it with these foes, till Jove to Hector gave"
300,11,461,"The turning of the scales; who first against the rampire drave,"
300,11,462,"And spake so loud that all might hear: “O stand not at the pale,"
300,11,463,"Brave Trojan friends, but mend your hands; up, and break through the"
300,11,464,"wall,"
300,11,465,"And make a bonfire of their fleet.” All heard, and all in heaps"
300,11,466,"Got scaling - ladders, and aloft. In mean space, Hector leaps"
300,11,467,"Upon the port, from whose out - part he tore a massy stone,"
300,11,468,"Thick downwards, upward edg’d; it was so huge an one"
300,11,469,"That two vast yeomen of most strength, such as these times beget,[6]"
300,11,470,"Could not from earth lift to a cart, yet he did brandish it"
300,11,471,"Alone, Saturnius made it light; and swinging it as nought,"
300,11,472,"He came before the planky gates, that all for strength were wrought,"
300,11,473,"And kept the port; two - fold they were, and with two rafters barr’d,"
300,11,474,"High, and strong - lock’d; he rais’d the stone, bent to the hurl so hard,"
300,11,475,"And made it with so main a strength, that all the gates did crack,"
300,11,476,"The rafters left them, and the folds one from another brake,"
300,11,477,"The hinges piecemeal flew, and through the fervent little rock"
300,11,478,"Thunder’d a passage; with his weight th’ inwall his breast did knock,"
300,11,479,"And in rush’d Hector, fierce and grim as any stormy night;"
300,11,480,His brass arms round about his breast reflected terrible light;
300,11,481,Each arm held - up held each a dart; his presence call’d up all
300,11,482,"The dreadful spirits his being held, that to the threaten’d wall"
300,11,483,None but the Gods might check his way; his eyes were furnaces;
300,11,484,"And thus he look’d back, call’d in all. All fir’d their courages,"
300,11,485,"And in they flow’d. The Grecians fled, their fleet now and their"
300,11,486,freight
300,11,487,Ask’d all their rescue. Greece went down; Tumult was at his height.

300,11,496,"expressive, with his old rule, _uno pede, etc_."
300,11,497,"[5] A simile superior to the other, in which, comparing mightiest"
300,11,498,"things with meanest, and the meanest illustrating the mightiest, both"
300,11,499,"meeting in one end of this life’s preservation and credit, our Homer"
300,11,500,is beyond comparison and admiration.
300,11,501,"[6] Δύ ἀνέρε δήμου, Duo viri plebei."
300,12,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,12,2,Neptune (in pity of the Greeks’ hard plight)
300,12,3,"Like Calchas, both th’ Ajaces doth excite,"
300,12,4,"And others, to repel the charging foe."
300,12,5,Idomenëus bravely doth bestow
300,12,6,"His kingly forces, and doth sacrifice"
300,12,7,"Othryonëus to the Destinies,"
300,12,8,"With divers others. Fair Deiphobus,"
300,12,9,"And his prophetic brother Helenus,"
300,12,10,Are wounded. But the great Priamides.
300,12,11,"Gath’ring his forces, heartens their address"
300,12,12,Against the enemy; and then the field
300,12,13,A mighty death on either side doth yield.
300,12,14,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,12,15,"The Greeks, with Troy’s bold pow’r dismay’d,"
300,12,16,Are cheer’d by Neptune’s secret aid.
300,12,17,"Jove helping Hector, and his host, thus close Achive fleet,"
300,12,18,"He let them then their own strengths try, and season there their sweet"
300,12,19,"With ceaseless toils and grievances; for now he turn’d his face,"
300,12,20,"Look’d down, and view’d the far - off land of well - rode men in Thrace,"
300,12,21,"Of the renown’d milk - nourish’d men, the Hippemolgians,"
300,12,22,"Long - liv’d, most just, and innocent, and close - fought Mysians."
300,12,23,"Nor turn’d he any more to Troy his ever - shining eyes,"
300,12,24,"Because he thought not any one, of all the Deities,"
300,12,25,"When his care left th’ indiff’rent field, would aid on either side."
300,12,26,"But this security in Jove the great Sea - Rector spied,"
300,12,27,"Who sat aloft on th’ utmost top of shady Samothrace,"
300,12,28,"And view’d the fight. His chosen seat stood in so brave a place,"
300,12,29,"That Priam’s city, th’ Achive ships, all Ida, did appear"
300,12,30,To his full view; who from the sea was therefore seated there.
300,12,31,"He took much ruth to see the Greeks by Troy sustain such ill,"
300,12,32,"And, mightily incens’d with Jove, stoop’d straight from that steep"
300,12,33,"hill,"
300,12,34,"That shook as he flew off, so hard his parting press’d the height."
300,12,35,"The woods, and all the great hills near, trembled beneath the weight"
300,12,36,"Of his immortal moving feet. Three steps he only took,"
300,12,37,"Before he far - off Ægas reach’d, but, with the fourth, it shook"
300,12,38,With his dread entry. In the depth of those seas he did hold
300,12,39,"His bright and glorious palace, built of never - rusting gold;"
300,12,40,"And there arriv’d, he put in coach his brazen - footed steeds,"
300,12,41,"All golden - maned, and pac’d with wings; and all in golden weeds"
300,12,42,"He cloth’d himself. The golden scourge, most elegantly done,"
300,12,43,"He took, and mounted to his seat; and then the God begun"
300,12,44,To drive his chariot through the waves. From whirlpits ev’ry way
300,12,45,"The whales exulted under him, and knew their king; the sea"
300,12,46,"For joy did open; and, his horse so swift and lightly flew,"
300,12,47,The under axletree of brass no drop of water drew;
300,12,48,And thus these deathless coursers brought their king to th’ Achive
300,12,49,ships.
300,12,50,"‘Twixt th’ Imber cliffs and Tenedos, a certain cavern creeps"
300,12,51,"Into the deep sea’s gulfy breast, and there th’ Earth - shaker stay’d"
300,12,52,"His forward steeds, took them from coach, and heav’nly fodder laid"
300,12,53,"In reach before them; their brass hoves he girt with gyves of gold,"
300,12,54,"Not to be broken, nor dissolved, to make them firmly hold"
300,12,55,"A fit attendance on their king; who went to th’ Achive host,"
300,12,56,"Which, like to tempests or wild flames, the clust’ring Trojans tost,"
300,12,57,"Insatiably valorous, in Hector’s like command,"
300,12,58,"High sounding, and resounding, shouts; for hope cheer’d ev’ry hand,"
300,12,59,"To make the Greek fleet now their prise, and all the Greeks destroy."
300,12,60,"But Neptune, circler of the earth, with fresh heart did employ"
300,12,61,The Grecian hands. In strength of voice and body he did take
300,12,62,"Calchas’ resemblance, and, of all, th’ Ajaces first bespake,"
300,12,63,"Who of themselves were free enough: “Ajaces, you alone"
300,12,64,"Sustain the common good of Greece, in ever putting on"
300,12,65,"The memory of fortitude, and flying shameful flight."
300,12,66,"Elsewhere the desp’rate hands of Troy could give me no affright,"
300,12,67,The brave Greeks have withstood their worst; but this our mighty wall
300,12,68,"Being thus transcended by their pow’r, grave fear doth much appall"
300,12,69,"My careful spirits, lest we feel some fatal mischief here,"
300,12,70,"Where Hector, raging like a flame, doth in his charge appear,"
300,12,71,"And boasts himself the best God’s son. Be you conceited so,"
300,12,72,"And fire so, more than human spirits, that God may seem to do"
300,12,73,"In your deeds, and, with such thoughts cheer’d, others to such exhort,"
300,12,74,And such resistance; these great minds will in as great a sort
300,12,75,"Strengthen your bodies, and force check to all great Hector’s charge,"
300,12,76,"Though ne’er so spirit - like, and though Jove still, past himself,"
300,12,77,enlarge
300,12,78,"His sacred actions.” Thus he touched, with his fork’d sceptre’s point,"
300,12,79,"The breasts of both; fill’d both their spirits, and made up ev’ry joint"
300,12,80,"With pow’r responsive; when, hawk - like, swift, and set sharp to fly,"
300,12,81,"That fiercely stooping from a rock, inaccessible and high,"
300,12,82,"Cuts through a field, and sets a fowl (not being of her kind)"
300,12,83,"Hard, and gets ground still; Neptune so left these two, either’s mind"
300,12,84,"Beyond themselves rais’d. Of both which, Oïleus first discern’d"
300,12,85,"The masking Deity, and said: “Ajax, some God hath warn’d"
300,12,86,"Our pow’rs to fight, and save our fleet. He put on him the hue"
300,12,87,"Of th’ augur Calchas. By his pace, in leaving us, I knew,"
300,12,88,"Without all question, ’twas a God; the Gods are eas’ly known;"
300,12,89,"And in my tender breast I feel a greater spirit blown,"
300,12,90,To execute affairs of fight; I find my hands so free
300,12,91,"To all high motion, and my feet seem feather’d under me,”"
300,12,92,"This Telamonius thus receiv’d: “So, to my thoughts, my hands"
300,12,93,Burn with desire to toss my lance; each foot beneath me stands
300,12,94,"Bare on bright fire, to use his speed; my heart is rais’d so high"
300,12,95,"That to encounter Hector’s self, I long insatiately.”"
300,12,96,"While these thus talk’d, as overjoy’d with study for the fight,"
300,12,97,(Which God had stirr’d up in their spirits) the same God did excite
300,12,98,"The Greeks that were behind at fleet, refreshing their free hearts"
300,12,99,"And joints, being ev’n dissolv’d with toil; and (seeing the desp’rate"
300,12,100,parts
300,12,101,"Play’d by the Trojans past their wall) grief strook them, and their"
300,12,102,eyes
300,12,103,"Sweat tears from under their sad lids, their instant destinies"
300,12,104,"Never supposing they could ’scape. But Neptune, stepping in,"
300,12,105,"With ease stirr’d up the able troops, and did at first begin"
300,12,106,"With Teucer, and Peneleüs, th’ heroe Leitus,"
300,12,107,"Deipyrus, Meriones, and young Antilochus,"
300,12,108,"All éxpert in the deeds of arms: “O youths of Greece,” said he,"
300,12,109,"“What change is this? In your brave fight, I only look’d to see"
300,12,110,"Our fleet’s whole safety; and, if you neglect the harmful field,"
300,12,111,Now shines the day when Greece to Troy must all her honours yield.
300,12,112,"O grief! So great a miracle, and horrible to sight,"
300,12,113,"As now I see, I never thought could have profan’d the light!"
300,12,114,"The Trojans brave us at our ships, that have been heretofore"
300,12,115,"Like faint and fearful deer in woods, distracted evermore"
300,12,116,"With ev’ry sound, and yet ’scape not, but prove the torn up fare"
300,12,117,"Of lynces, wolves, and lëopards, as never born to war."
300,12,118,"Nor durst these Trojans at first siege, in any least degree,"
300,12,119,"Expect your strength, or stand one shock of Grecian chivalry;"
300,12,120,"Yet now, far from their walls, they dare fight at our fleet maintain,"
300,12,121,"All by our Gen’ral’s cowardice, that doth infect his men"
300,12,122,"Who, still at odds with him, for that will needs themselves neglect,"
300,12,123,And suffer slaughter in their ships. Suppose there was defect
300,12,124,"(Beyond all question) in our king, to wrong Æacides,"
300,12,125,"And he, for his particular wreak, from all assistance cease;"
300,12,126,"We must not cease t’ assist ourselves. Forgive our Gen’ral then,"
300,12,127,And quickly too. Apt to forgive are all good - minded men.
300,12,128,"Yet you, quite void of their good minds, give good, in you quite lost,"
300,12,129,"For ill in others, though ye be the worthiest of your host."
300,12,130,"As old as I am, I would scorn, to fight with one that flies,"
300,12,131,"Or leaves the fight as you do now. The Gen’ral slothful lies,"
300,12,132,"And you, though slothful too, maintain with him a fight of spleen."
300,12,133,"Out, out, I hate ye from my heart. Ye rotten - minded men,"
300,12,134,In this ye add an ill that’s worse than all your sloth’s dislikes.
300,12,135,"But as I know to all your hearts my reprehension strikes,"
300,12,136,So thither let just shame strike too; for while you stand still here
300,12,137,"A mighty fight swarms at your fleet, great Hector rageth there,"
300,12,138,"Hath burst the long bar and the gates.” Thus Neptune rous’d these men,"
300,12,139,And round about th’ Ajaces did their phalanxes maintain
300,12,140,"Their station firm; whom Mars himself, had he amongst them gone,"
300,12,141,"Could not disparage, nor Jove’s Maid that sets men fiercer on;"
300,12,142,"For now the best were chosen out, and they receiv’d th’ advance"
300,12,143,"Of Hector and his men so full, that lance was lin’d with lance,"
300,12,144,"Shields thicken’d with opposéd shields, targets to targets nail’d,"
300,12,145,"Helms stuck to helms, and man to man grew, they so close assail’d,"
300,12,146,"Plum’d casques were hang’d in either’s plumes, all join’d so close"
300,12,147,"their stands,"
300,12,148,"Their lances stood, thrust out so thick by such all - daring hands,"
300,12,149,"All bent their firm breasts to the point, and made sad fight their joy"
300,12,150,"Of both. Troy all in heaps strook first, and Hector first of Troy."
300,12,151,"And as a round piece of a rock, which with a winter’s flood"
300,12,152,"Is from his top torn, when a show’r, pour’d from a bursten cloud,"
300,12,153,"Hath broke the natural bond it held within the rough steep rock,"
300,12,154,"And, jumping, it flies down the woods, resounding ev’ry shock,"
300,12,155,"And on, uncheck’d, it headlong leaps, till in a plain it stay,"
300,12,156,"And then, though never so impell’d, it stirs not any way;"
300,12,157,"So Hector hereto throated threats, to go to sea in blood,"
300,12,158,"And reach the Grecian ships and tents, without being once withstood."
300,12,159,"But when he fell into the strengths the Grecians did maintain,"
300,12,160,"And that they fought upon the square, he stood as fetter’d then;"
300,12,161,"And so the adverse sons of Greece laid on with swords and darts,"
300,12,162,"Whose both ends hurt, that they repell’d his worst; and he converts"
300,12,163,"His threats, by all means, to retreats; yet made as he retir’d,"
300,12,164,Only t’ encourage those behind; and thus those men inspir’d:
300,12,165,"“Trojans! Dardanians! Lycians! All warlike friends, stand close;"
300,12,166,"The Greeks can never bear me long, though tow’r - like they oppose."
300,12,167,"This lance, be sure, will be their spoil; if ev’n the best of Gods,"
300,12,168,"High thund’ring Juno’s husband, stirs my spirit with true abodes,”"
300,12,169,"With this all strengths and minds he mov’d; but young Deiphobus,"
300,12,170,"Old Priam’s son, amongst them all was chiefly virtuous,"
300,12,171,"He bore before him his round shield, tripp’d lightly through the"
300,12,172,"prease,"
300,12,173,At all parts cover’d with his shield; and him Meriones
300,12,174,"Charg’d with a glitt’ring dart, that took his bull - hide orby shield,"
300,12,175,"Yet pierc’d it not, but in the top itself did piecemeal yield,"
300,12,176,"Deiphobus thrust forth his targe, and fear’d the broken ends"
300,12,177,"Of strong Meriones’s lance, who now turn’d to his friends;"
300,12,178,The great heroë scorning much by such a chance to part
300,12,179,"With lance and conquest, forth he went to fetch another dart,"
300,12,180,"Left at his tent. The rest fought on, the clamour heighten’d there"
300,12,181,"Was most unmeasur’d. Teucer first did flesh the massacre,"
300,12,182,"And slew a goodly man at arms, the soldier Imbrius,"
300,12,183,"The son of Mentor, rich in horse; he dwelt at Pedasus"
300,12,184,Before the sons of Greece sieg’d Troy; from whence he married
300,12,185,"Medesicaste, one that sprung of Priam’s bastard - bed;"
300,12,186,"But when the Greek ships, double - oar’d, arriv’d at Ilion,"
300,12,187,"To Ilion he return’d, and prov’d beyond comparison"
300,12,188,"Amongst the Trojans; he was lodg’d with Priam, who held dear"
300,12,189,"His natural sons no more than him; yet him, beneath the ear,"
300,12,190,"The son of Telamon attain’d, and drew his lance. He fell,"
300,12,191,As when an ash on some hill’s top (itself topp’d wondrous well)
300,12,192,"The steel hews down, and he presents his young leaves to the soil;"
300,12,193,"So fell he, and his fair arms groan’d, which Teucer long’d to spoil,"
300,12,194,"And in he ran; and Hector in, who sent a shining lance"
300,12,195,"At Teucer, who, beholding it, slipp’d by, and gave it chance"
300,12,196,"On Actor’s son, Amphimachus, whose breast it strook; and in"
300,12,197,"Flew Hector, at his sounding fall, with full intent to win"
300,12,198,The tempting helmet from his head; but Ajax with a dart
300,12,199,"Reach’d Hector at his rushing in, yet touch’d not any part"
300,12,200,About his body; it was hid quite through with horrid brass;
300,12,201,"The boss yet of his targe it took, whose firm stuff stay’d the pass,"
300,12,202,And he turn’d safe from both the trunks; both which the Grecians bore
300,12,203,"From off the field. Amphimachus Menestheus did restore,"
300,12,204,"And Stichius, to th’ Achaian strength. Th’ Ajaces (that were pleas’d"
300,12,205,Still most with most hot services) on Trojan Imbrius seiz’d.
300,12,206,"And as from sharply - bitten hounds, a brace of lions force"
300,12,207,"A new - slain goat, and through the woods bear in their jaws the corse"
300,12,208,"Aloft, lift up into the air; so, up into the skies,"
300,12,209,"Bore both th’ Ajaces Imbrius, and made his arms their prise."
300,12,210,"Yet, not content, Oïliades, enrag’d to see there dead"
300,12,211,"His much - belov’d Amphimachus, he hew’d off Imbrius’ head;"
300,12,212,"Which, swinging round, bowl - like he toss’d amongst the Trojan prease,"
300,12,213,"And full at Hector’s feet it fell. Amphimachus’ decease,"
300,12,214,"Being nephew to the God of waves, much vex’d the Deity’s mind,"
300,12,215,"And to the ships and tents he march’d, yet more to make inclin’d"
300,12,216,"The Grecians to the Trojan bane. In hasting to which end,"
300,12,217,"Idomenëus met with him, returning from a friend,"
300,12,218,"Whose ham late hurt, his men brought off; and having giv’n command"
300,12,219,"To his physicians for his cure, much fir’d to put his hand"
300,12,220,"To Troy’s repulse, he left his tent. Him (like Andremon’s son,"
300,12,221,"Prince Thoas, that in Pleuron rul’d, and lofty Calydon,"
300,12,222,"Th’ Ætolian pow’rs, and like a God was of his subjects lov’d)"
300,12,223,"Neptune encounter’d, and but thus his forward spirit mov’d:"
300,12,224,"“Idomenëus, prince of Crete! O whither now are fled"
300,12,225,"Those threats in thee, with which the rest the Trojans menacéd?”"
300,12,226,"“O Thoas,” he replied, “no one of all our host stands now"
300,12,227,"In any question of reproof, as I am let to know,"
300,12,228,"And why is my intelligence false? We all know how to fight,"
300,12,229,"And, (fear disanimating none) all do our knowledge right."
300,12,230,"Nor can our harms accuse our sloth, not one from work we miss."
300,12,231,"The great God only works our ill, whose pleasure now it is"
300,12,232,"That, far from home, in hostile fields, and with inglorious fate,"
300,12,233,"Some Greeks should perish. But do thou, O Thoas, that of late"
300,12,234,"Hast prov’d a soldier, and was wont, where thou hast sloth beheld,"
300,12,235,"To chide it, and exhort to pains, now hate to be repell’d,"
300,12,236,"And set on all men.” He replied, “I would to heav’n, that he,"
300,12,237,"Whoever this day doth abstain from battle willingly,"
300,12,238,"May never turn his face from Troy, but here become the prey"
300,12,239,"And scorn of dogs! Come then, take arms, and let our kind assay"
300,12,240,"Join both our forces. Though but two, yet, being both combin’d,"
300,12,241,"The work of many single hands we may perform. We find,"
300,12,242,"That virtue co - augmented thrives in men of little mind,"
300,12,243,"But we have singly match’d the great.” Thus said, the God again,"
300,12,244,"With all his conflicts, visited the vent’rous flight of men."
300,12,245,"The king turn’d to his tent; rich arms put on his breast, and took"
300,12,246,"Two darts in hand, and forth he flew. His haste on made him look"
300,12,247,"Much like a fi’ry meteor, with which Jove’s sulph’ry hand"
300,12,248,"Opes heav’n, and hurls about the air bright flashes, showing aland"
300,12,249,Abodes that ever run before tempest and plagues to men:
300,12,250,"So, in his swift pace, show’d his arms. He was encounter’d then"
300,12,251,By his good friend Meriones yet near his tent; to whom
300,12,252,"Thus spake the pow’r of Idomen: “What reason makes thee come,"
300,12,253,"Thou son of Molus, my most lov’d, thus leaving fight alone?"
300,12,254,"Is’t for some wound? The jav’lin’s head, still sticking in the bone,"
300,12,255,Desir’st thou ease of? Bring’st thou news? Or what is it that brings
300,12,256,"Thy presence hither? Be assur’d, my spirit needs no stings"
300,12,257,"To this hot conflict. Of myself thou seest I come, and loth,"
300,12,258,"For any tent’s love, to deserve the hateful taint of sloth.”"
300,12,259,"He answer’d: Only for a dart, he that retreat did make,"
300,12,260,"(Were any left him at his tent) for, that he had, he brake"
300,12,261,"On proud Deiphobus’s shield. “Is one dart all?” said he,"
300,12,262,"“Take one and twenty, if thou like, for in my tent they be;"
300,12,263,They stand there shining by the walls. I took them as my prise
300,12,264,From those false Trojans I have slain. And this is not the guise
300,12,265,"Of one that loves his tent, or fights afar off with his foe,"
300,12,266,"But since I love fight, therefore doth my martial star bestow,"
300,12,267,"Besides those darts, helms, targets boss’d, and corslets bright as"
300,12,268,day.”
300,12,269,"“So I,” said Merion, “at my tent, and sable bark, may say,"
300,12,270,"I many Trojan spoils retain, but now not near they be,"
300,12,271,To serve me for my present use; and therefore ask I thee.
300,12,272,"Not that I lack a fortitude to store me with my own,"
300,12,273,"For ever in the foremost fights, that render men renown,"
300,12,274,"I fight, when any fight doth stir. And this perhaps may well"
300,12,275,"Be hid to others, but thou know’st, and I to thee appeal.”"
300,12,276,"“I know,” replied the king, “how much thou weigh’st in ev’ry worth,"
300,12,277,What need’st thou therefore utter this? If we should now choose forth
300,12,278,"The worthiest men for ambushes, in all our fleet and host,"
300,12,279,"(For ambushes are services that try men’s virtues most,"
300,12,280,"Since there the fearful and the firm will, as they are, appear,"
300,12,281,"The fearful alt’ring still his hue, and rests not anywhere,"
300,12,282,"Nor is his spirit capable of th’ ambush constancy,"
300,12,283,"But riseth, changeth still his place, and croucheth curiously"
300,12,284,"On his bent haunches; half his height scarce seen above the ground,"
300,12,285,"For fear to be seen, yet must see; his heart, with many a bound,"
300,12,286,"Off’ring to leap out of his breast, and, ever fearing death,"
300,12,287,"The coldness of it makes him gnash, and half shakes out his teeth;"
300,12,288,"Where men of valour neither fear, nor ever change their looks,"
300,12,289,"From lodging th’ ambush till it rise, but, since there must be strokes,"
300,12,290,Wish to be quickly in their midst) thy strength and hand in these
300,12,291,"Who should reprove? For if, far off, or fighting in the prease,"
300,12,292,"Thou shouldst be wounded, I am sure the dart that gave the wound"
300,12,293,"Should not be drawn out of thy back, or make thy neck the ground,"
300,12,294,"But meet thy belly, or thy breast, in thrusting further yet"
300,12,295,"When thou art furthest, till the first, and before him, thou get."
300,12,296,"But on; like children let not us stand bragging thus, but do;"
300,12,297,"Lest some hear, and past measure chide, that we stand still and woo."
300,12,298,"Go, choose a better dart, and make Mars yield a better chance.”"
300,12,299,"This said, Mars - swift Meriones, with haste, a brazen lance"
300,12,300,"Took from his tent, and overtook, most careful of the wars,"
300,12,301,"Idomenëus, And such two, in field, as harmful Mars,"
300,12,302,"And Terror, his belovéd son, that without terror fights,"
300,12,303,"And is of such strength that in war the frighter he affrights,"
300,12,304,"When, out of Thrace, they both take arms against th’ Ephyran bands,"
300,12,305,"Or ’gainst the great - soul’d Phlegians, nor favour their own hands,"
300,12,306,"But give the grace to others still; in such sort to the fight,"
300,12,307,"March’d these two managers of men, in armours full of light."
300,12,308,"And first spake Merion: “On which part, son of Deucalion,"
300,12,309,Serves thy mind to invade the fight? Is’t best to set upon
300,12,310,"The Trojans, in our battle’s aid, the right or left - hand wing,"
300,12,311,For all parts I suppose employ’d?” To this the Cretan king
300,12,312,Thus answer’d: “In our navy’s midst are others that assist;
300,12,313,"The two Ajaces; Teucer too, with shafts the expertest"
300,12,314,"Of all the Grecians, and, though small, is great in fights of stand;"
300,12,315,And these (though huge he be of strength) will serve to fill the hand
300,12,316,"Of Hector’s self, that Priamist, that studier for blows."
300,12,317,It shall be call’d a deed of height for him (even suff’ring throes
300,12,318,"For knocks still) to outlabour them, and, bett’ring their tough hands,"
300,12,319,Enflame our fleet. If Jove himself cast not his fire - brands
300,12,320,"Amongst our navy, that affair no man can bring to field."
300,12,321,Great Ajax Telamonius to none alive will yield
300,12,322,"That yields to death, and whose life takes Ceres’ nutritions,"
300,12,323,"That can be cut with any iron, or pash’d with mighty stones;"
300,12,324,"Not to Æacides himself he yields for combats set,"
300,12,325,Though clear he must give place for pace and free swing of his feet.
300,12,326,"Since then, the battle (being our place of most care) is made good"
300,12,327,"By his high valour, let our aid see all pow’rs be withstood"
300,12,328,"That charge the left wing, and to that let us direct our course,"
300,12,329,"Where quickly feel we this hot foe, or make him feel our force.”"
300,12,330,"This order’d, swift Meriones went, and forewent his king,"
300,12,331,"Till both arriv’d where one enjoin’d. When, in the Greeks’ left wing,"
300,12,332,"The Trojans saw the Cretan king, like fire in fortitude,"
300,12,333,"And his attendant, in bright arms so gloriously indu’d,"
300,12,334,"Both cheering the sinister troops, all at the king address’d,"
300,12,335,"And so the skirmish at their sterns on both parts were increas’d,"
300,12,336,"That, as from hollow bustling winds engender’d storms arise,"
300,12,337,When dust doth chiefly clog the ways which up into the skies
300,12,338,"The wanton tempest ravisheth, begetting night of day;"
300,12,339,"So came together both the foes, both lusted to assay,"
300,12,340,"And work with quick steel either’s death. Man’s fierce corruptress,"
300,12,341,"Fight,"
300,12,342,"Set up her bristles in the field with lances long and light,"
300,12,343,"Which thick fell foul on either’s face. The splendour of the steel,"
300,12,344,"In new - scour’d curets, radiant casques, and burnish’d shields, did seel"
300,12,345,"Th’ assailer’s eyes up. He sustain’d a huge spirit, that was glad"
300,12,346,"To see that labour, or in soul that stood not stricken sad."
300,12,347,"Thus these two disagreeing Gods, old Saturn’s mighty sons,"
300,12,348,Afflicted these heroic men with huge oppressións.
300,12,349,Jove honouring Æacides (to let the Greeks still try
300,12,350,"Their want without him) would bestow, yet still, the victory"
300,12,351,"On Hector, and the Trojan pow’r; yet for Æacides,"
300,12,352,"And honour of his mother - queen, great Goddess of the seas,"
300,12,353,"He would not let proud Ilion see the Grecians quite destroy’d,"
300,12,354,And therefore from the hoary deep he suffered so employ’d
300,12,355,"Great Neptune in the Grecian aid; who griev’d for them, and storm’d"
300,12,356,"Extremely at his brother Jove. Yet both one Goddess form’d,"
300,12,357,"And one soil bred, but Jupiter precedence took in birth,"
300,12,358,"And had more knowledge; for which cause, the other came not forth[1]"
300,12,359,"Of his wet kingdom, but with care of not being seen t’ excite"
300,12,360,"The Grecian host, and like a man appear’d, and made the fight."
300,12,361,"So these Gods made men’s valours great, but equall’d them with war"
300,12,362,As harmful as their hearts were good; and stretch’d those chains as far
300,12,363,"On both sides as their limbs could bear, in which they were involv’d"
300,12,364,"Past breach, or loosing, that their knees might therefore be dissolv’d."
300,12,365,"Then, though a half - grey man he were, Crete’s sov’reign did excite"
300,12,366,"The Greeks to blows, and flew upon the Trojans, ev’n to flight;"
300,12,367,"For he, in sight of all the host, Othryonëus slew,"
300,12,368,"That from Cabesus, with the fame of those wars, thither drew"
300,12,369,"His new - come forces, and requir’d, without respect of dow’r,"
300,12,370,"Cassandra, fair’st of Priam’s race; assuring with his pow’r"
300,12,371,"A mighty labour, to expell, in their despite, from Troy"
300,12,372,"The sons of Greece. The king did vow, that done, he should enjoy"
300,12,373,His goodliest daughter. He (in trust of that fair purchase) fought;
300,12,374,"And at him threw the Cretan king a lance, that singled out"
300,12,375,"This great assumer, whom it strook just in his navel - stead."
300,12,376,"His brazen curets helping nought, resign’d him to the dead."
300,12,377,"Then did the conqueror exclaim, and thus insulted then:"
300,12,378,"“Othryonëus, I will praise, beyond all mortal men,"
300,12,379,"Thy living virtues, if thou wilt now perfect the brave vow"
300,12,380,"Thou mad’st to Priam, for the wife he promis’d to bestow."
300,12,381,"And where he should have kept his word, there we assure thee here,"
300,12,382,To give thee for thy princely wife the fairest and most dear
300,12,383,"Of our great Gen’ral’s female race, which from his Argive hall"
300,12,384,"We all will wait upon to Troy, if, with our aids, and all,"
300,12,385,"Thou wilt but raze this well - built town. Come, therefore, follow me,"
300,12,386,That in our ships we may conclude this royal match with thee.
300,12,387,"I’ll be no jot worse than my word.” With that he took his feet,"
300,12,388,And dragg’d him through the fervent fight; in which did Asius meet
300,12,389,"The victor, to inflict revenge. He came on foot before"
300,12,390,"His horse, that on his shoulders breath’d; so closely evermore"
300,12,391,His coachman led them to his lord; who held a huge desire
300,12,392,"To strike the king, but he strook first, and underneath his chin,"
300,12,393,"At his throat’s height, through th’ other side, his eager lance drave"
300,12,394,in;
300,12,395,"And down he bustled like an oak, a poplar, or a pine,"
300,12,396,"Hewn down for shipwood, and so lay. His fall did so decline"
300,12,397,"The spirit of his charioteer, that, lest he should incense"
300,12,398,"The victor to impair his spoil, he durst not drive from thence"
300,12,399,"His horse and chariot; and so pleas’d, with that respective part,"
300,12,400,"Antilochus, that for his fear he reach’d him with a dart"
300,12,401,"About his belly’s midst, and down his sad corse fell beneath"
300,12,402,"The richly builded chariot, there labouring out his breath."
300,12,403,"The horse Antilochus took off; when, griev’d for this event,"
300,12,404,"Deiphobus drew passing near, and at the victor sent"
300,12,405,"A shining jav’lin; which he saw, and shunn’d, with gath’ring round"
300,12,406,"His body in his all - round shield, at whose top, with a sound,"
300,12,407,"It overflew; yet, seizing there, it did not idly fly"
300,12,408,"from him that wing’d it, his strong hand still drave it mortally"
300,12,409,"On Prince Hypsenor; it did pierce his liver, underneath"
300,12,410,The veins it passeth; his shrunk knees submitted him to death.
300,12,411,And then did lov’d Deiphobus miraculously vaunt:
300,12,412,"“Now Asius lies not unreveng’d, nor doth his spirit want"
300,12,413,"The joy I wish it, though it be now ent’ring the strong gate"
300,12,414,"Of mighty Pluto, since this hand hath sent him down a mate.”"
300,12,415,"This glory in him griev’d the Greeks, and chiefly the great mind"
300,12,416,"Of martial Antilochus, who though to grief inclin’d,"
300,12,417,"He left not yet his friend, but ran and hid him with his shield;"
300,12,418,"And to him came two lovely friends, that freed him from the field,"
300,12,419,"Mecisteus, son of Echius, and the right nobly born"
300,12,420,"Alastor, bearing him to fleet, and did extremely mourn."
300,12,421,"Idomenëus sunk not yet, but held his nerves entire,"
300,12,422,"His mind much less deficient, being fed with firm desire"
300,12,423,"To hide more Trojans in dim night, or sink himself in guard"
300,12,424,Of his lov’d countrymen. And then Alcathous prepar’d
300,12,425,"Work for his valour, off’ring fate his own destructión."
300,12,426,"A great heroë, and had grace to be the lovéd son"
300,12,427,"Of Æsyetes, son - in - law to prince Æneas’ sire,"
300,12,428,Hippodamia marrying; who most enflam’d the fire
300,12,429,"Of her dear parents’ love, and took precedence in her birth"
300,12,430,"Of all their daughters, and as much exceeded in her worth"
300,12,431,"(For beauty answer’d with her mind, and both with housewif’ry)"
300,12,432,"All the fair beauty of young dames that us’d her company,"
300,12,433,"And therefore, being the worthiest dame, the worthiest man did wed"
300,12,434,Of ample Troy. Him Neptune stoop’d beneath the royal force
300,12,435,"Of Idomen, his sparkling eyes deluding, and the course"
300,12,436,"Of his illustrious lineaments so out of nature bound,"
300,12,437,"That back nor forward he could stir, but, as he grew to ground,"
300,12,438,"Stood like a pillar, or high tree, and neither mov’d, nor fear’d;"
300,12,439,"When straight the royal Cretan’s dart in his mid breast appear’d,"
300,12,440,"It brake the curets, that were proof to ev’ry other dart,"
300,12,441,Yet now they cleft and rung; the lance stuck shaking in his heart;
300,12,442,His heart with panting made it shake; but Mars did now remit
300,12,443,"The greatness of it, and the king, now quitting the brag fit"
300,12,444,"Of glory in Deiphobus, thus terribly exclaim’d:"
300,12,445,"“Deiphobus, now may we think that we are ev’nly fam’d,"
300,12,446,"That three for one have sent to Dis. But come, change blows with me,"
300,12,447,"Thy vaunts for him thou slew’st were vain. Come, wretch, that thou"
300,12,448,may’st see
300,12,449,"What issue Jove hath. Jove begot Minos, the strength of Crete;"
300,12,450,Minos begot Deucalion; Deucalion did beget
300,12,451,"Me Idomen, now Creta’s king, that here my ships have brought"
300,12,452,"To bring thyself, thy father, friends, all Ilion’s pomp, to nought.”"
300,12,453,"Deiphobus at two ways stood, in doubt to call some one,"
300,12,454,"With some retreat, to be his aid, or try the chance alone."
300,12,455,"At last, the first seem’d best to him, and back he went to call"
300,12,456,"Anchises’ son to friend, who stood in troop the last of all,"
300,12,457,"Where still he serv’d; which made him still incense against the king,"
300,12,458,"That, being amongst his best their peer, he grac’d not anything"
300,12,459,"His wrong’d deserts. Deiphobus spake to him, standing near:"
300,12,460,"“Æneas, prince of Troians, if any touch appear"
300,12,461,"Of glory in thee, thou must now assist thy sister’s lord,"
300,12,462,"And one that to thy tend’rest youth did careful guard afford,"
300,12,463,"Alcathous, whom Creta’s king hath chiefly slain to thee,"
300,12,464,"His right most challenging thy band. Come, therefore, follow me.”"
300,12,465,"This much excited his good mind, and set his heart on fire"
300,12,466,"Against the Cretan, who child - like dissolv’d not in his ire,"
300,12,467,"But stood him firm. As when in hills a strength relying boar,"
300,12,468,"Alone, and hearing hunters come, whom tumult flies before,"
300,12,469,"Up - thrusts his bristles, whets his tusks, sets fire on his red eyes,"
300,12,470,And in his brave prepar’d repulse doth dogs and men despise;
300,12,471,"So stood the famous - for - his - lance, nor shunn’d the coming charge"
300,12,472,"That resolute Æneas brought. Yet, since the odds was large,"
300,12,473,"He call’d with good right to his aid war - skill’d Ascalaphus,"
300,12,474,"Aphareüs, Meriones, the strong Deipyrus,"
300,12,475,"And Nestor’s honourable son: “Come near, my friends,” said he,"
300,12,476,"“And add your aids to me alone. Fear taints me worthily,"
300,12,477,"Though firm I stand, and show it not. Æneas great in fight,"
300,12,478,"And one that bears youth in his flow’r, that bears the greatest might,"
300,12,479,Comes on with aim direct at me. Had I his youthful limb
300,12,480,"To bear my mind, he should yield fame, or I would yield it him.”"
300,12,481,"This said, all held, in many souls, one ready helpful mind,"
300,12,482,"Clapp’d shields and shoulders, and stood close.  Æneas, not inclin’d"
300,12,483,"With more presumption than the king, call’d aid as well as he,"
300,12,484,"Divine Agenor, Helen’s love, who follow’d instantly,"
300,12,485,And all their forces following them; as after bellwethers
300,12,486,"The whole flocks follow to their drink, which sight the shepherd"
300,12,487,cheers.
300,12,488,Nor was Æneas’ joy less mov’d to see such troops attend
300,12,489,His honour’d person; and all these fought close about his friend;
300,12,490,"But two of them, past all the rest, had strong desire to shed"
300,12,491,"The blood of either; Idomen, and Cytherea’s seed."
300,12,492,"Æneas first bestow’d his lance, which th’ other seeing shunn’d,"
300,12,493,"And that, thrown from an idle hand, stuck trembling in the ground."
300,12,494,"But Idomen’s, discharg’d at him, had no such vain success,"
300,12,495,"Which Œnomaus’ entrails found, in which it did impress"
300,12,496,His sharp pile to his fall; his palms tore his returning earth.
300,12,497,"Idomenëus straight stepp’d in, and pluck’d his jav’lin forth,"
300,12,498,"But could not spoil his goodly arms, they press’d him so with darts."
300,12,499,"And now the long toil of the fight had spent his vig’rous parts,"
300,12,500,"And made them less apt to avoid the foe that should advance,"
300,12,501,"Or, when himself advanc’d again, to run and fetch his lance,"
300,12,502,And therefore in stiff fights of stand he spent the cruel day.
300,12,503,"When, coming softly from the slain, Deiphobus gave way"
300,12,504,"To his bright jav’lin at the king, whom he could never brook;"
300,12,505,But then he lost his envy too. His lance yet deadly took
300,12,506,"Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; quite through his shoulder flew"
300,12,507,"The violent head, and down he fell. Nor yet by all means knew"
300,12,508,"Wide - throated Mars his son was fall’n, but in Olympus’ top"
300,12,509,Sat canopied with golden clouds; Jove’s counsel had shut up
300,12,510,"Both him and all the other Gods from that time’s equal task,"
300,12,511,"Which now, about Ascalaphus, strife set. His shining casque"
300,12,512,"Deiphobus had forc’d from him, but instantly leap’d in"
300,12,513,"Mars - swift Meriones, and strook, with his long javelin,"
300,12,514,"The right arm of Deiphobus, which made his hand let fall"
300,12,515,The sharp - topp’d helmet; the press’d earth resounding there withal.
300,12,516,"When, vulture - like, Meriones rush’d in again and drew,"
300,12,517,"From out the low part of his arm his jav’lin, and then flew"
300,12,518,"Back to his friends. Deiphobus, faint with the blood’s excess"
300,12,519,"Fall’n from his wound, was carefully convey’d out of the press"
300,12,520,"By his kind brother by both sides, Polites, till they gat"
300,12,521,"His horse and chariot that were still set fit for his retreat,"
300,12,522,"And bore him now to Ilion. The rest fought fiercely on,"
300,12,523,"And set a mighty fight on foot. When next, Anchises’ son"
300,12,524,"Aphareus Caletorides, that ran upon him, strook"
300,12,525,Just in the throat with his keen lance; and straight his head forsook
300,12,526,"His upright carriage; and his shield, his helm, and all, with him"
300,12,527,Fell to the earth; where ruinous death made prise of ev’ry limb.
300,12,528,"Antilochus, discov’ring well that Thoon’s heart took check,"
300,12,529,"Let fly, and cut the hollow vein, that runs up to his neck,"
300,12,530,"Along his back part, quite in twain; down in the dust he fell,"
300,12,531,"Upwards, and, with extended hands, bade all the world farewell."
300,12,532,"Antilochus rush’d nimbly in, and, looking round, made prise"
300,12,533,Of his fair arms; in which affair his round - set enemies
300,12,534,"Let fly their lances, thundering on his advanced targe,"
300,12,535,But could not get his flesh. The God that shakes the earth took charge
300,12,536,"Of Nestor’s son and kept him safe; who never was away,"
300,12,537,"But still amongst the thickest foes his busy lance did play,"
300,12,538,"Observing ever when he might, far off, or near, offend;"
300,12,539,"And watching Asius’ son, in prease he spied him, and did send,"
300,12,540,"Close coming on, a dart at him, that smote in midst his shield,"
300,12,541,"In which the sharp head of the lance the blue - hair’d God made yield,"
300,12,542,Not pleas’d to yield his pupil’s life; in whose shield half the dart
300,12,543,Stuck like a truncheon burn’d with fire; on earth lay th’ other part.
300,12,544,"He, seeing no better end of all, retir’d in fear of worse"
300,12,545,But him Meriones pursu’d; and his lance found full course
300,12,546,To th’ other’s life. It wounded him betwixt the privy parts
300,12,547,"And navel, where, to wretched men that war’s most violent smarts"
300,12,548,"Must undergo, wounds chiefly vex. His dart Meriones"
300,12,549,"Pursu’d, and Adamas so striv’d with it, and his misease,"
300,12,550,"As doth a bullock puff and storm, whom in disdainéd bands"
300,12,551,"The upland herdsmen strive to cast; so, fall’n beneath the hands"
300,12,552,"Of his stern foe, Asiades did struggle, pant, and rave."
300,12,553,"But no long time; for when the lance was pluck’d out, up he gave"
300,12,554,His tortur’d soul. Then Troy’s turn came; when with a Thracian sword
300,12,555,The temples of Deipyrus did Helenus afford
300,12,556,"So huge a blow, it strook all light out of his cloudy eyes,"
300,12,557,"And cleft his helmet; which a Greek, there fighting, made his prise,"
300,12,558,It fell so full beneath his feet. Atrides griev’d to see
300,12,559,"That sight, and, threat’ning, shook a lance at Helenus, and he"
300,12,560,A bow half drew at him; at once out flew both shaft and lance.
300,12,561,The shaft Atrides’ curets strook; and far away did glance.
300,12,562,"Atrides’ dart of Helenus the thrust out bow - hand strook,"
300,12,563,"And, through the hand, stuck in the bow. Agenor’s hand did pluck"
300,12,564,From forth the nailéd prisoner the jav’lin quickly out;
300,12,565,"And fairly, with a little wool, enwrapping round about"
300,12,566,"The wounded hand, within a scarf he bore it, which his squire"
300,12,567,Had ready for him. Yet the wound would needs he should retire.
300,12,568,"Pisander, to revenge his hurt, right on the king ran he."
300,12,569,"A bloody fate suggested him to let him run on thee,"
300,12,570,"O Menelaus, that he might, by thee, in dang’rous war"
300,12,571,"Be done to death. Both coming on, Atrides’ lance did err."
300,12,572,"Pisander strook Atrides’ shield, that brake at point the dart"
300,12,573,Not running through; yet he rejoic’d as playing a victor’s part.
300,12,574,"Atrides, drawing his fair sword, upon Pisander flew;"
300,12,575,"Pisander, from beneath his shield, his goodly weapon drew,"
300,12,576,"Two - edg’d, with right sharp steel, and long, the handle olive - tree,"
300,12,577,Well - polish’d; and to blows they go. Upon the top strook he
300,12,578,"Atrides’ horse - hair’d - feather’d helm; Atrides on his brow,"
300,12,579,"Above th’ extreme part of his nose, laid such a heavy blow"
300,12,580,"That all the bones crash’d under it, and out his eyes did drop"
300,12,581,"Before his feet in bloody dust; he after, and shrunk up"
300,12,582,"His dying body, which the foot of his triumphing foe"
300,12,583,"Open’d, and stood upon his breast, and off his arms did go,"
300,12,584,"This insultation us’d the while: “At length forsake our fleet,"
300,12,585,"Thus ye false Trojans, to whom war never enough is sweet."
300,12,586,"Nor want ye more impieties, with which ye have abus’d"
300,12,587,"Me, ye bold dogs, that your chief friends so honourably us’d."
300,12,588,"Nor fear you hospitable Jove, that lets such thunders go."
300,12,589,"But build upon’t, he will unbuild your tow’rs that clamber so,"
300,12,590,"For ravishing my goods, and wife, in flow’r of all her years,"
300,12,591,"And without cause; nay, when that fair and lib’ral hand of hers"
300,12,592,Had us’d you so most lovingly. And now again ye would
300,12,593,"Cast fire into our fleet, and kill our princes if ye could."
300,12,594,"Go to, one day you will be curb’d, though never so ye thirst"
300,12,595,"Rude war, by war. O father Jove, they say thou art the first"
300,12,596,"In wisdom of all Gods and men, yet all this comes from thee,"
300,12,597,"And still thou gratifiest these men, how lewd so e’er they be,"
300,12,598,"Though never they be cloy’d with sins, nor can be satiate,"
300,12,599,"As good men should, with this vile war. Satiety of state,"
300,12,600,"Satiety of sleep and love, satiety of ease,"
300,12,601,"Of music, dancing, can find place; yet harsh war still must please"
300,12,602,"Past all these pleasures, ev’n past these. They will be cloy’d with"
300,12,603,these
300,12,604,Before their war joys. Never war gives Troy satieties.”
300,12,605,"This said, the bloody arms were oft; and to his soldiers thrown,"
300,12,606,"He mixing in first fight again. And then Harpalion,"
300,12,607,"Kind king Pylæmen’s son, gave charge; who to those wars of Troy"
300,12,608,"His lovéd father followéd, nor ever did enjoy"
300,12,609,His country’s sight again. He strook the targe of Atreus’ son
300,12,610,Full in the midst; his jav’lin’s steel yet had no pow’r to run
300,12,611,"The target through; nor had himself the heart to fetch his lance,"
300,12,612,"But took him to his strength, and cast on ev’ry side a glance,"
300,12,613,"Lest any his dear sides should dart. But Merion, as he fled,"
300,12,614,"Sent after him a brazen lance, that ran his eager head"
300,12,615,"Through his right hip, and all along the bladder’s región"
300,12,616,"Beneath the bone; it settled him, and set his spirit gone"
300,12,617,Amongst the hands of his best friends; and like a worm he lay
300,12,618,"Stretch’d on the earth, which his black blood imbru’d, and flow’d away."
300,12,619,"His corse the Paphlagonians did sadly wait upon,"
300,12,620,"Repos’d in his rich chariot, to sacred Ilion;"
300,12,621,"The king his father following, dissolv’d in kindly tears,"
300,12,622,"And no wreak sought for his slain son. But, at his slaughterers"
300,12,623,"Incenséd Paris spent a lance, since he had been a guest"
300,12,624,To many Paphlagonians; and through the prease it press’d.
300,12,625,"There was a certain augur’s son, that did for wealth excell,"
300,12,626,"And yet was honest; he was born, and did at Corinth dwell;"
300,12,627,"Who, though he knew his harmful fate, would needs his ship ascend."
300,12,628,"His father, Polyidus, oft would tell him that his end"
300,12,629,"Would either seize him at his house, upon a sharp disease,"
300,12,630,Or else among the Grecian ships by Trojans slain. Both these
300,12,631,"Together he desir’d to shun; but the disease, at last,"
300,12,632,"And ling’ring death in it, he left, and war’s quick stroke embrac’d."
300,12,633,"The lance betwixt his ear and cheek ran in, and drave the mind"
300,12,634,Of both those bitter fortunes out. Night strook his whole pow’rs blind.
300,12,635,"Thus fought they, like the spirit of fire; nor Jove - lov’d Hector knew"
300,12,636,How in the fleet’s left wing the Greeks his down - put soldiers slew
300,12,637,Almost to victory; the God that shakes the earth so well
300,12,638,"Help’d with his own strength, and the Greeks so fiercely did impel."
300,12,639,"Yet Hector made the first place good, where both the ports and wall"
300,12,640,"(The thick rank of the Greek shields broke) he enter’d, and did skall,"
300,12,641,Where on the gray sea’s shore were drawn (the wall being there but
300,12,642,slight)
300,12,643,"Protesilaus’ ships, and those of Ajax, where the fight"
300,12,644,"Of men and horse were sharpest set. There the Bœotian bands,"
300,12,645,"Long - rob’d Iaons, Locrians, and, brave men of their hands,"
300,12,646,The Phthian and Epeian troops did spritefully assail
300,12,647,The god - like Hector rushing in; and yet could not prevail
300,12,648,"To his repulse, though choicest men of Athens there made head;"
300,12,649,"Amongst whom was Menestheus chief, whom Phidias followéd,"
300,12,650,"Stichius and Bias, huge in strength. Th’ Epeian troops were led"
300,12,651,"By Meges’ and Phylides’ cares, Amphion, Dracius."
300,12,652,"Before the Phthians Medon march’d, and Meneptolemus;"
300,12,653,"And these, with the Bœotian pow’rs, bore up the fleet’s defence."
300,12,654,"Oïleus by his brother’s side stood close, and would not thence"
300,12,655,"For any moment of that time. But, as through fallow fields"
300,12,656,"Black oxen draw a well - join’d plough, and either ev’nly yields"
300,12,657,"His thrifty labour, all heads couch’d so close to earth they plow"
300,12,658,"The fallow with their horns, till out the sweat begins to flow,"
300,12,659,"The stretch’d yokes crack, and yet at last the furrow forth is driven;"
300,12,660,"So toughly stood these to their task, and made their work as even."
300,12,661,But Ajax Telamonius had many helpful men
300,12,662,"That, when sweat ran about his knees, and labour flow’d, would then"
300,12,663,Help bear his mighty sev’n - fold shield; when swift Oïliades
300,12,664,"The Locrians left, and would not make those murth’rous fights of"
300,12,665,"prease,"
300,12,666,"Because they wore no bright steel casques, nor bristled plumes for"
300,12,667,"show,"
300,12,668,"Round shields, nor darts of solid ash, but with the trusty bow,"
300,12,669,"And jacks well - quilted with soft wool, they came to Troy, and were,"
300,12,670,"In their fit place, as confident as those that fought so near,"
300,12,671,"And reach’d their foes so thick with shafts, that these were they that"
300,12,672,brake
300,12,673,"The Trojan orders first; and then, the brave arm’d men did make"
300,12,674,"Good work with their close fights before. Behind whom, having shot,"
300,12,675,The Locrians hid still; and their foes all thought of fight forgot
300,12,676,"With shows of those far - striking shafts, their eyes were troubled so."
300,12,677,"And then, assur’dly, from the ships, and tents, th’ insulting foe"
300,12,678,"Had miserably fled to Troy, had not Polydamas"
300,12,679,"Thus spake to Hector: “Hector, still impossible ’tis to pass"
300,12,680,"Good counsel upon you. But say some God prefers thy deeds,"
300,12,681,In counsels wouldst thou pass us too? In all things none exceeds.
300,12,682,"To some God gives the pow’r of war, to some the sleight to dance,"
300,12,683,"To some the art of instruments, some doth for voice advance;"
300,12,684,"And that far - seeing God grants some the wisdom of the mind,"
300,12,685,"Which no man can keep to himself, that, though but few can find,"
300,12,686,"Doth profit many, that preserves the public weal and state,"
300,12,687,"And that, who hath, he best can prize. But, for me, I’ll relate"
300,12,688,Only my censure what’s our best. The very crown of war
300,12,689,"Doth burn about thee; yet our men, when they have reach’d thus far,"
300,12,690,"Suppose their valours crown’d, and cease. A few still stir their feet,"
300,12,691,"And so a few with many fight, sperst thinly through the fleet."
300,12,692,"Retire then, leave speech to the rout, and all thy princes call,"
300,12,693,"That, here, in counsels of most weight, we may resolve of all,"
300,12,694,"If having likelihood to believe that God will conquest give,"
300,12,695,"We shall charge through; or with this grace, make our retreat, and"
300,12,696,live.
300,12,697,"For, I must needs affirm, I fear, the debt of yesterday"
300,12,698,(Since war is such a God of change) the Grecians now will pay.
300,12,699,"And since th’ insatiate man of war remains at fleet, if there"
300,12,700,"We tempt his safety, no hour more his hot soul can forbear.”"
300,12,701,"This sound stuff Hector lik’d, approv’d, jump’d from his chariot,"
300,12,702,"And said: “Polydamas make good this place, and suffer not"
300,12,703,"One prince to pass it; I myself will there go, where you see"
300,12,704,"Those friends in skirmish, and return (when they have heard from me"
300,12,705,"Command that your advice obeys) with utmost speed.” This said,"
300,12,706,"With day - bright arms, white plume, white scarf, his goodly limbs"
300,12,707,"array’d,"
300,12,708,"He parted from them, like a hill, removing, all of snow,"
300,12,709,"And to the Trojan peers and chiefs he flew, to let them know"
300,12,710,"The counsel of Polydamas. All turn’d, and did rejoice,"
300,12,711,"To haste to Panthus’ gentle son, being call’d by Hector’s voice;"
300,12,712,"Who, through the forefights making way, look’d for Deiphobus,"
300,12,713,"King Helenus, Asiades, Hyrtasian Asius,"
300,12,714,"Of whom, some were not to be found unhurt, or undeceas’d,"
300,12,715,"Some only hurt, and gone from field. As further he address’d,"
300,12,716,He found within the fight’s left wing the fair - hair’d Helen’s love
300,12,717,By all means moving men to blows; which could by no means move
300,12,718,"Hector’s forbearance, his friends’ miss so put his pow’rs in storm,"
300,12,719,"But thus in wonted terms he chid: “You with the finest form,"
300,12,720,"Impostor, woman’s man! where are, in your care mark’d, all these,"
300,12,721,"Deiphobus, King Helenus, Asius Hyrtacides,"
300,12,722,Othryonëus Acamas? Now haughty Ilion
300,12,723,Shakes to his lowest groundwork. Now just ruin falls upon
300,12,724,"Thy head past rescue.” He replied: “Hector, why chid’st thou now,"
300,12,725,"When I am guiltless? Other times, there are for ease, I know,"
300,12,726,"Than these, for she that brought thee forth, not utterly left me"
300,12,727,"Without some portion of thy spirit, to make me brother thee."
300,12,728,"But since thou first brought’st in thy force, to this our naval fight,"
300,12,729,"I and my friends have ceaseless fought, to do thy service right."
300,12,730,"But all those friends thou seek’st are slain; excepting Helenus,"
300,12,731,"Who parted wounded in his hand, and so Deiphobus;"
300,12,732,Jove yet averted death from them. And now lead thou as far
300,12,733,"As thy great heart affects, all we will second any war"
300,12,734,"That thou endurest; and I hope, my own strength is not lost;"
300,12,735,"Though least, I’ll fight it to his best; nor further fights the most.”"
300,12,736,This calm’d hot Hector’s spleen; and both turn’d where they saw the
300,12,737,face
300,12,738,"Of war most fierce, and that was where their friends made good the"
300,12,739,place
300,12,740,"About renown’d Polydamas, and god - like Polypæt,"
300,12,741,"Palmus, Ascanius, Morus that Hippotion did beget,"
300,12,742,And from Ascania’s wealthy fields but ev’n the day before
300,12,743,"Arriv’d at Troy, that with their aid they kindly might restore"
300,12,744,Some kindness they receiv’d from thence. And in fierce fight with
300,12,745,"these,"
300,12,746,"Phalces and tall Orthæus stood, and bold Cebriones."
300,12,747,"And then the doubt that in advice Polydamas disclos’d,"
300,12,748,"To fight or fly, Jove took away, and all to fight dispos’d."
300,12,749,And as the floods of troubled air to pitchy storms increase
300,12,750,"That after thunder sweeps the fields, and ravish up the seas,"
300,12,751,"Encount’ring with abhorréd roars, when the engrosséd waves"
300,12,752,"Boil into foam, and endlessly one after other raves;"
300,12,753,"So rank’d and guarded th’ Ilians march’d; some now, more now, and then"
300,12,754,"More upon more, in shining steel; now captains, then their men."
300,12,755,"And Hector, like man - killing Mars, advanc’d before them all,"
300,12,756,"His huge round target before him, through thicken’d, like a wall."
300,12,757,With hides well - couch’d with store of brass; and on his temples shin’d
300,12,758,"His bright helm, on which danc’d his plume; and in this horrid kind,"
300,12,759,(All hid within his world - like shield) he ev’ry troop assay’d
300,12,760,"For entry, that in his despite stood firm and undismay’d."
300,12,761,"Which when he saw, and kept more off, Ajax came stalking then,"
300,12,762,"And thus provok’d him: “O good man, why fright’st thou thus our men?"
300,12,763,"Come nearer. Not art’s want in war makes us thus navy - bound,"
300,12,764,But Jove’s direct scourge; his arm’d hand makes our hands give you
300,12,765,ground.
300,12,766,"Yet thou hop’st, of thyself, our spoil. But we have likewise hands"
300,12,767,"To hold our own, as you to spoil; and ere thy countermands"
300,12,768,"Stand good against our ransack’d fleet, your hugely - peopled town"
300,12,769,"Our hands shall take in, and her tow’rs from all their heights pull"
300,12,770,down.
300,12,771,"And I must tell thee, time draws on, when, flying, thou shalt cry"
300,12,772,To Jove and all the Gods to make thy fair - man’d horses fly
300,12,773,"More swift than falcons, that their hoofs may rouse the dust, and bear"
300,12,774,"Thy body, hid, to Ilion.” This said, his bold words were"
300,12,775,"Confirm’d as soon as spoke. Jove’s bird, the high - flown eagle, took"
300,12,776,The right hand of their host; whose wings high acclamations strook
300,12,777,From forth the glad breasts of the Greeks. Then Hector made reply:
300,12,778,"“Vain - spoken man, and glorious, what hast thou said? Would I"
300,12,779,"As surely were the son of Jove, and of great Juno born,"
300,12,780,"Adorn’d like Pallas, and the God that lifts to earth the morn,"
300,12,781,"As this day shall bring harmful light to all your host, and thou,"
300,12,782,"If thou dar’st stand this lance, the earth before the ships shalt"
300,12,783,"strow,"
300,12,784,"Thy bosom torn up, and the dogs, with all the fowl of Troy,"
300,12,785,"Be satiate with thy fat and flesh.” This said, with shouting joy"
300,12,786,"His first troops follow’d, and the last their shouts with shouts"
300,12,787,repell’d.
300,12,788,"Greece answer’d all, nor could her spirits from all show rest"
300,12,789,conceal’d.
300,12,790,"And to so infinite a height all acclamations strove,"
300,12,791,They reach’d the splendours stuck about the unreach’d throne of Jove.
300,12,792,THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH BOOK.
300,12,793,[1] The empire of Jove exceeded Neptune’s (saith Plut. upon this
300,12,794,"place) because he was more ancient, and excellent in knowledge and"
300,12,795,"wisdom; and upon this verse, viz. ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς πρότερος, etc., sets down"
300,12,796,this his most worthy to be noted opinion: viz. I think also that the
300,12,797,"blessedness of eternal life, which God enjoys is this: that by any"
300,12,798,"past time He forgets not notions presently apprehended; for otherwise,"
300,12,799,"the knowledge and understanding of things taken away, immortality"
300,12,800,"should not be life, but time, etc. (Plut. de Iside et Osiride)."
300,13,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,13,2,"Atrides, to behold the skirmish, brings"
300,13,3,"Old Nestor, and the other wounded kings."
300,13,4,Juno (receiving of the Cyprian dame
300,13,5,"Her Ceston, whence her sweet enticements came)"
300,13,6,"Descends to Somnus, and gets him to bind"
300,13,7,"The pow’rs of Jove with sleep, to free her mind."
300,13,8,"Neptune assists the Greeks, and of the foe"
300,13,9,Slaughter inflicts a mighty overthrow.
300,13,10,"Ajax so sore strikes Hector with a stone,"
300,13,11,"It makes him spit blood, and his sense sets gone."
300,13,12,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,13,13,"In Ξ with sleep, and bed, heav’n’s Queen"
300,13,14,Ev’n Jove himself makes overseen.
300,13,15,"Not wine, nor feasts, could lay their soft chains on old Nestor’s ear"
300,13,16,"To this high clamour, who requir’d Machaon’s thoughts to bear"
300,13,17,"His care in part, about the cause; “For, methink, still,” said he,"
300,13,18,"“The cry increases. I must needs the watchtow’r mount, to see"
300,13,19,"Which way the flood of war doth drive. Still drink thou wine, and eat,"
300,13,20,Till fair - hair’d Hecamed hath giv’n a little water heat
300,13,21,"To cleanse the quitture from thy wound.” This said, the goodly shield"
300,13,22,"Of warlike Thrasymed, his son, who had his own in field,"
300,13,23,"He took, snatch’d up a mighty lance, and so stept forth to view"
300,13,24,"Cause of that clamour. Instantly th’ unworthy cause he knew,"
300,13,25,"The Grecians wholly put in rout, the Trojans routing still,"
300,13,26,"Close at the Greeks’ backs, their wall raz’d. The old man mourn’d this"
300,13,27,ill;
300,13,28,"And, as when with unwieldy waves the great sea fore - feels winds"
300,13,29,"That both ways murmur, and no way her certain current finds,"
300,13,30,"But pants and swells confusedly, here goes, and there will stay,"
300,13,31,"Till on it air casts one firm wind, and then it rolls away;"
300,13,32,"So stood old Nestor in debate, two thoughts at once on wing"
300,13,33,"In his discourse, if first to take direct course to the king,"
300,13,34,Or to the multitude in fight. At last he did conclude
300,13,35,To visit Agamemnon first. Mean time both hosts imbrued
300,13,36,"Their steel in one another’s blood, nought wrought their healths but"
300,13,37,"harms,"
300,13,38,"Swords, huge stones, double - headed darts, still thumping on their arms."
300,13,39,"And now the Jove - kept kings, whose wounds were yet in cure, did meet"
300,13,40,"Old Nestor, Diomed, Ithacus, and Atreus’ sons, from fleet"
300,13,41,"Bent for the fight which was far off, the ships being drawn to shore"
300,13,42,"On heaps at first, till all their sterns a wall was rais’d before,"
300,13,43,"Which, though not great, it yet suffic’d to hide them, though their men"
300,13,44,"Were something straited; for whose scope, in form of battle then,"
300,13,45,"They drew them through the spacious shore, one by another still,"
300,13,46,"Till all the bosom of the strand their sable bulks did fill,"
300,13,47,Ev’n till they took up all the space ’twixt both the promont’ries.
300,13,48,"These kings, like Nestor, in desire to know for what those cries"
300,13,49,"Became so violent, came along, all leaning on their darts,"
300,13,50,"To see, though not of pow’r to fight, sad and suspicious hearts"
300,13,51,"Distemp’ring them; and, meeting now Nestor, the king in fear"
300,13,52,"Cried out: “O Nestor our renown! Why shows thy presence here,"
300,13,53,The harmful fight abandoned? Now Hector will make good
300,13,54,"The threat’ning vow he made, I fear, that, till he had our blood,"
300,13,55,"And fir’d our fleet, he never more would turn to Ilion."
300,13,56,"Nor is it long, I see, before his whole will will be done."
300,13,57,O Gods! I now see all the Greeks put on Achilles’ ire
300,13,58,Against my honour; no mean left to keep our fleet from fire.”
300,13,59,"He answer’d: “’Tis an evident truth, not Jove himself can now,"
300,13,60,"With all the thunder in his hands, prevent our overthrow."
300,13,61,"The wall we thought invincible, and trusted more than Jove,"
300,13,62,"Is scal’d, raz’d, enter’d; and our pow’rs (driv’n up) past breathing,"
300,13,63,prove
300,13,64,"A most inevitable fight; both slaughters so commix’d,"
300,13,65,That for your life you cannot put your diligent’st thought betwixt
300,13,66,"The Greeks and Trojans, and as close their throats cleave to the sky."
300,13,67,"Consult we then, if that will serve. For fight advise not I;"
300,13,68,It fits not wounded men to fight.” Atrides answer’d him:
300,13,69,"“If such a wall as cost the Greeks so many a tiréd limb,"
300,13,70,"And such a dike be pass’d, and raz’d, that, as yourself said well,"
300,13,71,"We all esteem’d invincible, and would past doubt repell"
300,13,72,The world from both our fleet and us; it doth directly show
300,13,73,That here Jove vows our shames and deaths. I evermore did know
300,13,74,"His hand from ours when he help’d us, and now I see as clear"
300,13,75,"That, like the blesséd Gods, he holds our hated enemies dear,"
300,13,76,"Supports their arms, and pinions ours. Conclude then, ’tis in vain"
300,13,77,"To strive with him. Our ships drawn up, now let us launch again,"
300,13,78,"And keep at anchor till calm night, that then, perhaps, our foes"
300,13,79,"May calm their storms, and in that time our scape we may dispose."
300,13,80,"‘It is not any shame to fly from ill, although by night."
300,13,81,"Known ill he better does that flies, than he it takes in fight.’”"
300,13,82,"Ulysses frown’d on him, and said: “Accurs’d, why talk’st thou thus?"
300,13,83,"Would thou hadst led some barb’rous host, and not commanded us"
300,13,84,"Whom Jove made soldiers from our youth, that age might scorn to fly"
300,13,85,"From any charge it undertakes, and ev’ry dazzled eye"
300,13,86,The honour’d hand of war might close. Thus wouldst thou leave this
300,13,87,"town,"
300,13,88,For which our many mis’ries felt entitle it our own?
300,13,89,"Peace, lest some other Greek give ear, and hear a sentence such;"
300,13,90,As no man’s palate should profane; at least that knew how much
300,13,91,"His own right weigh’d, and being a prince, and such a prince as bears"
300,13,92,"Rule of so many Greeks as thou. This counsel loathes mine ears,"
300,13,93,"Let others toil in fight and cries, and we so light of heels"
300,13,94,"Upon their very noise, and groans, to hoise away our keels."
300,13,95,"Thus we should fit the wish of Troy, that, being something near"
300,13,96,"The victory, we give it clear; and we were sure to bear"
300,13,97,"A slaughter to the utmost man, for no man will sustain"
300,13,98,"A stroke, the fleet gone, but at that, look still, and wish him slain."
300,13,99,"And therefore, prince of men, be sure, thy censure is unfit.”"
300,13,100,"“O Ithacus,” replied the king, “thy bitter terms have smit"
300,13,101,"My heart in sunder. At no hand, ’gainst any prince’s will"
300,13,102,"Do I command this. Would to God, that any man of skill"
300,13,103,"To give a better counsel would, or old, or younger man!"
300,13,104,My voice should gladly go with his.” Then Diomed began:
300,13,105,"“The man not far is, nor shall ask much labour to bring in,"
300,13,106,"That willingly would speak his thoughts, if spoken they might win"
300,13,107,"Fit ear, and suffer no impair, that I discover them,"
300,13,108,"Being youngest of you; since my sire, that heir’d a diadem,"
300,13,109,"May make my speech to diadems decent enough, though he"
300,13,110,Lies in his sepulchre at Thebes. I boast this pedigree:
300,13,111,"Portheus three famous sons begot, that in high Calydon"
300,13,112,"And Pleuron kept, with state of kings, their habitatión;"
300,13,113,"Agrius, Melas, and the third the horseman Oeneus,"
300,13,114,"My father’s father, that excell’d in actions generous"
300,13,115,"The other two. But these kept home, my father being driv’n"
300,13,116,"With wand’ring and advent’rous spirits, for so the King of heav’n"
300,13,117,"And th’ other Gods set down their wills, and he to Argos came,"
300,13,118,"Where he begun the world, and dwelt. There marrying a dame,"
300,13,119,"One of Adrastus’ female race, he kept a royal house,"
300,13,120,"For he had great demesnes, good land, and, being industrious,"
300,13,121,"He planted many orchard - grounds about his house, and bred"
300,13,122,"Great store of sheep. Besides all this, he was well qualitied,"
300,13,123,"And pass’d all Argives, for his spear. And these digressive things"
300,13,124,"Are such as you may well endure, since (being deriv’d from kings,"
300,13,125,"And kings not poor nor virtueless) you cannot hold me base,"
300,13,126,"Nor scorn my words, which oft, though true, in mean men meet disgrace."
300,13,127,"However, they are these in short: Let us be seen at fight,"
300,13,128,"And yield to strong necessity, though wounded, that our sight"
300,13,129,"May set those men on that, of late, have to Achilles’ spleen"
300,13,130,"Been too indulgent, and left blows; but be we only seen,"
300,13,131,"Not come within the reach of darts, lest wound on wound we lay;"
300,13,132,"Which rev’rend Nestor’s speech implied, and so far him obey.”"
300,13,133,"This counsel gladly all observ’d, went on, Atrides led."
300,13,134,"Nor Neptune this advantage lost, but closely followéd,"
300,13,135,And like an aged man appear’d t’ Atrides; whose right hand
300,13,136,"He seiz’d, and said: “Atrides, this doth passing fitly stand"
300,13,137,"With stern Achilles’ wreakful spirit, that he can stand astern"
300,13,138,"His ship, and both in fight and death the Grecian bane discern,"
300,13,139,Since not in his breast glows one spark of any human mind.
300,13,140,But be that his own bane. Let God by that loss make him find
300,13,141,"How vile a thing he is. For know, the blest Gods have not giv’n"
300,13,142,"Thee ever over, but perhaps the Trojans may from heav’n"
300,13,143,"Receive that justice. Nay, ’tis sure, and thou shalt see their falls,"
300,13,144,"Your fleet soon freed, and for fights here they glad to take their"
300,13,145,walls.”
300,13,146,"This said, he made known who he was, and parted with a cry"
300,13,147,"As if ten thousand men had join’d in battle then, so high"
300,13,148,His throat flew through the host; and so this great Earth - shaking God
300,13,149,"Cheer’d up the Greek hearts, that they wish their pains no period."
300,13,150,"Saturnia from Olympus’ top saw her great brother there,"
300,13,151,"And her great husband’s brother too, exciting ev’rywhere"
300,13,152,"The glorious spirits of the Greeks; which as she joy’d to see,"
300,13,153,"So, on the fountful Ida’s top, Jove’s sight did disagree"
300,13,154,"With her contentment, since she fear’d that his hand would descend,"
300,13,155,And check the Sea - god’s practices. And this she did contend
300,13,156,"How to prevent, which thus seem’d best: To deck her curiously,"
300,13,157,"And visit the Idalian hill, that so the Lightner’s eye"
300,13,158,"She might enamour with her looks, and his high temples steep,"
300,13,159,"Ev’n to his wisdom, in the kind and golden juice of sleep."
300,13,160,"So took she chamber, which her son, the God of ferrary,"
300,13,161,"With firm doors made, being joinèd close, and with a privy key"
300,13,162,"That no God could command but Jove; where, enter’d, she made fast"
300,13,163,"The shining gates, and then upon her lovely body cast"
300,13,164,"Ambrosia, that first made it clear, and after laid on it"
300,13,165,"An od’rous, rich, and sacred oil, that was so wond’rous sweet"
300,13,166,"That ever, when it was but touch’d, it sweeten’d heav’n and earth."
300,13,167,"Her body being cleans’d with this, her tresses she let forth,"
300,13,168,"And comb’d, her comb dipp’d in the oil, then wrapp’d them up in curls;"
300,13,169,"And, thus her deathless head adorn’d, a heav’nly veil she hurls"
300,13,170,"On her white shoulders, wrought by Her that rules in housewif’ries,"
300,13,171,"Who wove it full of antique works, of most divine device;"
300,13,172,And this with goodly clasps of gold she fasten’d to her breast.
300,13,173,"Then with a girdle, whose rich sphere a hundred studs impress’d,"
300,13,174,"She girt her small waist. In her ears, tenderly pierc’d, she wore"
300,13,175,"Pearls, great and orient. On her head, a wreath not worn before"
300,13,176,"Cast beams out like the sun. At last, she to her feet did tie"
300,13,177,"Fair shoes. And thus entire attir’d, she shin’d in open sky,"
300,13,178,"Call’d the fair Paphian Queen apart from th’ other Gods, and said:"
300,13,179,"“Lov’d daughter! Should I ask a grace, should I, or be obey’d?"
300,13,180,"Or wouldst thou cross me, being incens’d, since I cross thee and take"
300,13,181,"The Greeks’ part, thy hand helping Troy?” She answer’d, “That shall"
300,13,182,make
300,13,183,"No diff’rence in a diff’rent cause. Ask, ancient Deity,"
300,13,184,What most contents thee. My mind stands inclin’d as liberally
300,13,185,To grant it as thine own to ask; provided that it be
300,13,186,"A favour fit and in my pow’r.” She, giv’n deceitfully,"
300,13,187,"Thus said: “Then give me those two pow’rs, with which both men and Gods"
300,13,188,"Thou vanquishest, Love and Desire; for now the periods"
300,13,189,"Of all the many - feeding earth, and the original"
300,13,190,"Of all the Gods, Oceanus, and Thetis whom we call"
300,13,191,"Our Mother, I am going to greet. They nurst me in their court,"
300,13,192,"And brought me up, receiving me in most respectful sort"
300,13,193,"From Phæa, when Jove under earth and the unfruitful seas"
300,13,194,"Cast Saturn. These I go to see, intending to appease"
300,13,195,"Jars grown betwixt them, having long abstain’d from speech and bed;"
300,13,196,"Which jars, could I so reconcile, that in their anger’s stead"
300,13,197,"I could place love, and so renew their first society,"
300,13,198,"I should their best lov’d be esteem’d, and honour’d endlessly.”"
300,13,199,"She answer’d: “’Tis not fit, nor just, thy will should be denied,"
300,13,200,"Whom Jove in his embraces holds.” This spoken, she untied,"
300,13,201,"And from her od’rous bosom took, her Ceston, in whose sphere"
300,13,202,"Were all enticements to delight, all loves, all longings were,"
300,13,203,"Kind conference, fair speech, whose pow’r the wisest doth inflame."
300,13,204,"This she resigning to her hands, thus urg’d her by her name:"
300,13,205,"“Receive this bridle, thus fair - wrought, and put it ’twixt thy breasts,"
300,13,206,Where all things to be done are done; and whatsoever rests
300,13,207,"In thy desire return with it.” The great - ey’d Juno smil’d,"
300,13,208,"And put it ’twixt her breasts. Love’s Queen, thus cunningly beguil’d,"
300,13,209,"To Jove’s court flew. Saturnia, straight stooping from heav’n’s height,"
300,13,210,"Pieria and Emathia, those countries of delight,"
300,13,211,"Soon reach’d, and to the snowy mounts, where Thracian soldiers dwell,"
300,13,212,"Approaching, pass’d their tops untouch’d. From Athos then she fell,"
300,13,213,"Pass’d all the broad sea, and arriv’d in Lemnos, at the tow’rs"
300,13,214,"Of godlike Thoas, where she met the Prince of all men’s pow’rs,"
300,13,215,"Death’s brother, Sleep; whose hand she took, and said: “Thou king of"
300,13,216,"men,"
300,13,217,"Prince of the Gods too, if before thou heard’st my suits, again"
300,13,218,"Give helpful ear, and through all times I’ll offer thanks to thee."
300,13,219,"Lay slumber on Jove’s fi’ry eyes, that I may comfort me"
300,13,220,With his embraces; for which grace I’ll grace thee with a throne
300,13,221,"Incorruptible, all of gold, and elegantly done"
300,13,222,"By Mulciber, to which he forg’d a footstool for the ease"
300,13,223,"Of thy soft feet, when wine and feasts thy golden humours please.”"
300,13,224,"Sweet Sleep replied: “Satunia, there lives not any God,"
300,13,225,"Besides Jove, but I would becalm; aye if it were the Flood,"
300,13,226,"That fathers all the Deities, the great Oceanus;"
300,13,227,"But Jove we dare not come more near, than he commandeth us."
300,13,228,"Now you command me as you did, when Jove’s great - minded son,"
300,13,229,"Alcides, having sack’d the town of stubborn Ilion,"
300,13,230,Took sail from thence; when by your charge I pour’d about Jove’s mind
300,13,231,"A pleasing slumber, calming him, till thou drav’st up the wind,"
300,13,232,"In all his cruelties, to sea, that set his son ashore"
300,13,233,"In Cous, far from all his friends. Which, waking, vex’d so sore"
300,13,234,"The supreme Godhead, that he cast the Gods about the sky,"
300,13,235,"And me, above them all, he sought, whom he had utterly"
300,13,236,"Hurl’d from the sparkling firmament, if all - gods - taming Night"
300,13,237,"(Whom, flying, I besought for aid) had suffer’d his despite,"
300,13,238,"And not preserv’d me; but his wrath with my offence dispens’d,"
300,13,239,"For fear t’ offend her, and so ceas’d, though never so incens’d."
300,13,240,"And now another such escape, you wish I should prepare.”"
300,13,241,She answer’d: “What hath thy deep rest to do with his deep care?
300,13,242,As though Jove’s love to Ilion in all degrees were such
300,13,243,"As ’twas to Hercules his son, and so would storm as much"
300,13,244,"For their displeasure as for his? Away, I will remove"
300,13,245,"Thy fear with giving thee the dame, that thou didst ever love,"
300,13,246,"One of the fair young Graces born, divine Pasithae.”"
300,13,247,"This started Somnus into joy, who answer’d: “Swear to me,"
300,13,248,"By those inviolable springs, that feed the Stygian lake,"
300,13,249,"With one hand touch the nourishing earth, and in the other take"
300,13,250,"The marble sea, that all the Gods, of the infernal state,"
300,13,251,"Which circle Saturn, may to us be witnesses, and rate"
300,13,252,"What thou hast vow’d; That with all truth, thou wilt bestow on me,"
300,13,253,"The dame I grant I ever lov’d, divine Pasithae.”"
300,13,254,"She swore, as he enjoin’d, in all, and strengthen’d all his joys"
300,13,255,"By naming all th’ infernal Gods, surnam’d the Titanois."
300,13,256,"The oath thus taken, both took way, and made their quick repair"
300,13,257,"To Ida from the town, and isle, all hid in liquid air."
300,13,258,"At Lecton first they left the sea, and there the land they trod;"
300,13,259,"The fountful nurse of savages, with all her woods, did nod"
300,13,260,"Beneath their feet; there Somnus stay’d, lest Jove’s bright eye should"
300,13,261,"see,"
300,13,262,"And yet, that he might see to Jove, he climb’d the goodliest tree"
300,13,263,"That all th’ Idalian mountain bred, and crown’d her progeny,"
300,13,264,"A fir it was, that shot past air, and kiss’d the burning sky;"
300,13,265,"There sate he hid in his dark arms, and in the shape with all"
300,13,266,"Of that continual prating bird, whom all the Deities call"
300,13,267,"Chalcis, but men Cymmindis name. Saturnia tripp’d apace,"
300,13,268,"Up to the top of Gargarus, and show’d her heav’nly face"
300,13,269,"To Jupiter, who saw, and lov’d, and with as hot a fire,"
300,13,270,"Being curious in her tempting view, as when with first desire"
300,13,271,(The pleasure of it being stol’n) they mix’d in love and bed;
300,13,272,"And, gazing on her still, he said: “Saturnia, what hath bred"
300,13,273,"This haste in thee from our high court, and whither tends thy gait,"
300,13,274,"That void of horse and chariot, fit for thy sov’reign state,"
300,13,275,Thou lackiest here?” Her studied fraud replied: “My journey now
300,13,276,Leaves state and labours to do good; and where in right I owe
300,13,277,"All kindness to the Sire of Gods, and our good Mother Queen"
300,13,278,That nurst and kept me curiously in court (since both have been
300,13,279,Long time at discord) my desire is to atone their hearts;
300,13,280,And therefore go I now to see those earth’s extremest parts.
300,13,281,"For whose far - seat I spar’d my horse the scaling of this hill,"
300,13,282,And left them at the foot of it; for they must taste their fill
300,13,283,"Of travail with me, and must draw my coach through earth and seas,"
300,13,284,"Whose far - intended reach, respect, and care not to displease"
300,13,285,"Thy graces, made me not attempt, without thy gracious leave.”"
300,13,286,The cloud - compelling God her guile in this sort did receive:
300,13,287,"“Juno, thou shalt have after leave, but, ere so far thou stray,"
300,13,288,"Convert we our kind thoughts to love, that now doth ev’ry way"
300,13,289,"Circle with victory my pow’rs, nor yet with any dame,"
300,13,290,"Woman, or Goddess, did his fires my bosom so inflame"
300,13,291,As now with thee. Not when it lov’d the parts so generous
300,13,292,"Ixion’s wife had, that brought forth the wise Pirithous;"
300,13,293,Nor when the lovely dame Acrisius’ daughter stirr’d
300,13,294,"My amorous pow’rs, that Perseus bore to all men else preferr’d;"
300,13,295,"Nor when the dame, that Phenix got, surpris’d me with her sight,"
300,13,296,Who the divine - soul’d Rhadamanth and Minos brought to light;
300,13,297,"Nor Semele, that bore to me the joy of mortal men,"
300,13,298,"The sprightly Bacchus; nor the dame that Thebes renownéd then,"
300,13,299,"Alcmena, that bore Hercules; Latona, so renown’d;"
300,13,300,"Queen Ceres, with the golden hair; nor thy fair eyes did wound"
300,13,301,My entrails to such depth as now with thirst of amorous ease.”
300,13,302,"The cunning Dame seem’d much incens’d, and said: “What words are these,"
300,13,303,Unsufferable Saturn’s son? What! Here! In Ida’s height!
300,13,304,Desir’st thou this? How fits it us? Or what if in the sight
300,13,305,"Of any God thy will were pleas’d, that he the rest might bring"
300,13,306,To witness thy incontinence? ’Twere a dishonour’d thing.
300,13,307,"I would not show my face in heav’n, and rise from such a bed."
300,13,308,"But, if love be so dear to thee, thou hast a chamberstead,"
300,13,309,Which Vulcan purposely contriv’d with all fit secrecy;
300,13,310,There sleep at pleasure.” He replied: “I fear not if the eye
300,13,311,"Of either God or man observe, so thick a cloud of gold"
300,13,312,"I’ll cast about us that the sun, who furthest can behold,"
300,13,313,"Shall never find us.” This resolv’d, into his kind embrace"
300,13,314,He took his wife. Beneath them both fair Tellus strew’d the place
300,13,315,"With fresh - sprung herbs, so soft and thick that up aloft it bore"
300,13,316,"Their heav’nly bodies; with his leaves, did dewy lotus store"
300,13,317,Th’ Elysian mountain; saffron flow’rs and hyacinths help’d make
300,13,318,The sacred bed; and there they slept. When suddenly there brake
300,13,319,"A golden vapour out of air, whence shining dews did fall,"
300,13,320,"In which they wrapt them close, and slept till Jove was tam’d withal."
300,13,321,"Mean space flew Somnus to the ships, found Neptune out, and said:"
300,13,322,"“Now cheerfully assist the Greeks; and give them glorious head,"
300,13,323,"At least a little, while Jove sleeps; of whom through ev’ry limb"
300,13,324,"I pour’d dark sleep, Saturnia’s love hath so illuded him.”"
300,13,325,"This news made Neptune more secure in giving Grecians heart,"
300,13,326,And through the first fights thus he stirr’d the men of most desert:
300,13,327,"“Yet, Grecians, shall we put our ships, and conquest, in the hands"
300,13,328,"Of Priam’s Hector by our sloth? He thinks so, and commands"
300,13,329,"With pride according; all because, Achilles keeps away."
300,13,330,"Alas, as we were nought but him! We little need to stay"
300,13,331,"On his assistance, if we would our own strengths call to field,"
300,13,332,"And mutually maintain repulse. Come on then, all men yield"
300,13,333,"To what I order. We that bear best arms in all our hosts,"
300,13,334,"Whose heads sustain the brightest helms, whose hands are bristled most"
300,13,335,"With longest lances, let us on. But stay, I’ll lead you all;"
300,13,336,"Nor think I but great Hector’s spirits will suffer some appall,"
300,13,337,"Though they be never so inspir’d. The ablest of us then,"
300,13,338,"That on our shoulders worst shields bear, exchange with worser men"
300,13,339,"That fight with better.” This propos’d, all heard it, and obey’d."
300,13,340,"The kings, ev’n those that suffer’d wounds, Ulysses, Diomed,"
300,13,341,"And Agamemnon, helpt t’ instruct the cómplete army thus:"
300,13,342,"To good gave good arms, worse to worse, yet none were mutinous."
300,13,343,"Thus, arm’d with order, forth they flew; the great Earth - shaker led,"
300,13,344,"A long sword in his sinewy hand, which when he brandishéd"
300,13,345,"It lighten’d still, there was no law for him and it, poor men"
300,13,346,"Must quake before them. These thus mann’d, illustrious Hector then"
300,13,347,His host brought up. The blue - hair’d God and he stretch’d through the
300,13,348,prease
300,13,349,A grievous fight; when to the ships and tents of Greece the seas
300,13,350,"Brake loose, and rag’d. But when they join’d, the dreadful clamour rose"
300,13,351,"To such a height, as not the sea, when up the North - spirit blows"
300,13,352,"Her raging billows, bellows so against the beaten shore;"
300,13,353,"Nor such a rustling keeps a fire, driven with violent blore"
300,13,354,Through woods that grow against a hill; nor so the fervent strokes
300,13,355,Of almost - bursting winds resound against a grove of oaks;
300,13,356,"As did the clamour of these hosts, when both the battles clos’d."
300,13,357,Of all which noble Hector first at Ajax’ breast dispos’d
300,13,358,"His jav’lin, since so right on him the great - soul’d soldier bore;"
300,13,359,"Nor miss’d it, but the bawdricks both that his broad bosom wore,"
300,13,360,"To hang his shield and sword, it strook; both which his flesh"
300,13,361,preserv’d.
300,13,362,"Hector, disdaining that his lance had thus as good as swerv’d,"
300,13,363,"Trode to his strength; but, going off, great Ajax with a stone,"
300,13,364,"One of the many props for ships, that there lay trampled on,"
300,13,365,"Strook his broad breast above his shield, just underneath his throat,"
300,13,366,"And shook him piecemeal; when the stone sprung back again, and smote"
300,13,367,"Earth, like a whirlwind, gath’ring dust with whirring fiercely round,"
300,13,368,"For fervour of his unspent strength, in settling on the ground."
300,13,369,"And as when Jove’s bolt by the roots rends from the earth an oak,"
300,13,370,"His sulphur casting with the blow a strong unsavoury smoke,"
300,13,371,"And on the fall’n plant none dare look but with amazéd eyes,"
300,13,372,(Jove’s thunder being no laughing game) so bow’d strong Hector’s
300,13,373,"thighs,"
300,13,374,"And so with tost - up heels he fell, away his lance he flung,"
300,13,375,"His round shield follow’d, then his helm, and out his armour rung."
300,13,376,"The Greeks then shouted, and ran in, and hop’d to hale him off,"
300,13,377,"And therefore pour’d on darts in storms, to keep his aid aloof;"
300,13,378,"But none could hurt the people’s Guide, nor stir him from his ground;"
300,13,379,"Sarpedon, prince of Lycia, and Glaucus so renown’d,"
300,13,380,"Divine Agenor, Venus’ son, and wise Polydamas,"
300,13,381,"Rush’d to his rescue, and the rest. No one neglective was"
300,13,382,"Of Hector’s safety. All their shields, they couch’d about him close,"
300,13,383,"Rais’d him from earth, and (giving him, in their kind arms, repose)"
300,13,384,"From off the labour carried him, to his rich chariot,"
300,13,385,And bore him mourning towards Troy. But when the flood they got
300,13,386,"Of gulfy Xanthus, that was got by deathless Jupiter,"
300,13,387,"There took they him from chariot, and all besprinkled there"
300,13,388,"His temples with the stream. He breath’d, look’d up, assay’d to rise,"
300,13,389,"And on his knees stay’d spitting blood. Again then clos’d his eyes,"
300,13,390,And back again his body fell. The main blow had not done
300,13,391,"Yet with his spirit. When the Greeks saw worthy Hector gone,"
300,13,392,"Then thought they of their work, then charg’d with much more cheer the"
300,13,393,"foe,"
300,13,394,"And then, far first, Oïliades began the overthrow."
300,13,395,"He darted Satnius Enops’ son, whom famous Nais bore"
300,13,396,"As she was keeping Enops’ flocks on Satnius’ river’s shore,"
300,13,397,"And strook him in his belly’s rim, who upwards fell, and rais’d"
300,13,398,A mighty skirmish with his fall. And then Panthœdés seiz’d
300,13,399,"Prothenor Areilycides, with his revengeful spear,"
300,13,400,"On his right shoulder, strook it through, and laid him breathless there;"
300,13,401,"For which he insolently bragg’d, and cried out: “Not a dart"
300,13,402,"From great - soul’d Panthus’ son, I think, shall ever vainlier part,"
300,13,403,"But some Greek’s bosom it shall take, and make him give his ghost.”"
300,13,404,"This brag the Grecians stomach’d much; but Telamonius most,"
300,13,405,"Who stood most near Prothenor’s fall, and out he sent a lance,"
300,13,406,"Which Panthus’ son, declining, ’scap’d, yet took it to sad chance"
300,13,407,"Archilochus, Antenor’s son, whom heav’n did destinate"
300,13,408,"To that stern end; ’twixt neck and head the jav’lin wrought his fate,"
300,13,409,"And ran in at the upper joint of all the back long bone,"
300,13,410,"Cut both the nerves; and such a load of strength laid Ajax on,"
300,13,411,"As that small part he seiz’d outweigh’d all th’ under limbs, and strook"
300,13,412,"His heels up, so that head and face the earth’s possessions took,"
300,13,413,When all the low parts sprung in air; and thus did Ajax quit
300,13,414,"Panthœdes’ brave: “Now, Panthus’ son, let thy prophetic wit"
300,13,415,"Consider, and disclose a truth, if this man do not weigh"
300,13,416,"Ev’n with Prothenor. I conceive, no one of you will say"
300,13,417,"That either he was base himself, or sprung of any base;"
300,13,418,"Antenor’s brother, or his son, he should be by his face;"
300,13,419,"One of his race, past question, his likeness shows he is,”"
300,13,420,"This spake he, knowing it well enough. The Trojans storm’d at this,"
300,13,421,"And then slew Acamas, to save his brother yet engag’d,"
300,13,422,"Bœotius, dragging him to spoil; and thus the Greeks enrag’d:"
300,13,423,"“O Greeks, ev’n born to bear our darts, yet ever breathing threats,"
300,13,424,"Not always under tears and toils ye see our fortune sweats,"
300,13,425,But sometimes you drop under death. See now your quick among
300,13,426,"Our dead, intranc’d with my weak lance, to prove I have ere long"
300,13,427,Reveng’d my brother. ’Tis the wish of ev’ry honest man
300,13,428,"His brother, slain in Mars’s field, may rest wreak’d in his fane.”"
300,13,429,"This stirr’d fresh envy in the Greeks, but urg’d Peneleus most,"
300,13,430,Who hurl’d his lance at Acamas; he ’scap’d; nor yet it lost
300,13,431,"The force he gave it, for it found the flock - rich Phorbas’ son,"
300,13,432,"Ilionëus, whose dear sire, past all in Ilion,"
300,13,433,"Was lov’d of Hermes, and enrich’d, and to him only bore"
300,13,434,His mother this now slaughter’d man. The dart did undergore
300,13,435,"His eye - lid, by his eye’s dear roots, and out the apple fell,"
300,13,436,The eye pierc’d through. Nor could the nerve that stays the neck repell
300,13,437,"His strong - wing’d lance, but neck and all gave way, and down he"
300,13,438,dropp’d.
300,13,439,"Peneleus then unsheath’d his sword, and from the shoulders chopp’d"
300,13,440,"His luckless head; which down he threw, the helm still sticking on,"
300,13,441,And still the lance fix’d in his eye; which not to see alone
300,13,442,"Contented him, but up again he snatch’d, and show’d it all,"
300,13,443,"With this stern brave: “Ilians, relate brave Ilionëus’ fall"
300,13,444,"To his kind parents, that their roofs their tears may overrun;"
300,13,445,"For so the house of Promachus, and Alegenor’s son,"
300,13,446,"Must with his wife’s eyes overflow, she never seeing more"
300,13,447,"Her dear lord, though we tell his death, when to our native shore"
300,13,448,"We bring from ruin’d Troy our fleet, and men so long forgone.”"
300,13,449,"This said, and seen, pale fear possess’d all those of Ilion,"
300,13,450,"And ev’ry man cast round his eye to see where death was not,"
300,13,451,"That he might fly him. Let not then his grac’d hand be forgot,"
300,13,452,"O Muses, you that dwell in heav’n, that first imbru’d the field"
300,13,453,"With Trojan spoil, when Neptune thus had made their irons yield."
300,13,454,"First Ajax Telamonius the Mysian captain slew,"
300,13,455,Great Hyrtius Gyrtiades. Antilochus o’erthrew
300,13,456,"Phalces and Mermer, to their spoil. Meriones gave end"
300,13,457,To Morys and Hyppotion. Teucer to fate did send
300,13,458,Prothoon and Periphetes. Atrides’ jav’lin chac’d
300,13,459,"Duke Hyperenor, wounding him in that part that is plac’d"
300,13,460,"Betwixt the short ribs and the bones, that to the triple gut"
300,13,461,"Have pertinence; the jav’lin’s head did out his entrails cut,"
300,13,462,His forc’d soul breaking through the wound; night’s black hand clos’d
300,13,463,his eyes.
300,13,464,"Then Ajax, great Oïleus’ son, had divers victories,"
300,13,465,"For when Saturnius suffer’d flight, of all the Grecian race"
300,13,466,Not one with swiftness of his feet could so enrich a chace.
300,13,467,THE END OF THE FOURTEENTH BOOK.
300,13,468,[1] This first verse (after the first four syllables) is to be read as
300,13,469,one of our tens.
300,14,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,14,2,"Jove waking, and beholding Troy in flight,"
300,14,3,"Chides Juno, and sends Iris to the fight"
300,14,4,"To charge the Sea - god to forsake the field,"
300,14,5,"And Phœbus to invade it, with his shield"
300,14,6,"Recov’ring Hector’s bruis’d and eraséd pow’rs,"
300,14,7,"To field he goes, and makes new conquerors,"
300,14,8,The Trojans giving now the Grecians chace
300,14,9,"Ev’n to their fleet. Then Ajax turns his face,"
300,14,10,"And feeds, with many Trojan lives, his ire;"
300,14,11,Who then brought brands to set the fleet on fire.
300,14,12,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,14,13,"Jove sees in O his oversight,"
300,14,14,"Chides Juno, Neptune calls from fight."
300,14,15,"The Trojans, beat past pale and dike, and numbers prostrate laid,"
300,14,16,"All got to chariot, fear - driv’n all, and fear’d as men dismay’d."
300,14,17,"Then Jove on Ida’s top awak’d, rose from Saturnia’s side,"
300,14,18,"Stood up, and look’d upon the war; and all inverted spied"
300,14,19,"Since he had seen it; th’ Ilians now in rout, the Greeks in fight;"
300,14,20,"King Neptune, with his long sword, chief; great Hector put down quite,"
300,14,21,"Laid flat in field, and with a crown of princes compasséd"
300,14,22,"So stopp’d up that he scarce could breathe, his mind’s sound habit"
300,14,23,"fled,"
300,14,24,"And he still spitting blood. Indeed, his hurt was not set on"
300,14,25,By one that was the weakest Greek. But him Jove look’d upon
300,14,26,"With eyes of pity; on his wife with horrible aspéct,"
300,14,27,"To whom he said: “O thou in ill most cunning architect,"
300,14,28,All arts and comments that exceed’st! not only to enforce
300,14,29,"Hector from fight, but, with his men, to show the Greeks a course."
300,14,30,"I fear, as formerly, so now, these ills have with thy hands"
300,14,31,"Their first fruits sown, and therefore could load all thy limbs with"
300,14,32,"bands,"
300,14,33,"Forgett’st thou, when I hang’d thee up, how to thy feet I tied"
300,14,34,"Two anvils, golden manacles on thy false wrists implied,"
300,14,35,And let thee mercilessly hang from our refinéd heav’n
300,14,36,Ev’n to earth’s vapours; all the Gods in great Olympus giv’n
300,14,37,"To mutinies about thee, yet, though all stood staring on,"
300,14,38,"None durst dissolve thee, for these hands, had they but seiz’d upon"
300,14,39,"Thy friend, had headlong thrown him off from our star - bearing round,"
300,14,40,"Till he had tumbled out his breath, and piece - meal dash’d the ground?"
300,14,41,"Nor was my angry spirit calm’d so soon, for those foul seas,"
300,14,42,"On which, inducing northern flaws, thou shipwrack’dst Hercules,"
300,14,43,"And toss’d him to the Coan shore, that thou shouldst tempt again"
300,14,44,"My wrath’s importance, when thou seest, besides, how grossly vain"
300,14,45,My pow’rs can make thy policies; for from their utmost force
300,14,46,"I freed my son, and set him safe in Argos, nurse of horse."
300,14,47,"These I remember to thy thoughts, that thou may’st shun these sleights,"
300,14,48,"And know how badly bed - sports thrive, procur’d by base deceits.”"
300,14,49,"This frighted the offending queen, who with this state excus’d"
300,14,50,"Her kind unkindness: “Witness Earth, and Heav’n so far diffus’d,"
300,14,51,"Thou Flood whose silent gliding waves the under ground doth bear,"
300,14,52,"(Which is the great’st and gravest oath, that any God can swear)"
300,14,53,"Thy sacred head, those secret joys that our young bed gave forth,"
300,14,54,By which I never rashly swore! that He who shakes the earth
300,14,55,"Not by my counsel did this wrong to Hector and his host,"
300,14,56,"But, pitying th’ oppresséd Greeks, their fleet being nearly lost,"
300,14,57,"Reliev’d their hard conditión, yet utterly impell’d"
300,14,58,By his free mind. Which since I see is so offensive held
300,14,59,"To thy high pleasure, I will now advise him not to tread"
300,14,60,"But where thy tempest - raising feet, O Jupiter, shall lead.”"
300,14,61,"Jove laugh’d to hear her so submiss, and said: “My fair - ey’d love,"
300,14,62,"If still thus thou and I were one, in counsels held above,"
300,14,63,"Neptune would still in word and fact be ours, if not in heart."
300,14,64,"If then thy tongue and heart agree, from hence to heav’n depart,"
300,14,65,"To call the excellent - in - bows, the Rain - bow, and the Sun,"
300,14,66,"That both may visit both the hosts; the Grecian army one,"
300,14,67,"And that is Iris, let her haste, and make the Sea - god cease"
300,14,68,"T’ assist the Greeks, and to his court retire from war in peace;"
300,14,69,"Let Phœbus, on the Trojan part, inspire with wonted pow’r"
300,14,70,"Great Hector’s spirits, make his thoughts forget the late stern hour,"
300,14,71,"And all his anguish, setting on his whole recover’d man"
300,14,72,"To make good his late grace in fight, and hold in constant wane"
300,14,73,"The Grecian glories, till they fall, in flight before the fleet"
300,14,74,Of vex’d Achilles. Which extreme will prove the mean to greet
300,14,75,"Thee with thy wish, for then the eyes of great Æacides"
300,14,76,"(Made witness of the gen’ral ill, that doth so near him prease)"
300,14,77,"Will make his own particular look out, and by degrees"
300,14,78,"Abate his wrath, that, though himself for no extremities"
300,14,79,"Will seem reflected, yet his friend may get of him the grace"
300,14,80,To help his country in his arms; and he shall make fit place
300,14,81,"For his full presence with his death, which shall be well fore - run;"
300,14,82,"For I will first renown his life with slaughter of my son,"
300,14,83,"Divine Sarpedon, and his death great Hector’s pow’r shall wreak,"
300,14,84,"Ending his ends. Then, at once, out shall the fury break"
300,14,85,"Of fierce Achilles, and, with that, the flight now felt shall turn,"
300,14,86,"And then last, till in wrathful flames the long - sieg’d Ilion burn."
300,14,87,"Minerva’s counsel shall become grave mean to this my will,"
300,14,88,Which no God shall neglect before Achilles take his fill
300,14,89,Of slaughter for his slaughter’d friend; ev’n Hector’s slaughter thrown
300,14,90,Under his anger; that these facts may then make fully known
300,14,91,"My vow’s performance, made of late, and, with my bowéd head,"
300,14,92,"Confirm’d to Thetis, when her arms embrac’d my knees, and pray’d"
300,14,93,That to her city - razing son I would all honour show.”
300,14,94,"This heard, his charge she seem’d t’ intend, and to Olympus flew."
300,14,95,"But, as the mind of such a man that hath a great way gone,"
300,14,96,"And either knowing not his way, or then would let alone"
300,14,97,"His purpos’d journey, is distract, and in his vexéd mind"
300,14,98,"Resolves now not to go, now goes, still many ways inclin’d;"
300,14,99,"So rev’rend Juno headlong flew, and ’gainst her stomach striv’d,"
300,14,100,"For, being amongst th’ immortal Gods in high heav’n soon arriv’d,"
300,14,101,"All rising, welcoming with cups her little absence thence,"
300,14,102,"She all their courtships overpass’d with solemn negligence,"
300,14,103,"Save that which fair - cheek’d Themis show’d, and her kind cup she took,"
300,14,104,"For first she ran and met with her, and ask’d: “What troubled look"
300,14,105,"She brought to heav’n? She thought, for truth, that Jove had terrified"
300,14,106,Her spirits strangely since she went.” The fair - arm’d Queen replied:
300,14,107,"“That truth may eas’ly be suppos’d; you, Goddess Themis, know"
300,14,108,"His old severity and pride, but you bear’t out with show,"
300,14,109,"And like the banquet’s arbiter amongst th’ Immortals’ fare,"
300,14,110,"Though well you hear amongst them all, how bad his actions are;"
300,14,111,"Nor are all here, or anywhere, mortals, nor Gods, I fear,"
300,14,112,"Entirely pleas’d with what he does, though thus ye banquet here.”"
300,14,113,"Thus took she place, displeasedly; the feast in general"
300,14,114,"Bewraying privy spleens at Jove; and then, to colour all,"
300,14,115,"She laugh’d, but merely from her lips, for over her black brows"
300,14,116,Her still - bent forehead was not clear’d; yet this her passion’s throes
300,14,117,"Brought forth in spite, being lately school’d: “Alas, what fools are we"
300,14,118,"That envy Jove! Or that by act, word, thought, can fantasy"
300,14,119,"Any resistance to his will! He sits far off, nor cares,"
300,14,120,"Nor moves, but says he knows his strength, to all degrees compares"
300,14,121,"His greatness past all other Gods, and that in fortitude,"
300,14,122,"And ev’ry other godlike pow’r, he reigns past all indu’d."
300,14,123,"For which great eminence all you Gods, whatever ill he does,"
300,14,124,"Sustain with patience. Here is Mars, I think, not free from woes,"
300,14,125,"And yet he bears them like himself. The great God had a son,"
300,14,126,"Whom he himself yet justifies, one that from all men won"
300,14,127,"Just surname of their best belov’d, Ascalaphus; yet he,"
300,14,128,"By Jove’s high grace to Troy, is slain.” Mars started horribly,"
300,14,129,"As Juno knew he would, at this, beat with his hurl’d - out hands"
300,14,130,"His brawny thighs, cried out, and said: “O you that have commands"
300,14,131,"In these high temples, bear with me, if I revenge the death"
300,14,132,"Of such a son. I’ll to the fleet, and though I sink beneath"
300,14,133,"The fate of being shot to hell, by Jove’s fell thunder - stone,"
300,14,134,"And lie all grim’d amongst the dead with dust and blood, my son"
300,14,135,Revenge shall honour.” Then he charg’d Fear and Dismay to join
300,14,136,"His horse and chariot. He got arms, that over heav’n did shine"
300,14,137,And then a wrath more great and grave in Jove had been prepar’d
300,14,138,"Against the Gods than Juno caus’d, if Pallas had not car’d"
300,14,139,"More for the peace of heav’n than Mars; who leap’d out of her throne,"
300,14,140,"Rapt up her helmet, lance, and shield, and made her fane’s porch groan"
300,14,141,"With her egression to his stay, and thus his rage defers:"
300,14,142,"“Furious and foolish, th’ art undone! Hast thou for nought thine ears?"
300,14,143,Heard’st thou not Juno being arriv’d from heav’n’s great  King but now?
300,14,144,"Or wouldst thou he himself should rise, forc’d with thy rage, to show"
300,14,145,"The dreadful pow’r she urg’d in him, so justly being stirr’d?"
300,14,146,"Know, thou most impudent and mad, thy wrath had not inferr’d"
300,14,147,"Mischief to thee, but to us all. His spirit had instantly"
300,14,148,"Left both the hosts, and turn’d his hands to uproars in the sky,"
300,14,149,Guilty and guiltless both to wrack in his high rage had gone.
300,14,150,"And therefore, as thou lov’st thyself, cease fury for thy son;"
300,14,151,"Another, far exceeding him in heart and strength of hand,"
300,14,152,"Or is, or will be shortly, slain. It were a work would stand"
300,14,153,"Jove in much trouble, to free all from death that would not die.”"
300,14,154,This threat ev’n nail’d him to his throne; when heav’n’s chief Majesty
300,14,155,"Call’d bright Apollo from his fane, and Iris that had place"
300,14,156,"Of internunciess from the Gods, to whom she did the grace"
300,14,157,"Of Jupiter, to this effect: “It is Saturnius’ will,"
300,14,158,"That both, with utmost speed, should stoop to the Idalian hill,"
300,14,159,"To know his further pleasure there. And this let me advise,"
300,14,160,"When you arrive, and are in reach of his refulgent eyes,"
300,14,161,"His pleasure heard, perform it all, of whatsoever kind.”"
300,14,162,"Thus mov’d she back, and us’d her throne. Those two outstripp’d the"
300,14,163,"wind,"
300,14,164,"And Ida all - enchas’d with springs they soon attain’d, and found"
300,14,165,"Where far - discerning Jupiter, in his repose, had crown’d"
300,14,166,"The brows of Gargarus, and wrapt an odorif’rous cloud"
300,14,167,"About his bosom. Coming near, they stood. Nor now he show’d"
300,14,168,"His angry count’nance, since so soon he saw they made th’ access"
300,14,169,That his lov’d wife enjoin’d; but first the fair ambassadress
300,14,170,"He thus commanded: “Iris, go to Neptune, and relate"
300,14,171,"Our pleasure truly, and at large. Command him from the fate"
300,14,172,"Of human war, and either greet the Gods’ society,"
300,14,173,"Or the divine sea make his seat. If proudly he deny,"
300,14,174,"Let better counsels be his guides, than such as bid me war,"
300,14,175,"And tempt my charge, though he be strong, for I am stronger far,"
300,14,176,"And elder born. Nor let him dare, to boast even state with me"
300,14,177,"Whom all Gods else prefer in fear.” This said, down hasted she"
300,14,178,"From Ida’s top to Ilion; and like a mighty snow,"
300,14,179,"Or gelid hail, that from the clouds the northern spirit doth blow;"
300,14,180,"So fell the windy - footed dame, and found with quick repair"
300,14,181,"The wat’ry God, to whom she said: “God with the sable hair,"
300,14,182,"I came from Ægis - bearing Jove, to bid thee cease from fight,"
300,14,183,"And visit heav’n, or th’ ample seas. Which if, in his despite,"
300,14,184,"Or disobedience, thou deniest, he threatens thee to come,"
300,14,185,"In opposite fight, to field himself; and therefore warns thee home,"
300,14,186,"His hands eschewing, since his pow’r is far - superior,"
300,14,187,"His birth before thee; and affirms, thy lov’d heart should abhor"
300,14,188,"To vaunt equality with him, whom ev’ry Deity fears.”"
300,14,189,"He answer’d: “O unworthy thing! Though he be great, he bears"
300,14,190,"His tongue too proudly, that ourself, born to an equal share"
300,14,191,"Of state and freedom, he would force. Three brothers born we are"
300,14,192,"To Saturn, Rhea brought us forth, this Jupiter, and I."
300,14,193,"And Pluto, God of under - grounds. The world indiff’rently"
300,14,194,"Dispos’d betwixt us; ev’ry one his kingdom; I the seas,"
300,14,195,"Pluto the black lot, Jupiter the principalities"
300,14,196,"Of broad heav’n, all the sky and clouds, was sorted out. The earth"
300,14,197,"And high Olympus common are, and due to either’s birth."
300,14,198,Why then should I be aw’d by him? Content he his great heart
300,14,199,"With his third portion, and not think, to amplify his part,"
300,14,200,"With terrors of his stronger hands, on me, as if I were"
300,14,201,The most ignoble of us all. Let him contain in fear
300,14,202,"His daughters and his sons, begot by his own person, This"
300,14,203,Holds more convenience. They must hear these violent threats of his.”
300,14,204,"“Shall I,” said Iris, “bear from thee, an answer so austere?"
300,14,205,"Or wilt thou change it? Changing minds, all noble natures bear."
300,14,206,"And well thou know’st, these greatest born, the Furies follow still.”"
300,14,207,"He answer’d: “Iris, thy reply keeps time, and shows thy skill."
300,14,208,"O ’tis a most praiseworthy thing, when messengers can tell,"
300,14,209,"Besides their messages, such things, as fit th’ occasion well."
300,14,210,"But this much grieves my heart and soul, that being in pow’r and state"
300,14,211,"All - ways his equal, and so fix’d by one decree in fate,"
300,14,212,"He should to me, as under him, ill language give, and chide."
300,14,213,"Yet now, though still incens’d, I yield, affirming this beside,"
300,14,214,And I enforce it with a threat: That if without consent
300,14,215,"Of me, Minerva, Mercury, the Queen of regiment,"
300,14,216,"And Vulcan, he will either spare high Ilion, or not race"
300,14,217,"Her turrets to the lowest stone, and, with both these, not grace"
300,14,218,"The Greeks as victors absolute, inform him this from me —"
300,14,219,His pride and my contempt shall live at endless enmity.”
300,14,220,"This said, he left the Greeks, and rush’d into his wat’ry throne,"
300,14,221,"Much miss’d of all th’ heroic host. When Jove discern’d him gone,"
300,14,222,"Apollo’s service he employ’d, and said: “Lov’d Phœbus, go"
300,14,223,"To Hector; now th’ earth - shaking God hath taken sea, and so"
300,14,224,"Shrunk from the horrors I denounc’d; which standing, he, and all"
300,14,225,"The under - seated Deities, that circle Saturn’s fall,"
300,14,226,Had heard of me in such a fight as had gone hard for them.
300,14,227,"But both for them and me ’tis best, that thus they fly th’ extreme,"
300,14,228,"That had not pass’d us without sweat. Now then, in thy hands take"
300,14,229,"My adder - fring’d affrighting shield, which with such terror shake,"
300,14,230,"That fear may shake the Greeks to flight. Besides this, add thy care,"
300,14,231,"O Phœbus, far - off shooting God, that this so sickly fare"
300,14,232,"Of famous Hector be recur’d, and quickly so excite"
300,14,233,"His amplest pow’rs, that all the Greeks may grace him with their"
300,14,234,"flight,"
300,14,235,"Ev’n to their ships, and Hellespont; and then will I devise"
300,14,236,"All words and facts again for Greece, that largely may suffice"
300,14,237,"To breathe them from their instant toils.” Thus from th’ Idæan height,"
300,14,238,"Like air’s swift pigeon - killer, stoop’d the far - shot God of light,"
300,14,239,"And found great Hector sitting up, not stretch’d upon his bed,"
300,14,240,"Not wheezing with a stopp’d - up spirit, not in cold sweats, but fed"
300,14,241,"With fresh and comfortable veins, but his mind all his own,"
300,14,242,"But round about him all his friends, as well as ever known."
300,14,243,"And this was with the mind of Jove, that flew to him before"
300,14,244,"Apollo came; who, as he saw no sign of any sore,"
300,14,245,"Ask’d, like a cheerful visitant: “Why in this sickly kind,"
300,14,246,"Great Hector, sitt’st thou so apart? Can any grief of mind"
300,14,247,"Invade thy fortitude?” He spake, but with a feeble voice:"
300,14,248,"“O thou, the best of Deities! Why, since I thus rejoice"
300,14,249,"By thy so serious benefit, demand’st thou, as in mirth,"
300,14,250,"And to my face, if I were ill? For, more than what thy worth"
300,14,251,"Must needs take note of, doth not Fame from all mouths fill thine ears,"
300,14,252,"That, as my hand at th’ Achive fleet was making massacres"
300,14,253,"Of men whom valiant Ajax led, his strength strook with a stone"
300,14,254,"All pow’r of more hurt from my breast? My very soul was gone,"
300,14,255,And once to - day I thought to see the house of Dis and Death.”
300,14,256,"“Be strong,” said he, “for such a spirit now sends the God of breath"
300,14,257,"From airy Ida, as shall run through all Greek spirits in thee."
300,14,258,"Apollo with the golden sword, the clear Far - seer, see,"
300,14,259,"Him, who betwixt death and thy life, ’twixt ruin and those tow’rs,"
300,14,260,"Ere this day oft hath held his shield. Come then, be all thy pow’rs"
300,14,261,"In wonted vigour, let thy knights with all their horse assay"
300,14,262,"The Grecian fleet, myself will lead, and scour so clear the way,"
300,14,263,That flight shall leave no Greek a rub.” Thus instantly inspir’d
300,14,264,Were all his nerves with matchless strength; and then his friends he
300,14,265,fir’d
300,14,266,"Against their foes, when to his eyes his ears confirm’d the God."
300,14,267,"Then, as a goodly - headed hart, or goat, bred in the wood,"
300,14,268,"A rout of country huntsmen chase, with all their hounds in cry,"
300,14,269,"The beast yet or the shady woods, or rocks excessive high,"
300,14,270,"Keep safe, or our unwieldy fates (that ev’n in hunters sway)"
300,14,271,Bar them the poor beast’s pulling down; when straight the clam’rous
300,14,272,fray
300,14,273,"Calls out a lion, hugely - man’d, and his abhorréd view"
300,14,274,Turns headlong in unturning flight (though vent’rous) all the crew;
300,14,275,So hitherto the chasing Greeks their slaughter dealt by troops;
300,14,276,"But, after Hector was beheld range here and there, then stoops"
300,14,277,"The boldest courage, then their heels took in their drooping hearts,"
300,14,278,"And then spake Andræmonides, a man of far - best parts"
300,14,279,"Of all the Ætolians, skill’d in darts, strenuous in fights of stand,"
300,14,280,And one of whom few of the Greeks could get the better hand
300,14,281,"For rhetoric, when they fought with words; with all which being wise,"
300,14,282,Thus spake he to his Grecian friends: “O mischief! Now mine eyes
300,14,283,"Discern no little miracle; Hector escap’d from death,"
300,14,284,"And all - recover’d, when all thought his soul had sunk beneath"
300,14,285,The hands of Ajax. But some God hath sav’d and freed again
300,14,286,"Him that but now dissolv’d the knees of many a Grecian,"
300,14,287,"And now I fear will weaken more; for, not without the hand"
300,14,288,"Of Him that thunders, can his pow’rs thus still the forefights stand,"
300,14,289,Thus still triumphant. Hear me then: Our troops in quick retreat
300,14,290,"Let’s draw up to our fleet, and we, that boast ourselves the great,"
300,14,291,"Stand firm, and try if these that raise so high their charging darts"
300,14,292,"May be resisted. I believe, ev’n this great heart of hearts"
300,14,293,"Will fear himself to be too bold, in charging thorow us.”"
300,14,294,"They eas’ly heard him, and obey’d; when all the generous"
300,14,295,"They call’d t’ encounter Hector’s charge, and turn’d the common men"
300,14,296,"Back to the fleet. And these were they, that bravely furnish’d then"
300,14,297,"The fierce forefight: Th’ Ajaces both, the worthy Cretan king,"
300,14,298,"The Mars - like Meges, Merion, and Teucer. Up then bring"
300,14,299,"The Trojan chiefs their men in heaps; before whom, amply - pac’d,"
300,14,300,"March’d Hector, and in front of him Apollo, who had cast"
300,14,301,"About his bright aspect a cloud, and did before him bear"
300,14,302,"Jove’s huge and each - where - shaggy shield, which, to contain in fear"
300,14,303,"Offending men, the God - smith gave to Jove; with this he led"
300,14,304,The Trojan forces. The Greeks stood. A fervent clamour spread
300,14,305,"The air on both sides as they join’d. Out flew the shafts and darts,"
300,14,306,"Some falling short, but other some found butts in breasts and hearts."
300,14,307,"As long as Phœbus held but out his horrid shield, so long"
300,14,308,"The darts flew raging either way, and death grew both ways strong;"
300,14,309,"But when the Greeks had seen his face, and, who it was that shook"
300,14,310,"The bristled targe, knew by his voice, then all their strengths forsook"
300,14,311,"Their nerves and minds. And then look how a goodly herd of neat,"
300,14,312,"Or wealthy flock of sheep, being close, and dreadless at their meet,"
300,14,313,"In some black midnight, suddenly, and not a keeper near,"
300,14,314,"A brace of horrid bears rush in, and then fly here and there"
300,14,315,The poor affrighted flocks or herds; so ev’ry way dispers’d
300,14,316,"The heartless Grecians, so the Sun their headstrong chace revers’d"
300,14,317,"To headlong flight, and that day rais’d, with all grace, Hector’s head."
300,14,318,"Arcesilaus then he slew, and Stichius; Stichius led"
300,14,319,Bœotia’s brazen - coated men; the other was the friend
300,14,320,Of mighty - soul’d Menestheüs. Æneas brought to end
300,14,321,"Medon and Jasus; Medon was the brother, though but base,"
300,14,322,"Of swift Oïliades, and dwelt, far from his breeding place,"
300,14,323,"In Phylace; the other led th’ Athenian bands, his sire"
300,14,324,"Was Spelus, Bucolus’s son. Mecistheus did expire"
300,14,325,"Beneath Polydamas’s hand. Polites, Echius slew,"
300,14,326,Just at the joining of the hosts. Agenor overthrew
300,14,327,Clonius. Bold Deïochus felt Alexander’s lance;
300,14,328,"It strook his shoulder’s upper part, and did his head advance"
300,14,329,"Quite through his breast, as from the fight he turn’d him for retreat."
300,14,330,"While these stood spoiling of the slain, the Greeks found time to get"
300,14,331,"Beyond the dike and th’ undik’d pales; all scapes they gladly gain’d,"
300,14,332,Till all had pass’d the utmost wall; Necessity so reign’d.
300,14,333,"Then Hector cried out: “Take no spoil, but rush on to the fleet;"
300,14,334,"From whose assault, for spoil or flight, if any man I meet,"
300,14,335,He meets his death; nor in the fire of holy funeral
300,14,336,His brother’s or his sister’s hands shall cast within our wall
300,14,337,"His loathéd body; but, without, the throats of dogs shall grave"
300,14,338,"His manless limbs.” This said, the scourge his forward horses drave"
300,14,339,"Through ev’ry order; and, with him, all whipp’d their chariots on,"
300,14,340,"All threat’ningly, out - thund’ring shouts as earth were overthrown."
300,14,341,"Before them march’d Apollo still, and, as he march’d, digg’d down,"
300,14,342,"Without all labour, with his feet the dike, till, with his own,"
300,14,343,"He fill’d it to the top, and made way both for man and horse"
300,14,344,"As broad and long as with a lance, cast out to try one’s force,"
300,14,345,A man could measure. Into this they pour’d whole troops as fast
300,14,346,"As num’rous; Phœbus still, before, for all their haste,"
300,14,347,"Still shaking Jove’s unvalu’d shield, and held it up to all."
300,14,348,"And then, as he had chok’d their dike, he tumbled down their wall."
300,14,349,"And look how eas’ly any boy, upon the sea - ebb’d shore,"
300,14,350,"Makes with a little sand a toy, and cares for it no more,"
300,14,351,"But as he rais’d it childishly, so in his wanton vein,"
300,14,352,"Both with his hands and feet he pulls, and spurns it down again;"
300,14,353,"So slight, O Phœbus, thy hands made of that huge Grecian toil,"
300,14,354,"And their late stand, so well - resolv’d, as eas’ly mad’st recoil."
300,14,355,Thus stood they driv’n up at their fleet; where each heard other’s
300,14,356,"thought,"
300,14,357,"Exhorted, passing humbly pray’d, all all the Gods besought,"
300,14,358,"With hands held up to heav’n, for help. ’Mongst all the good old man,"
300,14,359,"Grave Nestor, for his counsels call’d the Argives’ guardian,"
300,14,360,"Fell on his aged knees, and pray’d, and to the starry host"
300,14,361,"Stretch’d out his hands for aid to theirs, of all thus moving most:"
300,14,362,"“O father Jove, if ever man, of all our host, did burn"
300,14,363,"Fat thighs of oxen or of sheep, for grace of safe return,"
300,14,364,"In fruitful Argos, and obtain’d the bowing of thy head"
300,14,365,"For promise of his humble pray’rs, O now remember him,"
300,14,366,"Thou merely heav’nly, and clear up the foul brows of this dim"
300,14,367,And cruel day; do not destroy our zeal for Trojan pride.”
300,14,368,"He pray’d, and heav’n’s great Counsellor with store of thunder tried"
300,14,369,"His former grace good, and so heard the old man’s hearty pray’rs."
300,14,370,"The Trojans took Jove’s sign for them, and pour’d out their affairs"
300,14,371,"In much more violence on the Greeks, and thought on nought but fight."
300,14,372,"And as a huge wave of a sea, swoln to his rudest height,"
300,14,373,"Breaks over both sides of a ship, being all - urg’d by the wind,"
300,14,374,For that’s it makes the wave so proud; in such a borne - up kind
300,14,375,"The Trojans overgat the wall, and, getting in their horse,"
300,14,376,"Fought close at fleet, which now the Greeks ascended for their force."
300,14,377,"Then from their chariots they with darts, the Greeks with bead - hooks"
300,14,378,"fought,"
300,14,379,"Kept still aboard for naval fights, their heads with iron wrought"
300,14,380,"In hooks and pikes. Achilles’ friend, still while he saw the wall,"
300,14,381,"That stood without their fleet, afford employment for them all,"
300,14,382,"Was never absent from the tent of that man - loving Greek,"
300,14,383,"Late - hurt Eurypylus, but sate, and ev’ry way did seek,"
300,14,384,"To spend the sharp time of his wound, with all the ease he could"
300,14,385,"In med’cines, and in kind discourse. But when he might behold"
300,14,386,"The Trojans past the wall, the Greeks flight - driv’n, and all in cries,"
300,14,387,"Then cried he out, cast down his hands, and beat with grief his thighs,"
300,14,388,"Then, “O Eurypylus,” he cried, “now all thy need of me"
300,14,389,"Must bear my absence, now a work of more necessity"
300,14,390,"Calls hence, and I must haste to call Achilles to the field."
300,14,391,"Who knows, but, God assisting me, my words may make him yield?"
300,14,392,The motion of a friend is strong.” His feet thus took him thence.
300,14,393,The rest yet stood their enemies firm; but all their violence
300,14,394,(Though Troy fought there with fewer men) lack’d vigour to repell
300,14,395,"Those fewer from their navy’s charge, and so that charge as well"
300,14,396,Lack’d force to spoil their fleet or tents. And as a shipwright’s line
300,14,397,(Dispos’d by such a hand as learn’d from th’ Artizan divine
300,14,398,The perfect practice of his art) directs or guards so well
300,14,399,"The naval timber then in frame, that all the laid - on steel"
300,14,400,"Can hew no further than may serve, to give the timber th’ end"
300,14,401,Fore - purpos’d by the skilful wright; so both hosts did contend
300,14,402,"With such a line or law applied, to what their steel would gain."
300,14,403,At other ships fought other men; but Hector did maintain
300,14,404,His quarrel firm at Ajax’ ship. And so did both employ
300,14,405,About one vessel all their toil; nor could the one destroy
300,14,406,"The ship with fire, nor force the man, nor that man yet get gone"
300,14,407,"The other from so near his ship, for God had brought him on."
300,14,408,"But now did Ajax, with a dart, wound deadly in the breast"
300,14,409,"Caletor, son of Clytius, as he with fire address’d"
300,14,410,"To burn the vessel; as he fell, the brand fell from his hand."
300,14,411,"When Hector saw his sister’s son lie slaughter’d in the sand,"
300,14,412,"He call’d to all his friends, and pray’d they would not in that strait"
300,14,413,"Forsake his nephew, but maintain about his corse the fight,"
300,14,414,And save it from the spoil of Greece. Then sent he out a lance
300,14,415,"At Ajax, in his nephew’s wreak; which miss’d, but made the chance"
300,14,416,"On Lycophron Mastorides, that was the household friend"
300,14,417,"Of Ajax, born in Cythera; whom Ajax did defend,"
300,14,418,"Being fled to his protectión, for killing of a man"
300,14,419,Amongst the god - like Cytherans. The vengeful jav’lin ran
300,14,420,"Quite through his head, above his ear, as he was standing by"
300,14,421,"His fautour then astern his ship, from whence his soul did fly,"
300,14,422,And to the earth his body fell. The hair stood up an end
300,14,423,"On Ajax, who to Teucer call’d (his brother) saying: “Friend"
300,14,424,"Our lovéd consort, whom we brought from Cythera, and grac’d"
300,14,425,"So like our father, Hector’s hand hath made him breathe his last."
300,14,426,"Where then are all thy death - borne shafts, and that unvalu’d bow"
300,14,427,"Apollo gave thee?” Teucer straight his brother’s thoughts did know,"
300,14,428,"Stood near him, and dispatch’d a shaft, amongst the Trojan fight."
300,14,429,"It strook Pisenor’s goodly son, young Clitus, the delight"
300,14,430,"Of the renown’d Polydamas, the bridle in his hand,"
300,14,431,"As he was labouring his horse, to please the high command"
300,14,432,"Of Hector and his Trojan friends, and bring him where the fight"
300,14,433,"Made greatest tumult; but his strife, for honour in their sight,"
300,14,434,"Wrought not what sight or wishes help’d; for, turning back his look,"
300,14,435,"The hollow of his neck the shaft came singing on, and strook,"
300,14,436,"And down he fell; his horses back, and hurried through the field"
300,14,437,"The empty chariot. Panthus’ son made all haste, and withheld"
300,14,438,"Their loose career, disposing them to Protiaon’s son,"
300,14,439,"Astynous, with special charge, to keep them ever on,"
300,14,440,"And in his sight. So he again, amongst the foremost went."
300,14,441,"At Hector then another shaft, incenséd Teucer sent,"
300,14,442,"Which, had it hit him, sure had hurt, and, had it hurt him, slain,"
300,14,443,"And, had it slain him, it had driv’n all those to Troy again."
300,14,444,"But Jove’s mind was not sleeping now, it wak’d to Hector’s fame,"
300,14,445,And Teucer’s infamy; himself (in Teucer’s deadly aim)
300,14,446,"His well - wrought string dissevering, that serv’d his bravest bow;"
300,14,447,"His shaft flew quite another way, his bow the earth did strow."
300,14,448,"At all which Teucer stood amaz’d, and to his brother cried:"
300,14,449,"“O prodigy! Without all doubt, our angel doth deride"
300,14,450,The counsels of our fight; he brake a string my hands put on
300,14,451,"This morning, and was newly made, and well might have set gone"
300,14,452,"A hundred arrows; and, beside, he strook out of my hand"
300,14,453,"The bow Apollo gave.” He said: “Then, good friend, do not stand"
300,14,454,"More on thy archery, since God, preventer of all grace"
300,14,455,"Desir’d by Grecians, slights it so. Take therefore in the place"
300,14,456,"A good large lance, and on thy neck a target cast as bright,"
300,14,457,"With which come fight thyself with some, and other some excite,"
300,14,458,"That without labour at the least, though we prove worser men,"
300,14,459,"Troy may not brag it took our ships. Come, mind our business, then.”"
300,14,460,"This said, he hasted to his tent, left there his shafts and bow,"
300,14,461,And then his double double shield did on his shoulders throw;
300,14,462,"Upon his honour’d head he plac’d his helmet thickly - plum’d,"
300,14,463,"And then his strong and well - pil’d lance in his fair hand assum’d,"
300,14,464,"Return’d; and boldly took his place, by his great brother’s side."
300,14,465,"When Hector saw his arrows broke, out to his friends he cried:"
300,14,466,"“O friends, be yet more comforted; I saw the hands of Jove"
300,14,467,Break the great Grecian archer’s shafts. ’Tis easy to approve
300,14,468,That Jove’s pow’r is direct with men; as well in those set high
300,14,469,"Upon the sudden, as in those depress’d as suddenly,"
300,14,470,And those not put in state at all. As now he takes away
300,14,471,"Strength from the Greeks, and gives it us; then use it, and assay"
300,14,472,With join’d hands this approachéd fleet. If any bravely buy
300,14,473,"His fame or fate with wounds or death, in Jove’s name let him die."
300,14,474,"Who for his country suffers death, sustains no shameful thing,"
300,14,475,"His wife in honour shall survive, his progeny shall spring"
300,14,476,"In endless summers, and their roofs with patrimony swell."
300,14,477,"And all this, though, with all their freight, the Greek ships we"
300,14,478,repell.”
300,14,479,"His friends thus cheer’d; on th’ other part, strong Ajax stirr’d his"
300,14,480,friends:
300,14,481,"“O Greeks,” said he, “what shame is this, that no man more defends"
300,14,482,"His fame and safety, than to live, and thus be forc’d to shrink!"
300,14,483,"Now either save your fleet, or die; unless ye vainly think"
300,14,484,That you can live and they destroy’d. Perceives not ev’ry ear
300,14,485,"How Hector heartens up his men, and hath his fire - brands here"
300,14,486,"Now ready to inflame our fleet? He doth not bid them dance,"
300,14,487,"That you may take your ease and see, but to the fight advance."
300,14,488,"No counsel can serve us but this: To mix both hands and hearts,"
300,14,489,"And bear up close. ’Tis better much, t’ expose our utmost parts"
300,14,490,"To one day’s certain life or death, than languish in a war"
300,14,491,"So base as this, beat to our ships by our inferiors far.”"
300,14,492,Thus rous’d he up their spirits and strengths. To work then both sides
300,14,493,"went,"
300,14,494,"When Hector the Phocensian duke to fields of darkness sent,"
300,14,495,"Fierce Schedius, Perimedes’ son; which Ajax did requite"
300,14,496,"With slaughter of Laodamas, that led the foot to fight,"
300,14,497,And was Antenor’s famous son. Polydamas did end
300,14,498,"Otus, surnam’d Cyllenius, whom Phydas made his friend,"
300,14,499,"Being chief of the Epeians’ bands. Whose fall when Meges view’d,"
300,14,500,"He let fly at his feller’s life; who, shrinking in, eschew’d"
300,14,501,The well - aim’d lance; Apollo’s will denied that Panthus’ son
300,14,502,Should fall amongst the foremost fights; the dart the mid - breast won
300,14,503,"Of Crasmus; Meges won his arms. At Meges, Dolops then"
300,14,504,"Bestow’d his lance; he was the son of Lampus, best of men,"
300,14,505,"And Lampus of Laomedon, well - skill’d in strength of mind,"
300,14,506,"He strook Phylides’ shield quite through, whose curets, better lin’d,"
300,14,507,"And hollow’d fitly, sav’d his life. Phyleus left him them,"
300,14,508,"Who from Epirus brought them home, on that part where the stream"
300,14,509,"Of famous Seléés doth run; Euphetes did bestow,"
300,14,510,"Being guest with him, those well - prov’d arms, to wear against the foe,"
300,14,511,"And now they sav’d his son from death. At Dolops, Meges threw"
300,14,512,"A spear well - pil’d, that strook his casque full in the height; off flew"
300,14,513,"His purple feather, newly made, and in the dust it fell."
300,14,514,"While these thus striv’d for victory, and either’s hope serv’d well,"
300,14,515,"Atrides came to Meges’ aid, and, hidden with his side,"
300,14,516,"Let loose a jav’lin at his foe, that through his back implied"
300,14,517,"His lusty head, ev’n past his breast; the ground receiv’d his weight."
300,14,518,"While these made in to spoil his arms, great Hector did excite"
300,14,519,All his allies to quick revenge; and first he wrought upon
300,14,520,"Strong Manalippus, that was son to great Hycetaon,"
300,14,521,"With some reproof. Before these wars, he in Percote fed"
300,14,522,"Clov’n - foot’d oxen, but did since return where he was bred,"
300,14,523,"Excell’d amongst the Ilians, was much of Priam lov’d,"
300,14,524,And in his court kept as his son. Him Hector thus reprov’d:
300,14,525,"“Thus, Menalippus, shall our blood accuse us of neglect?"
300,14,526,"Nor moves it thy lov’d heart, thus urg’d, thy kinsman to protect?"
300,14,527,"Seest thou not how they seek his spoil? Come, follow, now no more"
300,14,528,"Our fight must stand at length, but close; nor leave the close before"
300,14,529,"We close the latest eye of them, or they the lowest stone"
300,14,530,"Tear up, and sack the citizens of lofty Ilion.”"
300,14,531,"He led; he follow’d, like a God. And then must Ajax needs,"
300,14,532,"As well as Hector, cheer his men, and thus their spirits he feeds:"
300,14,533,"“Good friends, bring but yourselves to feel the noble stings of shame"
300,14,534,"For what ye suffer, and be men. Respect each other’s fame;"
300,14,535,"For which who strives in shame’s fit fear, and puts on ne’er so far,"
300,14,536,Comes oft’ner off. Then stick engag’d; these fugitives of war
300,14,537,"Save neither life, nor get renown, nor bear more mind than sheep.”"
300,14,538,"This short speech fir’d them in his aid, his spirit touch’d them deep,"
300,14,539,And turn’d them all before the fleet into a wall of brass;
300,14,540,"To whose assault Jove stirr’d their foes, and young Atrides was"
300,14,541,"Jove’s instrument, who thus set on the young Antilochus:"
300,14,542,"“Antilochus, in all our host, there is not one of us"
300,14,543,"More young than thou, more swift of foot, nor, with both those, so"
300,14,544,strong.
300,14,545,"O would thou wouldst then, for thou canst, one of this lusty throng,"
300,14,546,"That thus comes skipping out before (whoever, any where)"
300,14,547,"Make stick, for my sake, ’twixt both hosts, and leave his bold blood"
300,14,548,there!”
300,14,549,"He said no sooner, and retir’d, but forth he rush’d before"
300,14,550,"The foremost fighters, yet his eye did ev’ry way explore"
300,14,551,For doubt of odds; out flew his lance; the Trojans did abstain
300,14,552,"While he was darting; yet his dart he cast not off in vain,"
300,14,553,"For Menalippus, that rare son of great Hycetaon,"
300,14,554,"As bravely he put forth to fight, it fiercely flew upon;"
300,14,555,"And at the nipple of his breast, his breast and life did part."
300,14,556,"And then, much like an eager hound, cast off at some young hart"
300,14,557,"Hurt by the hunter, that had left his covert then but new,"
300,14,558,"The great - in - war Antilochus, O Menalippus, flew"
300,14,559,On thy torn bosom for thy spoil. But thy death could not lie
300,14,560,"Hid to great Hector; who all haste made to thee, and made fly"
300,14,561,"Antilochus, although in war he were at all parts skill’d."
300,14,562,"But as some wild beast, having done some shrewd turn (either kill’d"
300,14,563,"The herdsman, or the herdsman’s dog) and skulks away before"
300,14,564,"The gather’d multitude makes in; so Nestor’s son forbore,"
300,14,565,"But after him, with horrid cries, both Hector and the rest"
300,14,566,Show’rs of tear - thirsty lances pour’d; who having arm’d his breast
300,14,567,"With all his friends, he turn’d it then. Then on the ships all Troy,"
300,14,568,"Like raw - flesh - nourish’d lions, rush’d, and knew they did employ"
300,14,569,Their pow’rs to perfect Jove’s high will; who still their spirits
300,14,570,"enflam’d,"
300,14,571,"And quench’d the Grecians’; one renown’d, the other often sham’d."
300,14,572,"For Hector’s glory still he stood, and ever went about"
300,14,573,"To make him cast the fleet such fire, as never should go out;"
300,14,574,"Heard Thetis’ foul petitión, and wish’d in any wise"
300,14,575,The splendour of the burning ships might satiate his eyes.
300,14,576,"From him yet the repulse was then to be on Troy conferr’d,"
300,14,577,"The honour of it giv’n the Greeks; which thinking on, he stirr’d,"
300,14,578,"With such addition of his spirit, the spirit Hector bore"
300,14,579,"To burn the fleet, that of itself was hot enough before."
300,14,580,"But now he far’d like Mars himself, so brandishing his lance"
300,14,581,"As, through the deep shades of a wood, a raging fire should glance,"
300,14,582,Held up to all eyes by a hill; about his lips a foam
300,14,583,"Stood as when th’ ocean is enrag’d, his eyes were overcome"
300,14,584,"With fervour, and resembled flames, set off by his dark brows,"
300,14,585,And from his temples his bright helm abhorréd lightnings throws;
300,14,586,"For Jove, from forth the sphere of stars, to his state put his own,"
300,14,587,And all the blaze of both the hosts confin’d in him alone.
300,14,588,"And all this was, since after this he had not long to live,"
300,14,589,"This lightning flew before his death, which Pallas was to give"
300,14,590,"(A small time thence, and now prepar’d) beneath the violence"
300,14,591,"Of great Pelides. In mean time, his present eminence"
300,14,592,"Thought all things under it; and he, still where he saw the stands"
300,14,593,"Of greatest strength and bravest arm’d, there he would prove his hands,"
300,14,594,"Or nowhere; off’ring to break through, but that pass’d all his pow’r,"
300,14,595,"Although his will were past all theirs, they stood him like a tow’r"
300,14,596,"Conjoin’d so firm, that as a rock, exceeding high and great,"
300,14,597,"And standing near the hoary sea, bears many a boist’rous threat"
300,14,598,"Of high - voic’d winds and billows huge, belch’d on it by the storms;"
300,14,599,"So stood the Greeks great Hector’s charge, nor stirr’d their battellous"
300,14,600,forms.
300,14,601,"He, girt in fire borne for the fleet, still rush’d at ev’ry troop,"
300,14,602,"And fell upon it like a wave, high rais’d, that then doth stoop"
300,14,603,"Out from the clouds, grows, as it stoops, with storms, then down doth"
300,14,604,come
300,14,605,"And cuff a ship, when all her sides are hid in brackish foam,"
300,14,606,"Strong gales still raging in her sails, her sailors’ minds dismay’d,"
300,14,607,Death being but little from their lives; so Jove - like Hector fray’d
300,14,608,"And plied the Greeks, who knew not what would chance, for all their"
300,14,609,guards.
300,14,610,"And as the baneful king of beasts, leapt into oxen herds"
300,14,611,"Fed in the meadows of a fen, exceeding great; the beasts"
300,14,612,In number infinite; ’mongst whom (their herdsmen wanting breasts
300,14,613,"To fight with lions, for the price of a black ox’s life)"
300,14,614,"He here and there jumps, first and last, in his blood - thirsty strife,"
300,14,615,"Chas’d and assaulted; and, at length, down in the midst goes one,"
300,14,616,And all the rest spers’d through the fen; so now all Greece was gone;
300,14,617,"So Hector, in a flight from heav’n upon the Grecians cast,"
300,14,618,"Turn’d all their backs; yet only one his deadly lance laid fast,"
300,14,619,"Brave Mycenæus Periphes, Cypræus’ dearest son,"
300,14,620,"Who of the heav’n’s - Queen - lovéd king, great Eurysthæus, won"
300,14,621,"The grace to greet in ambassy the strength of Hercules,"
300,14,622,"Was far superior to his sire in feet, fight, nobleness"
300,14,623,"Of all the virtues, and all those did such a wisdom guide"
300,14,624,"As all Mycena could not match; and this man dignified,"
300,14,625,"Still making greater his renown, the state of Priam’s son,"
300,14,626,"For his unhappy hasty foot, as he address’d to run,"
300,14,627,"Stuck in th’ extreme ring of his shield, that to his ancles reach’d,"
300,14,628,"And down he upwards fell, his fall up from the centre fetch’d"
300,14,629,"A huge sound with his head and helm; which Hector quickly spied,"
300,14,630,"Ran in, and in his worthy breast his lance’s head did hide;"
300,14,631,"And slew about him all his friends, who could not give him aid,"
300,14,632,"They griev’d, and of his god - like foe fled so extreme afraid."
300,14,633,"And now amongst the nearest ships, that first were drawn to shore,"
300,14,634,"The Greeks were driv’n; beneath whose sides, behind them, and before,"
300,14,635,"And into them they pour’d themselves, and thence were driv’n again"
300,14,636,"Up to their tents, and there they stood; not daring to maintain"
300,14,637,"Their guards more outward, but, betwixt the bounds of fear and shame,"
300,14,638,"Cheer’d still each other; when th’ old man, that of the Grecian name"
300,14,639,"Was call’d the Pillar, ev’ry man thus by his parents pray’d:"
300,14,640,"“O friends, be men, and in your minds let others’ shames be weigh’d."
300,14,641,"Know you have friends besides yourselves, possessions, parents, wives,"
300,14,642,"As well those that are dead to you, as those ye love with lives;"
300,14,643,"All sharing still their good, or bad, with yours. By these I pray,"
300,14,644,That are not present (and the more should therefore make ye weigh
300,14,645,"Their miss of you, as yours of them) that you will bravely stand,"
300,14,646,"And this forc’d flight you have sustain’d, at length yet countermand.”"
300,14,647,Supplies of good words thus supplied the deeds and spirits of all.
300,14,648,"And so at last Minerva clear’d, the cloud that Jove let fall"
300,14,649,"Before their eyes; a mighty light flew beaming ev’ry way,"
300,14,650,"As well about their ships, as where their darts did hottest play,"
300,14,651,"Then saw they Hector great in arms, and his associates,"
300,14,652,"As well all those that then abstain’d, as those that help’d the fates,"
300,14,653,And all their own fight at the fleet. Nor did it now content
300,14,654,"Ajax to keep down like the rest; he up the hatches went,"
300,14,655,"Stalk’d here and there, and in his hand a huge great bead - hook held,"
300,14,656,"Twelve cubits long, and full of iron. And as a man well - skill’d"
300,14,657,"In horse, made to the martial race, when, of a number more,"
300,14,658,"He chooseth four, and brings them forth, to run them all before"
300,14,659,"Swarms of admiring citizens, amids their town’s high way,"
300,14,660,"And, in their full career, he leaps from one to one, no stay"
300,14,661,"Enforc’d on any, nor fails he, in either seat or leap;"
300,14,662,"So Ajax with his bead - hook leap’d nimbly from ship to ship,"
300,14,663,"As actively commanding all, them in their men as well"
300,14,664,"As men in them, most terribly exhorting to repell,"
300,14,665,To save their navy and their tents. But Hector nothing needs
300,14,666,"To stand on exhortations now at home, he strives for deeds."
300,14,667,"And look how Jove’s great queen of birds, sharp - set, looks out for"
300,14,668,"prey,"
300,14,669,"Knows floods that nourish wild - wing’d fowls, and, from her airy way,"
300,14,670,"Beholds where cranes, swans, cormorants, have made their foody fall,"
300,14,671,"Darkens the river with her wings, and stoops amongst them all;"
300,14,672,"So Hector flew amongst the Greeks, directing his command,"
300,14,673,"In chief, against one opposite ship; Jove with a mighty hand"
300,14,674,Still backing him and all his men. And then again there grew
300,14,675,A bitter conflict at the fleet. You would have said none drew
300,14,676,"A weary breath, nor ever would, they laid so freshly on."
300,14,677,And this was it that fir’d them both: The Greeks did build upon
300,14,678,"No hope but what the field would yield, flight an impossible course;"
300,14,679,"The Trojans all hope entertain’d, that sword and fire should force"
300,14,680,"Both ships and lives of all the Greeks. And thus, unlike affects"
300,14,681,Bred like strenuity in both. Great Hector still directs
300,14,682,His pow’rs against the first near ship. ’Twas that fair bark that
300,14,683,brought
300,14,684,"Protesilaus to those wars, and now her self to nought,"
300,14,685,"With many Greek and Trojan lives, all spoil’d about her spoil."
300,14,686,"One slew another desp’rately, and close the deadly toil"
300,14,687,"Was pitch’d on both parts. Not a shaft, nor far - off striking dart"
300,14,688,"Was us’d through all. One fight fell out, of one despiteful heart."
300,14,689,"Sharp axes, twybills, two - hand swords, and spears with two heads borne,"
300,14,690,"Were then the weapons; fair short swords, with sanguine hilts still"
300,14,691,"worn,"
300,14,692,"Had use in like sort; of which last, ye might have numbers view’d"
300,14,693,"Drop with dissolv’d arms from their hands, as many down - right hew’d"
300,14,694,"From off their shoulders as they fought, their bawdrics cut in twain."
300,14,695,"And thus the black blood flow’d on earth, from soldiers hurt and slain."
300,14,696,"When Hector once had seiz’d the ship, he clapt his fair broad hand"
300,14,697,"Fast on the stern, and held it there, and there gave this command:"
300,14,698,"“Bring fire, and all together shout. Now Jove hath drawn the veil"
300,14,699,"From such a day as makes amends, for all his storms of hail;"
300,14,700,"By whose blest light we take those ships, that, in despite of heav’n,"
300,14,701,"Took sea, and brought us worlds of woe, all since our peers were giv’n"
300,14,702,To such a laziness and fear; they would not let me end
300,14,703,"Our ling’ring banes, and charge thus home, but keep home and defend,"
300,14,704,And so they rul’d the men I led. But though Jove then withheld
300,14,705,"My natural spirit, now by Jove ’tis freed, and thus impell’d.”"
300,14,706,This more inflam’d them; in so much that Ajax now no more
300,14,707,"Kept up, he was so drown’d in darts; a little he forbore"
300,14,708,"The hatches to a seat beneath, of sev’n foot long, but thought"
300,14,709,"It was impossible to scape; he sat yet where he fought,"
300,14,710,"And hurl’d out lances thick as hail, at all men that assay’d"
300,14,711,"To fire the ship; with whom he found his hands so overlaid,"
300,14,712,"That on his soldiers thus he cried: “O friends, fight I alone?"
300,14,713,"Expect ye more walls at your backs? Towns rampir’d here are none,"
300,14,714,"No citizens to take ye in, no help of any kind."
300,14,715,"We are, I tell you, in Troy’s fields; have nought but seas behind,"
300,14,716,"And foes before; far, far from Greece. For shame, obey commands,"
300,14,717,There is no mercy in the wars; your healths lie in your hands.”
300,14,718,"Thus rag’d he, and pour’d out his darts. Whoever he espied"
300,14,719,"Come near the vessel arm’d with fire, on his fierce dart he died."
300,14,720,"All that pleas’d Hector made him mad, all that his thanks would earn;"
300,14,721,"Of which twelve men, his most resolv’d, lay dead before his stern."
300,14,722,THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH BOOK.
300,15,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,15,2,"Achilles, at Patroclus’ suit, doth yield"
300,15,3,"His arms and Myrmidons; which brought to field,"
300,15,4,The Trojans fly. Patroclus hath the grace
300,15,5,"Of great Sarpedon’s death, sprung of the race"
300,15,6,"Of Jupiter, he having slain the horse"
300,15,7,"Of Thetis’ son, fierce Pedasus. The force"
300,15,8,Of Hector doth revenge the much - rued end
300,15,9,Of most renown’d Sarpedon on the friend
300,15,10,"Of Thetides, first by Euphorbus harm’d,"
300,15,11,And by Apollo’s personal pow’r disarm’d.
300,15,12,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,15,13,In Πι̑ Patroclus bears the chance
300,15,14,"Of death, impos’d by Hector’s lance."
300,15,15,Thus fighting for this well - built ship; Patroclus all that space
300,15,16,"Stood by his friend, preparing words to win the Greeks his grace,"
300,15,17,"With pow’r of uncontainéd tears; and, like a fountain pour’d"
300,15,18,"In black streams from a lofty rock, the Greeks so plagu’d deplor’d."
300,15,19,"Achilles, ruthful for his tears, said: “Wherefore weeps my friend"
300,15,20,"So like a girl, who, though she sees her mother cannot tend"
300,15,21,"Her childish humours, hangs on her, and would be taken up,"
300,15,22,"Still viewing her with tear - drown’d eyes, when she hath made her stoop,"
300,15,23,To nothing liker I can shape thy so unseemly tears.
300,15,24,What causeth them? Hath any ill solicited thine ears
300,15,25,"Befall’n my Myrmidons? Or news from lovéd Phthia brought,"
300,15,26,"Told only thee, lest I should grieve, and therefore thus hath wrought"
300,15,27,"On thy kind spirit? Actor’s son, the good Menœtius,"
300,15,28,"Thy father, lives, and Peleus, mine, great son of Æacus,"
300,15,29,"Amongst his Myrmidons; whose deaths, in duty we should mourn,"
300,15,30,"Or is it what the Greeks sustain, that doth thy stomach turn,"
300,15,31,"On whom, for their injustice’ sake, plagues are so justly laid?"
300,15,32,"Speak, man, let both know either’s heart.” Patroclus, sighing, said:"
300,15,33,"“O Peleus’ son, thou strongest Greek by all degrees that lives,"
300,15,34,"Still be not angry, our sad state such cause of pity gives,"
300,15,35,"Our greatest Greeks lie at their ships sore wounded; Ithacus,"
300,15,36,"King Agamemnon, Diomed, and good Eurypylus;"
300,15,37,"But these much - med’cine - knowing men, physicians, can recure,"
300,15,38,"Thou yet unmed’cinable still, though thy wound all endure,"
300,15,39,"Heav’n bless my bosom from such wrath as thou sooth’st as thy bliss,"
300,15,40,"Unprofitably virtuous. How shall our progenies,"
300,15,41,"Born in thine age, enjoy thine aid, when these friends, in thy flow’r,"
300,15,42,"Thou leav’st to such unworthy death? O idle, cruel pow’r!"
300,15,43,"Great Peleus never did beget, nor Thetis bring forth thee,"
300,15,44,"Thou from the blue sea, and her rocks, deriv’st thy pedigree,"
300,15,45,"What so declines thee? If thy mind shuns any augury,"
300,15,46,"Related by thy mother - queen from heav’n’s foreseeing eye,"
300,15,47,"And therefore thou forsak’st thy friends, let me go ease their moans"
300,15,48,"With those brave relics of our host, thy mighty Myrmidons,"
300,15,49,That I may bring to field more light to conquest than hath been.
300,15,50,"To which end grace me with thine arms, since, any shadow seen"
300,15,51,"Of thy resemblance, all the pow’r of perjur’d Troy will fly,"
300,15,52,And our so - tiréd friend’s will breathe; our fresh - set - on supply
300,15,53,"Will eas’ly drive their wearied off.” Thus, foolish man, he sued"
300,15,54,For his sure death; of all whose speech Achilles first renew’d
300,15,55,"The last part thus: “O worthy friend, what have thy speeches been?"
300,15,56,"I shun the fight for oracles, or what my mother queen"
300,15,57,"Hath told from Jove? I take no care, nor note of one such thing!"
300,15,58,"But this fit anger stings me still, that the insulting king"
300,15,59,"Should from his equal take his right, since he exceeds in pow’r."
300,15,60,"This, still his wrong, is still my grief: He took my paramour"
300,15,61,"That all men gave, and whom I won by virtue of my spear,"
300,15,62,"That, for her, overturn’d a town. This rape he made of her,"
300,15,63,"And used me like a fugitive, an inmate in a town,"
300,15,64,"That is no city libertine, nor capable of their gown."
300,15,65,"But bear we this as out of date; ’tis past, nor must we still"
300,15,66,"Feed anger in our noblest parts; yet thus, I have my will"
300,15,67,"As well as our great king of men, for I did ever vow"
300,15,68,"Never to cast off my disdain till, as it falls out now,"
300,15,69,"Their miss of me knock’d at my fleet, and told me in their cries"
300,15,70,"I was reveng’d, and had my wish of all my enemies."
300,15,71,"And so of this repeat enough. Take thou my fame - blaz’d arms,"
300,15,72,And my fight - thirsty Myrmidons lead to these hot alarms.
300,15,73,Whole clouds of Trojans circle us with hateful eminence;
300,15,74,"The Greeks shut in a little shore, a sort of citizens"
300,15,75,Skipping upon them; all because their proud eyes do not see
300,15,76,"The radiance of my helmet there, whose beams had instantly"
300,15,77,"Thrust back, and all these ditches fill’d with carrion of their flesh,"
300,15,78,"If Agamemnon had been kind; where now they fight as fresh,"
300,15,79,"As thus far they had put at ease, and at our tents contend."
300,15,80,And may; for the repulsive hand of Diomed doth not spend
300,15,81,"His raging darts there, that their death could fright out of our fleet;"
300,15,82,"Nor from that head of enmity, can my poor hearers meet"
300,15,83,The voice of great Atrides now. Now Hector’s only voice
300,15,84,"Breaks all the air about both hosts, and, with the very noise"
300,15,85,"Bred by his loud encouragements, his forces fill the field,"
300,15,86,"And fight the poor Achaians down. But on, put thou my shield"
300,15,87,"Betwixt the fire - plague and our fleet. Rush bravely on, and turn"
300,15,88,War’s tide as headlong on their throats. No more let them ajourn
300,15,89,Our sweet home - turning. But observe the charge I lay on thee
300,15,90,"To each least point, that thy rul’d hand may highly honour me,"
300,15,91,"And get such glory from the Greeks, that they may send again"
300,15,92,"My most sweet wench, and gifts to boot, when thou hast cast a rein"
300,15,93,"On these so headstrong citizens, and forc’d them from our fleet."
300,15,94,With which grace if the God of sounds thy kind egression greet;[1]
300,15,95,"Retire, and be not tempted on (with pride to see thy hand"
300,15,96,Rain slaughter’d carcasses on earth) to run forth thy command
300,15,97,"As far as Ilion, lest the Gods, that favour Troy, come forth"
300,15,98,"To thy encounter, for the Sun much loves it; and my worth,"
300,15,99,"In what thou suffer’st, will be wrong’d, that I would let my friend"
300,15,100,"Assume an action of such weight without me, and transcend"
300,15,101,His friend’s prescription. Do not then affect a further fight
300,15,102,"Than I may strengthen. Let the rest, when thou hast done this right,"
300,15,103,"Perform the rest. O would to Jove, thou Pallas, and thou Sun,"
300,15,104,"That not a man hous’d underneath those tow’rs of Ilion,"
300,15,105,"Nor anyone of all the Greeks, how infinite a sum"
300,15,106,"Soever all together make, might live unovercome;"
300,15,107,"But only we two, ’scaping death, might have the thund’ring down"
300,15,108,Of ev’ry stone stuck in the walls of this so sacred town!”
300,15,109,Thus spake they only ’twixt themselves. And now the foe no more
300,15,110,"Could Ajax stand, being so oppress’d with all the iron store"
300,15,111,"The Trojans pour’d on; with whose darts, and with Jove’s will beside,"
300,15,112,"His pow’rs were cloy’d, and his bright helm did deaf’ning blows abide,"
300,15,113,"His plume, and all bead - ornaments, could never hang in rest."
300,15,114,"His arm yet labour’d up his shield, and having done their best,"
300,15,115,"They could not stir him from his stand, although he wrought it out"
300,15,116,"With short respirings, and with sweat, that ceaseless flow’d about"
300,15,117,His reeking limbs; no least time giv’n to take in any breath;
300,15,118,"Ill strengthen’d ill; when one was up, another was beneath."
300,15,119,"Now, Muses, you that dwell in heav’n, the dreadful mean inspire,"
300,15,120,"That first enforc’d the Grecian fleet, to take in Trojan fire."
300,15,121,"First Hector, with his huge broad sword, cut off, at setting on,"
300,15,122,"The head of Ajax’ ashen lance; which Ajax seeing gone,"
300,15,123,"And that he shook a headless spear, a little while unware,"
300,15,124,His wary spirits told him straight the hand of Heav’n was there;
300,15,125,"And trembling under his conceit, which was that ’twas Jove’s deed,"
300,15,126,"Who, as be poll’d off his dart’s heads, so sure he had decreed"
300,15,127,"That all the counsels of their war, he would poll off like it,"
300,15,128,"And give the Trojans victory; so trusted he his wit,"
300,15,129,And left his darts. And then the ship was heap’d with horrid brands
300,15,130,Of kindling fire; which instantly was seen through all the strands
300,15,131,"In unextinguishable flames, that all the ship embrac’d."
300,15,132,"And then Achilles beat his thighs, cried out, “Patroclus, haste,"
300,15,133,"Make way with horse. I see at fleet, a fire of fearful rage."
300,15,134,"Arm, arm, lest all our fleet it fire, and all our pow’r engage."
300,15,135,"Arm quickly, I’ll bring up the troops.” To these so dreadful wars"
300,15,136,"Patroclus, in Achilles’ arms, enlighten’d all with stars,"
300,15,137,"And richly amell’d, all haste made. He wore his sword, his shield,"
300,15,138,"His huge - plum’d helm, and two such spears, as he could nimbly wield."
300,15,139,"But the most fam’d Achilles’ spear, big, solid, full of weight,"
300,15,140,He only left of all his arms; for that far pass’d the might
300,15,141,Of any Greek to shake but his; Achilles’ only ire
300,15,142,"Shook that huge weapon, that was giv’n by Chiron to his sire,"
300,15,143,"Cut from the top of Pelion, to be heroës’ deaths."
300,15,144,"His steeds Automedon straight join’d; like whom no man that breathes,"
300,15,145,"Next Peleus’ son, Patroclus lov’d; for, like him, none so great"
300,15,146,"He found in faith at ev’ry fight, nor to out - look a threat,"
300,15,147,"Automedon did therefore guide for him Achilles’ steeds,"
300,15,148,"Xanthius and Balius swift as wind, begotten by the seeds"
300,15,149,"Of Zephyr, and the Harpy born, Podarge, in a mead"
300,15,150,"Close to the wavy oceán, where that fierce Harpy fed."
300,15,151,"Automedon join’d these before, and with the hindmost gears"
300,15,152,"He fasten’d famous Pedasus, whom, from the massacres"
300,15,153,"Made by Achilles, when he took Eëtion’s wealthy town,"
300,15,154,"He brought, and, though of mortal race, yet gave him the renown"
300,15,155,"To follow his immortal horse. And now, before his tents,"
300,15,156,"Himself had seen his Myrmidons, in all habiliments"
300,15,157,"Of dreadful war. And when ye see, upon a mountain bred,[2]"
300,15,158,"A den of wolves, about whose hearts unmeasur’d strengths are fed,"
300,15,159,"New come from currie of a stag, their jaws all blood - besmear’d,"
300,15,160,"And when from some black - water fount they all together herd,"
300,15,161,"There having plentifully lapp’d, with thin and thrust out tongues,"
300,15,162,"The top and clearest of the spring, go belching from their lungs"
300,15,163,"The clotter’d gore, look dreadfully, and entertain no dread,"
300,15,164,"Their bellies gaunt all taken up, with being so rawly fed;"
300,15,165,"Then say, that such, in strength and look, were great Achilles’ men"
300,15,166,Now order’d for the dreadful fight; and so with all them then
300,15,167,"Their princes and their chiefs did show, about their Gen’ral’s friend;"
300,15,168,"His friend, and all, about himself; who chiefly did intend"
300,15,169,"Th’ embattelling of horse and foot. To that siege, held so long,"
300,15,170,"Twice - five - and - twenty sail he brought, twice - five - and - twenty strong"
300,15,171,Of able men was ev’rv sail. Five colonels he made
300,15,172,"Of all those forces; trusty men, and all of pow’r to lead,"
300,15,173,"But he of pow’r beyond them all. Menesthius was one,"
300,15,174,That ever wore discolour’d arms; he was a river’s son
300,15,175,"That fell from heav’n, and good to drink was his delightful stream,"
300,15,176,"His name unwearied Sperchius, he lov’d the lovely dame"
300,15,177,"Fair Polydora, Peleus’ seed, and dear in Borus’ sight,"
300,15,178,"And she to that celestial Flood gave this Menesthius light,"
300,15,179,A woman mixing with a God. Yet Borus bore the name
300,15,180,"Of father to Menesthius, he marrying the dame,"
300,15,181,And giving her a mighty dow’r; he was the kind descent
300,15,182,"Of Perieres. The next man, renown’d with regiment,"
300,15,183,"Was strong Eudorus, brought to life by one suppos’d a maid,"
300,15,184,"Bright Polymela, Phylas’ seed, but had the wanton play’d"
300,15,185,"With Argus - killing Mercury; who (fir’d with her fair eyes,"
300,15,186,As she was singing in the quire of Her that makes the cries
300,15,187,"In clam’rous hunting, and doth bear the crooked bow of gold)"
300,15,188,"Stole to her bed in that chaste room, that Phœbe chaste did hold,"
300,15,189,"And gave her that swift - warlike son, Eudorus, brought to light"
300,15,190,"As she was dancing; but as soon, as She that rules the plight"
300,15,191,"Of labouring women eas’d her throes, and show’d her son the sun,"
300,15,192,"Strong Echecæus, Actor’s heir, woo’d earnestly, and won"
300,15,193,"Her second favour, feeing her with gifts of infinite prize;"
300,15,194,"And after brought her to his house, where, in his grandsire’s eyes,"
300,15,195,"Old Phylas, Polymela’s son obtain’d exceeding grace,"
300,15,196,"And found as careful bringing up, as of his natural race"
300,15,197,He had descended. The third chief was fair Mæmalides
300,15,198,"Pisandrus, who in skill of darts obtain’d supremest praise"
300,15,199,"Of all the Myrmidons, except their lord’s companion."
300,15,200,"The fourth charge, aged Phœnix had. The fifth, Alcimedon,"
300,15,201,"Son of Laerces, and much fam’d. All these digested thus"
300,15,202,"In fit place by the mighty son of royal Peleüs,"
300,15,203,"This stern remembrance he gave all: “You, Myrmidons,” said he,"
300,15,204,“Lest any of you should forget his threat’nings us’d to me
300,15,205,"In this place, and, through all the time, that my just anger reign’d,"
300,15,206,"Attempting me with bitter words, for being so restrain’d,"
300,15,207,"For my hot humour, from the fight, remember them as these:"
300,15,208,"‘Thou cruel son of Peleüs, whom She that rules the seas"
300,15,209,"Did only nourish with her gall, thou dost ungently hold"
300,15,210,"Our hands against our wills from fight. We will not be controll’d,"
300,15,211,"But take our ships, and sail for home, before we loiter here"
300,15,212,And feed thy fury.’ These high words exceeding often were
300,15,213,"The threats that, in your mutinous troops, ye us’d to me for wrath"
300,15,214,"To be detain’d so from the field. Now then, your spleens may bathe"
300,15,215,"In sweat of those great works ye wish’d; now, he that can employ"
300,15,216,"A gen’rous heart, go fight, and fright these bragging sons of Troy.”"
300,15,217,"This set their minds and strengths on fire, the speech enforcing well,"
300,15,218,"Being us’d in time; but, being their king’s, it much more did impell,"
300,15,219,"And closer rush’d in all the troops. And as, for buildings high,"
300,15,220,"The mason lays his stones more thick, against th’ extremity"
300,15,221,"Of wind and weather, and ev’n then, if any storm arise,"
300,15,222,"He thickens them the more for that, the present act so plies"
300,15,223,"His honest mind to make sure work; so, for the high estate"
300,15,224,"This work was brought to, these men’s minds, according to the rate,"
300,15,225,"Were rais’d, and all their bodies join’d; but their well - spoken king,"
300,15,226,"With his so timely - thought - on speech, more sharp made valour’s sting,"
300,15,227,"And thicken’d so their targets boss’d, so all their helmets then,"
300,15,228,"That shields propp’d shields, helms helmets knock’d, and men encourag’d"
300,15,229,men.
300,15,230,"Patroclus and Automedon did arm before them all,"
300,15,231,Two bodies with one mind inform’d; and then the General
300,15,232,"Betook him to his private tent, where from a coffer wrought"
300,15,233,"Most rich and curiously, and giv’n by Thetis to be brought"
300,15,234,"In his own ship, top - fill’d with vests, warm robes to check cold wind,"
300,15,235,"And tapestries all gold’n - fring’d, and curl’d with thrumbs behind,"
300,15,236,"He took a most unvalu’d bowl, in which none drank but he;"
300,15,237,"Nor he but to the Deities, nor any Deity"
300,15,238,But Jove himself was serv’d with that; and that he first did cleanse
300,15,239,"With sulphur, then with fluences of sweetest water rense;"
300,15,240,"Then wash’d his hands, and drew himself a mighty bowl of wine,"
300,15,241,"Which (standing midst the place enclos’d for services divine,"
300,15,242,"And looking up to heav’n and Jove, who saw him well) he pour’d"
300,15,243,"Upon the place of sacrifice, and humbly thus implor’d:"
300,15,244,"“Great Dodonæus, president of cold Dodone’s tow’rs,"
300,15,245,"Divine Pelasgicus, that dwellest far hence; about whose bow’rs"
300,15,246,"Th’ austere prophetic Selli dwell, that still sleep on the ground,"
300,15,247,"Go bare, and never cleanse their feet; as I before have found"
300,15,248,"Grace to my vows, and hurt to Greece, so now my pray’rs intend."
300,15,249,"I still stay in the gather’d fleet, but have dismiss’d my friend,"
300,15,250,"Amongst my many Myrmidons, to danger of the dart;"
300,15,251,"O grant his valour my renown, arm with my mind his heart!"
300,15,252,"That Hector’s self may know my friend can work in single war,"
300,15,253,"And not then only show his hands, so hot and singular,"
300,15,254,"When my kind presence seconds him. But, fight he ne’er so well,"
300,15,255,"No further let him trust his fight, but, when he shall repell"
300,15,256,"Clamour and danger from our fleet, vouchsafe a safe retreat"
300,15,257,"To him and all his companies, with fames and arms complete.”"
300,15,258,"He pray’d, and heav’n’s great Counsellor gave satisfying ear"
300,15,259,"To one part of his orisons, but left the other there;"
300,15,260,"He let him free the fleet of foes, but safe retreat denied."
300,15,261,"Achilles left that utter part where he his zeal applied,"
300,15,262,"And turn’d into his inner tent, made fast his cup, and then"
300,15,263,"Stood forth, and with his mind beheld the foes fight; and his men,"
300,15,264,"That follow’d his great - minded friend, embattled till they brake"
300,15,265,"With gallant spirit upon the foe. And as fell wasps, that make"
300,15,266,"Their dwellings in the broad high - way, which foolish children use"
300,15,267,(Their cottages being near their nests) to anger and abuse
300,15,268,"With ever vexing them, and breed (to soothe their childish war)"
300,15,269,"A common ill to many men, since if a traveller"
300,15,270,"(That would his journey’s end apply, and pass them unassay’d)"
300,15,271,"Come near and vex them, upon him the children’s faults are laid,"
300,15,272,"For on they fly as he were such, and still defend their own;"
300,15,273,"So far’d it with the fervent mind of ev’ry Myrmidon,"
300,15,274,"Who pour’d themselves out of their fleet upon their wanton foes,"
300,15,275,"That needs would stir them, thrust so near, and cause the overthrows"
300,15,276,"Of many others, that had else been never touch’d by them,"
300,15,277,"Nor would have touch’d. Patroclus then put his wind to the stream,"
300,15,278,"And thus exhorted: “Now, my friends, remember you express"
300,15,279,"Your late - urg’d virtue, and renown our great Æacides."
300,15,280,"That, he being strong’st of all the Greeks, his eminence may dim"
300,15,281,"All others likewise in our strengths, that far off imitate him:"
300,15,282,And Agamemnon now may see his fault as general
300,15,283,"As his place high, dishonouring him that so much honours all.”"
300,15,284,"Thus made he sparkle their fresh fire, and on they rush’d; the fleet"
300,15,285,"Fill’d full her hollow sides with sounds, that terribly did greet"
300,15,286,Th’ amazed Trojans; and their eyes did second their amaze
300,15,287,"When great Menœtius’ son they saw, and his friend’s armour blaze."
300,15,288,"All troops stood troubled, with conceit that Peleus’ son was there,"
300,15,289,His anger cast off at the ships; and each look’d ev’rywhere
300,15,290,For some authority to lead the then preparéd flight.
300,15,291,Patroclus greeted with a lance the region where the fight
300,15,292,"Made strongest tumult, near the ship Protesilaus brought,"
300,15,293,"And strook Pyræchmen; who before the fair - helmed Pæons fought,"
300,15,294,"Led from Amydon, near whose walls the broad - stream’d Axius flows."
300,15,295,"Through his right shoulder flew the dart, whose blow strook all the"
300,15,296,blows
300,15,297,"In his pow’r from his pow’rless arm, and down he groaning fell;"
300,15,298,"His men all flying, their leader fled. This one dart did repell"
300,15,299,"The whole guard plac’d about the ship, whose fire extinct, half burn’d"
300,15,300,"The Pæons left her, and full cry to clam’rous flight return’d."
300,15,301,Then spread the Greeks about their ships; triumphant tumult flow’d:
300,15,302,"And, as from top of some steep hill the Lightner strips a cloud,"
300,15,303,"And lets a great sky out from heav’n, in whose delightsome light"
300,15,304,"All prominent foreheads, forests, tow’rs, and temples cheer the sight;"
300,15,305,"So clear’d these Greeks this Trojan cloud, and at their ships and tents"
300,15,306,"Obtain’d a little time to breathe, but found no present vents"
300,15,307,"To their inclusions; nor did Troy, though these Pæonians fled,"
300,15,308,"Lose any ground, but from this ship they needfully turn’d head."
300,15,309,Then ev’ry man a man subdu’d. Patroclus in the thigh
300,15,310,"Strook Areilycus; his dart the bone did break, and fly"
300,15,311,"Quite through, and sunk him to the earth. Good Menelaus slew"
300,15,312,"Accomplish’d Thoas, in whose breast, being nak’d, his lance he threw"
300,15,313,"Above his shield, and freed his soul. Phylides, taking note"
300,15,314,"That bold Amphiclus bent at him, prevented him, and smote"
300,15,315,"His thigh’s extreme part, where of man his fattest muscle lies,"
300,15,316,"The nerves torn with his lance’s pile, and darkness clos’d his eyes."
300,15,317,"Antilochus Atymnius seiz’d, his steel lance did impress"
300,15,318,"His first three guts, and loos’d his life. At young Nestorides,"
300,15,319,"Maris, Atymnius’ brother, flew; and at him Thrasymed"
300,15,320,The brother to Antilochus; his eager jav’lin’s head
300,15,321,"The muscles of his arm cut out, and shiver’d all the bone;"
300,15,322,"Night clos’d his eyes, his lifeless corse his brother fell upon."
300,15,323,"And so by two kind brothers’ hands, did two kind brothers bleed;"
300,15,324,"Both being divine Sarpedon’s friends, and were the darting seed"
300,15,325,"Of Amisodarus, that kept the bane of many men"
300,15,326,Abhorr’d Chimæra; and such bane now caught his childeren.
300,15,327,"Ajax Oïliades did take Cleobulus alive,"
300,15,328,Invading him stay’d by the press; and at him then let drive
300,15,329,With his short sword that cut his neck; whose blood warm’d all the
300,15,330,"steel,"
300,15,331,And cold Death with a violent fate his sable eyes did seel.
300,15,332,"Peneleüs, and Lycon cast together off their darts;"
300,15,333,"Both miss’d, and both together then went with their swords; in parts"
300,15,334,"The blade and hilt went, laying on upon the helmet’s height."
300,15,335,"Peneleus’ sword caught Lycon’s neck, and cut it thorough quite."
300,15,336,"His head hung by the very skin. The swift Meriones,"
300,15,337,"Pursuing flying Acamas, just as he got access"
300,15,338,"To horse and chariot overtook, and took him such a blow"
300,15,339,"On his right shoulder, that he left his chariot, and did strow"
300,15,340,"The dusty earth; life left his limbs, and night his eyes possess’d."
300,15,341,"Idomenæus his stern dart at Erymas address’d,"
300,15,342,"As, like to Acamas, he fled; it cut the sundry bones"
300,15,343,"Beneath his brain, betwixt his neck, and foreparts; and so runs,"
300,15,344,"Shaking his teeth out, through his mouth, his eyes all drown’d in"
300,15,345,"blood,"
300,15,346,"So through his nostrils and his mouth, that now dart - open stood,"
300,15,347,He breath’d his spirit. Thus had death from ev’ry Grecian chief
300,15,348,"A chief of Troy. For, as to kids, or lambs, their cruell’st thief,"
300,15,349,"The wolf, steals in, and, when he sees that by the shepherd’s sloth"
300,15,350,"The dams are spers’d about the hills, then serves his rav’nous tooth"
300,15,351,"With ease, because his prey is weak; so serv’d the Greeks their foes,"
300,15,352,"Discerning well how shrieking flight did all their spirits dispose,"
300,15,353,Their biding virtues quite forgot. And now the natural spleen
300,15,354,"That Ajax bore to Hector still, by all means, would have been"
300,15,355,"Within his bosom with a dart; but he that knew the war,"
300,15,356,"Well - cover’d in a well - lin’d shield, did well perceive how far"
300,15,357,"The arrows and the jav’lins reach’d, by being within their sounds"
300,15,358,And ominous singings; and observ’d the there - in - clining bounds
300,15,359,"Of Conquest in her aid of him, and so obey’d her change,"
300,15,360,"Took safest course for him and his, and stood to her as strange."
300,15,361,"And as, when Jove intends a storm, he lets out of the stars,"
300,15,362,"From steep Olympus, a black cloud, that all heav’n’s splendour bars"
300,15,363,From men on earth; so from the hearts of all the Trojan host
300,15,364,"All comfort lately found from Jove, in flight and cries was lost."
300,15,365,Nor made they any fair retreat. Hector’s unruly horse
300,15,366,"Would needs retire him, and he left engag’d his Trojan force,"
300,15,367,"Forc’d by the steepness of the dike, that in ill place they took,"
300,15,368,And kept them that would fain have gone. Their horses quite forsook
300,15,369,"A number of the Trojan kings, and left them in the dike;"
300,15,370,Their chariots in their foreteams broke. Patroclus then did strike
300,15,371,"While steel was hot, and cheer’d his friends; nor meant his enemies"
300,15,372,"good,"
300,15,373,"Who, when they once began to fly, each way receiv’d a flood,"
300,15,374,And chok’d themselves with drifts of dust. And now were clouds begot
300,15,375,Beneath the clouds; with flight and noise the horse neglected not
300,15,376,"Their home intendments; and, where rout was busiest, there pour’d on"
300,15,377,Patroclus most exhorts and threats; and then lay overthrown
300,15,378,"Numbers beneath their axle - trees; who, lying in flight’s stream,"
300,15,379,"Made th’ after chariots jot and jump, in driving over them."
300,15,380,"Th’ immortal horse Patroclus rode, did pass the dike with ease,"
300,15,381,And wish’d the depth and danger more; and Menœtiades
300,15,382,"As great a spirit had to reach, retiring Hector’s haste,"
300,15,383,"But his fleet horse had too much law, and fetch’d him off too fast."
300,15,384,And as in Autumn the black earth is loaden with the storms
300,15,385,"That Jove in gluts of rain pours down, being angry with the forms"
300,15,386,"Of judgment in authoriz’d men, that in their courts maintain,"
300,15,387,"With violent office, wrested laws, and (fearing Gods, nor men)"
300,15,388,"Exile all justice; for whose fault, whole fields are overflown,"
300,15,389,And many valleys cut away with torrents headlong thrown
300,15,390,"From neighbour mountains, till the sea receive them roaring in,"
300,15,391,"And judg’d men’s labours then are vain, plagu’d for their judge’s sin;"
300,15,392,So now the foul defaults of some all Troy were laid upon;
300,15,393,So like those torrents roar’d they back to windy Ilion;
300,15,394,And so like tempests blew the horse with ravishing back again
300,15,395,"Those hot assailants, all their works at fleet now render’d vain."
300,15,396,"Patroclus, when he had dispers’d the foremost phalanxes,"
300,15,397,"Call’d back his forces to the fleet, and would not let them prease,"
300,15,398,"As they desir’d, too near the town; but ’twixt the ships and flood,"
300,15,399,"And their steep rampire, his hand steep’d Revenge in seas of blood."
300,15,400,"Then Pronous was first that fell beneath his fi’ry lance,"
300,15,401,"Which strook his bare breast, near his shield. The second Thestor’s"
300,15,402,"chance,"
300,15,403,"Old Enops’ son, did make himself; who shrinking, and set close"
300,15,404,"In his fair seat, ev’n with th’ approach Patroclus made, did lose"
300,15,405,"All manly courage, insomuch that from his hands his reins"
300,15,406,"Fell flowing down, and his right jaw Patroclus’ lance attains,"
300,15,407,"Strock through his teeth, and there it stuck, and by it to him drew"
300,15,408,"Dead Thestor to his chariot. It show’d, as when you view"
300,15,409,An angler from some prominent rock draw with his line and hook
300,15,410,A mighty fish out of the sea; for so the Greek did pluck
300,15,411,"The Trojan gaping from his seat, his jaws op’d with the dart;"
300,15,412,"Which when Patroclus drew, he fell; his life and breast did part."
300,15,413,"Then rush’d he on Erylaus; at whom he hurl’d a stone,"
300,15,414,"Which strake his head so in the midst, that two was made of one;"
300,15,415,"Two ways it fell, cleft through his casque. And then Tlepolemus,"
300,15,416,"Epaltes, Damastorides, Evippus, Echius,"
300,15,417,"Ipheas, bold Amphoterus, and valiant Erymas,"
300,15,418,"And Polymelus, by his sire surnam’d Argeadas,"
300,15,419,"He heap’d upon the much - fed earth. When Jove’s most worthy son,"
300,15,420,"Divine Sarpedon, saw these friends thus stay’d, and others run,"
300,15,421,"“O shame! Why fly ye?” then he cried, “Now show ye feet enow."
300,15,422,"On, keep your way, myself will meet the man that startles you,"
300,15,423,"To make me understand his name that flaunts in conquest thus,"
300,15,424,And hath so many able knees so soon dissolv’d to us.”
300,15,425,Down jump’d he from his chariot; down leap’d his foe as light.
300,15,426,"And as, on some far - looking rock, a cast of vultures fight,"
300,15,427,"Fly on each other, strike and truss, part, meet, and then stick by,"
300,15,428,"Tug both with crooked beaks and seres, cry, fight, and fight and cry;"
300,15,429,"So fiercely fought these angry kings, and show’d as bitter galls."
300,15,430,"Jove, turning eyes to this stern fight, his wife and sister calls,"
300,15,431,"And much mov’d for the Lycian Prince, said: “O that to my son"
300,15,432,"Fate, by this day and man, should cut a thread so nobly spun!"
300,15,433,"Two minds distract me; if I should now ravish him from fight,"
300,15,434,And set him safe in Lycia; or give the Fates their right.”
300,15,435,"“Austere Saturnius,” she replied, “what unjust words are these?"
300,15,436,"A mortal, long since mark’d by fate, wouldst thou immortalize?"
300,15,437,"Do, but by no God be approv’d. Free him, and numbers more,"
300,15,438,"Sons of Immortals, will live free, that death must taste before"
300,15,439,"These gates of Ilion; ev’ry God will have his son a God,"
300,15,440,Or storm extremely. Give him then an honest period
300,15,441,"In brave fight by Patroclus’ sword, if he be dear to thee,"
300,15,442,"And grieves thee for his danger’d life; of which when he is free,"
300,15,443,"Let Death and Somnus bear him hence, till Lycia’s natural womb"
300,15,444,"Receive him from his brother’s hands, and citizens’; a tomb"
300,15,445,And column rais’d to him. This is the honour of the dead.”
300,15,446,"She said, and her speech rul’d his pow’r; but in his safety’s stead,"
300,15,447,"For sad ostent of his near death, he steep’d his living name"
300,15,448,"In drops of blood heav’n swet for him, which earth drunk to his fame."
300,15,449,"And now, as this high combat grew to this too humble end,"
300,15,450,Sarpedon’s death had this state more; ’twas usher’d by his friend
300,15,451,"And charioteer, brave Thrasymed; whom in his belly’s rim"
300,15,452,"Patroclus wounded with his lance, and endless ended him."
300,15,453,And then another act of name foreran his princely fate.
300,15,454,"His first lance missing, he let fly a second that gave date"
300,15,455,"Of violent death to Pedasus; who, as he joy’d to die"
300,15,456,"By his so honourable hand, did ev’n in dying neigh."
300,15,457,"His ruin startled th’ other steeds, the gears crack’d, and the reins"
300,15,458,Strappled his fellows; whose misrule Automedon restrains
300,15,459,"By cutting the intangling gears, and so dissund’ring quite"
300,15,460,"The brave slain beast; when both the rest obey’d, and went foreright."
300,15,461,And then the royal combatants fought for the final stroke;
300,15,462,"When Lycia’s Gen’ral miss’d again, his high - rais’d jav’lin took"
300,15,463,Above his shoulder empty way. But no such speedless flight
300,15,464,"Patroclus let his spear perform, that on the breast did light"
300,15,465,"Of his brave foe, where life’s strings close about the solid heart,"
300,15,466,"Impressing a recureless wound; his knees then left their part,"
300,15,467,"And let him fall; when like an oak, a poplar, or a pine,"
300,15,468,"New fell’d by arts - men on the hills, he stretch’d his form divine"
300,15,469,Before his horse and chariot. And as a lion leaps
300,15,470,"Upon a goodly yellow bull, drives all the herd in heaps,"
300,15,471,"And, under his unconquer’d jaws, the brave beast sighing dies;"
300,15,472,"So sigh’d Sarpedon underneath this prince of enemies,"
300,15,473,"Call’d Glaucus to him, his dear friend, and said: “Now, friend, thy"
300,15,474,hands
300,15,475,Much duty owe to fight and arms; now for my love it stands
300,15,476,Thy heart in much hand to approve that war is harmful; now
300,15,477,"How active all thy forces are, this one hour’s act must show."
300,15,478,"First call our Lycian captains up, look round, and bring up all,"
300,15,479,"And all exhort to stand, like friends, about Sarpedon’s fall,"
300,15,480,And spend thyself thy steel for me; for be assur’d no day
300,15,481,"Of all thy life, to thy last hour, can clear thy black dismay"
300,15,482,"In woe and infamy for me, if I be taken hence"
300,15,483,"Spoil’d of mine arms, and thy renown despoil’d of my defence."
300,15,484,"Stand firm then, and confirm thy men.” This said, the bounds of death"
300,15,485,"Concluded all sight to his eyes, and to his nosthrils breath."
300,15,486,"Patroclus, though his guard was strong, forc’d way through ev’ry doubt,"
300,15,487,"Climb’d his high bosom with his foot, and pluck’d his jav’lin out,"
300,15,488,And with it drew the film and strings of his yet panting heart;
300,15,489,"And last, together with the pile, his princely soul did part."
300,15,490,"His horse, spoil’d both of guide and king, thick snoring and amaz’d,"
300,15,491,"And apt to flight, the Myrmidons made nimbly to, and seiz’d."
300,15,492,"Glaucus, to hear his friend ask aid, of him past all the rest,"
300,15,493,"Though well he knew his wound uncur’d, confusion fill’d his breast"
300,15,494,"Not to have good in any pow’r, and yet so much good will."
300,15,495,"And (laying his hand upon his wound, that pain’d him sharply still,"
300,15,496,"And was by Teucer’s hand set on from their assail’d steep wall,"
300,15,497,"In keeping hurt from other men) he did on Phœbus call,"
300,15,498,"The God of med’cines, for his cure: “Thou King of cures,” said he,"
300,15,499,"“That art perhaps in Lycia with her rich progeny,"
300,15,500,"Or here in Troy; but any where, since thou hast pow’r to hear,"
300,15,501,"O give a hurt and woeful man, as I am now, thine ear."
300,15,502,"This arm sustains a cruel wound, whose pains shoot ev’ry way,"
300,15,503,"Afflict this shoulder, and this hand, and nothing long can stay"
300,15,504,A flux of blood still issuing; nor therefore can I stand
300,15,505,"With any enemy in fight, nor hardly make my hand"
300,15,506,"Support my lance; and here lies dead the worthiest of men,"
300,15,507,"Sarpedon, worthy son to Jove, whose pow’r could yet abstain"
300,15,508,"From all aid in this deadly need; give thou then aid to me,"
300,15,509,O King of all aid to men hurt; assuage th’ extremity
300,15,510,"Of this arm’s anguish, give it strength, that by my precedent"
300,15,511,"I may excite my men to blows, and this dead corse prevent"
300,15,512,"Of further violence.” He pray’d, and kind Apollo heard,"
300,15,513,"Allay’d his anguish, and his wound of all the black blood clear’d"
300,15,514,"That vex’d it so, infus’d fresh pow’rs into his weaken’d mind;"
300,15,515,"And all his spirits flow’d with joy that Phœbus stood inclin’d,"
300,15,516,"In such quick bounty, to his pray’rs. Then, as Sarpedon will’d,"
300,15,517,He cast about his greedy eye; and first of all instill’d
300,15,518,"To all his captains all the stings, that could inflame their fight"
300,15,519,"For good Sarpedon. And from them, he stretch’d his speedy pace"
300,15,520,"T’ Agenor, Hector, Venus’ son, and wise Polydamas;"
300,15,521,"And (only naming Hector) said: “Hector, you now forget"
300,15,522,"Your poor auxiliary friends, that in your toils have swet"
300,15,523,"Their friendless souls out far from home. Sarpedon, that sustain’d"
300,15,524,"With justice, and his virtues all, broad Lycia, hath not gain’d"
300,15,525,The like guard for his person here; for yonder dead he lies
300,15,526,"Beneath the great Patroclus’ lance. But come, let your supplies,"
300,15,527,"Good friends, stand near him. O disdain to see his corse defil’d"
300,15,528,"With Grecian fury; and his arms, by their oppressions spoil’d."
300,15,529,"These Myrmidons are come enrag’d, that such a mighty boot"
300,15,530,"Of Greeks Troy’s darts have made at fleet.” This said, from head to"
300,15,531,foot
300,15,532,"Grief strook their pow’rs past patience, and not to be restrain’d,"
300,15,533,"To hear news of Sarpedon’s death; who, though he appertain’d"
300,15,534,"To other cities, yet to theirs he was the very fort,"
300,15,535,"And led a mighty people there, of all whose better sort"
300,15,536,Himself was best. This made them run in flames upon the foe;
300,15,537,"The first man Hector, to whose heart Sarpedon’s death did go."
300,15,538,"Patroclus stirr’d the Grecian spirits; and first th’ Ajaces, thus:"
300,15,539,"“Now, brothers, be it dear to you, to fight and succour us,"
300,15,540,"As ever heretofore ye did, with men first excellent."
300,15,541,"The man lies slain that first did scale, and raze the battlement"
300,15,542,"That crown’d our wall, the Lycian prince. But if we now shall add"
300,15,543,"Force to his corse, and spoil his arms, a prise may more be had"
300,15,544,"Of many great ones, that for him will put on to the death.”"
300,15,545,To this work these were prompt enough; and each side ordereth
300,15,546,Those phalanxes that most had rate of resolutions;
300,15,547,The Trojans and the Lycian pow’rs; the Greeks and Myrmidons.
300,15,548,"These ran together for the corse, and clos’d with horrid cries,"
300,15,549,Their armours thund’ring with the claps laid on about the prise.
300,15,550,"And Jove, about th’ impetuous broil, pernicious night pour’d out,"
300,15,551,"As long as for his lovéd son, pernicious Labour fought."
300,15,552,"The first of Troy the first Greeks foil’d; when, not the last indeed"
300,15,553,"Amongst the Myrmidons, was slain, the great Agacleus’ seed,"
300,15,554,"Divine Epigeus, that before had exercis’d command"
300,15,555,In fair Budeiüs; but because he laid a bloody hand
300,15,556,"On his own sister’s valiant son, to Peleus and his queen"
300,15,557,"He came for pardon, and obtain’d; his slaughter being the mean"
300,15,558,"He came to Troy, and so to this. He ventur’d ev’n to touch"
300,15,559,"The princely carcass; when a stone did more to him by much,"
300,15,560,"Sent out of able Hector’s hand; it cut his skull in twain,"
300,15,561,"And strook him dead. Patroclus, griev’d to see his friend so slain,"
300,15,562,Before the foremost thrust himself. And as a falcon frays
300,15,563,A flock of stares or caddesses; such fear brought his assays
300,15,564,"Amongst the Trojans and their friends; and, angry at the heart,"
300,15,565,"As well as griev’d, for him so slain, another stony dart"
300,15,566,"As good as Hector’s he let fly, that dusted in the neck"
300,15,567,"Of Sthenelaus, thrust his head to earth first, and did break"
300,15,568,"The nerves in sunder with his fall; off fell the Trojans too,"
300,15,569,"Ev’n Hector’s self, and all as far as any man can throw"
300,15,570,"(Provok’d for games, or in the wars to shed an enemy’s soul)"
300,15,571,"A light long dart. The first that turn’d, was he that did control"
300,15,572,"The targeteers of Lycia, prince Glaucus; who to hell"
300,15,573,"Sent Bathyclæus, Chalcon’s son; he did in Hellas dwell,"
300,15,574,And shin’d for wealth and happiness amongst the Myrmidons;
300,15,575,"His bosom’s midst the jav’lin strook, his fall gat earth with groans."
300,15,576,"The Greeks griev’d, and the Trojans joy’d, for so renown’d a man;"
300,15,577,About whom stood the Grecians firm. And then the death began
300,15,578,"On Troy’s side by Meriones; he slew one great in war,"
300,15,579,"Laogonus, Onetor’s son, the priest of Jupiter,"
300,15,580,Created in th’ Idæan hill. Betwixt his jaw and ear
300,15,581,"The dart stuck fast, and loos’d his soul; sad mists of hate and fear"
300,15,582,Invading him. Anchises’ son despatch’d a brazen lance
300,15,583,At bold Meriones; and hop’d to make an equal chance
300,15,584,"On him with bold Laogonus, though under his broad shield"
300,15,585,"He lay so close. But he discern’d, and made his body yield"
300,15,586,"So low, that over him it flew, and trembling took the ground,"
300,15,587,With which Mars made it quench his thirst; and since the head could
300,15,588,wound
300,15,589,"No better body, and yet thrown from ne’er the worse a hand,"
300,15,590,"It turn’d from earth, and look’d awry. Æneas let it stand,"
300,15,591,"Much angry at the vain event, and told Meriones"
300,15,592,"He scap’d but hardly, nor had cause to hope for such success"
300,15,593,"Another time, though well he knew his dancing faculty,"
300,15,594,"By whose agility he scap’d; for, had his dart gone by"
300,15,595,"With any least touch, instantly he had been ever slain."
300,15,596,"He answer’d: “Though thy strength be good, it cannot render vain"
300,15,597,"The strength of others with thy jests; nor art thou so divine,"
300,15,598,"But when my lance shall touch at thee, with equal speed to thine,"
300,15,599,Death will share with it thy life’s pow’rs; thy confidence can shun
300,15,600,No more than mine what his right claims.” Menœtius’ noble son
300,15,601,"Rebuk’d Meriones, and said: “What need’st thou use this speech?"
300,15,602,"Nor thy strength is approv’d with words, good friend, nor can we reach"
300,15,603,"The body, nor make th’ enemy yield, with these our counterbraves."
300,15,604,"We must enforce the binding earth, to hold them in her graves."
300,15,605,"If you will war, fight. Will you speak? Give counsel Counsel, blows,"
300,15,606,"Are th’ ends of wars and words. Talk here, the time in vain bestows.”"
300,15,607,"He said, and led; and, nothing less for any thing he said,"
300,15,608,(His speech being season’d with such right) the worthy seconded.
300,15,609,"And then, as in a sounding vale, near neighbour to a hill,"
300,15,610,"Wood - fellers make a far - heard noise, with chopping, chopping still,"
300,15,611,"And laying on, on blocks and trees; so they on men laid load,"
300,15,612,"And beat like noises into air, both as they strook and trode."
300,15,613,"But, past their noise, so full of blood, of dust, of darts, lay smit"
300,15,614,"Divine Sarpedon, that a man must have an excellent wit"
300,15,615,"That could but know him, and might fail, so from his utmost head,"
300,15,616,"Ev’n to the low plants of his feet, his form was alteréd."
300,15,617,"All thrusting near it ev’ry way, as thick as flies in spring,"
300,15,618,"That in a sheep - cote, when new milk assembles them, make wing,"
300,15,619,And buzz about the top - full pails. Nor ever was the eye
300,15,620,"Of Jove averted from the fight; he view’d, thought, ceaselessly"
300,15,621,"And diversly upon the death of great Achilles’ friend,"
300,15,622,"If Hector there, to wreak his son, should with his jav’lin end"
300,15,623,"His life, and force away his arms, or still augment the field;"
300,15,624,He then concluded that the flight of much more soul should yield
300,15,625,"Achilles’ good friend more renown, and that ev’n to their gates"
300,15,626,He should drive Hector and his host; and so disanimates
300,15,627,"The mind of Hector that he mounts his chariot, and takes Flight"
300,15,628,"Up with him, tempting all to her; affirming his insight"
300,15,629,Knew evidently that the beam of Jove’s all - ord’ring scoles
300,15,630,"Was then in sinking on their side, surcharg’d with flocks of souls."
300,15,631,"Then not the noble Lycians stay’d, but left their slaughter’d lord"
300,15,632,Amongst the corses’ common heap; for many more were pour’d
300,15,633,"About and on him, while Jove’s hand held out the bitter broil."
300,15,634,"And now they spoil’d Sarpedon’s arms, and to the ships the spoil"
300,15,635,Was sent by Menœtiades. Then Jove thus charg’d the Sun:
300,15,636,"“Haste, honour’d Phœbus, let no more Greek violence be done"
300,15,637,To my Sarpedon; but his corse of all the sable blood
300,15,638,"And jav’lins purg’d; then carry him, far hence to some clear flood,"
300,15,639,"With whose waves wash, and then embalm each thorough - cleanséd limb"
300,15,640,"With our ambrosia; which perform’d, divine weeds put on him,"
300,15,641,"And then to those swift mates and twins, sweet Sleep and Death, commit"
300,15,642,"His princely person, that with speed they both may carry it"
300,15,643,"To wealthy Lycia; where his friends and brothers will embrace,"
300,15,644,"And tomb it in some monument, as fits a prince’s place.”"
300,15,645,"Then flew Apollo to the fight, from the Idalian hill,"
300,15,646,At all parts putting into act his great Commander’s will;
300,15,647,"Drew all the darts, wash’d, balm’d the corse; which, deck’d with"
300,15,648,"ornament,"
300,15,649,"By Sleep and Death, those feather’d twins, he into Lycia sent."
300,15,650,Patroclus then Automedon commands to give his steeds
300,15,651,"Large reins, and all way to the chace; so madly he exceeds"
300,15,652,The strict commission of his friend; which had he kept had kept
300,15,653,A black death from him. But Jove’s mind hath evermore outstept
300,15,654,"The mind of man; who both affrights, and takes the victory"
300,15,655,"From any hardiest hand with ease; which he can justify,"
300,15,656,"Though he himself commands him fight, as now he put this chace"
300,15,657,"In Menœtiades’s mind. How much then weighs the grace,"
300,15,658,"Patroclus, that Jove gives thee now, in scoles put with thy death,"
300,15,659,Of all these great and famous men the honourable breath!
300,15,660,"Of which Adrestus first he slew, and next Autonous,"
300,15,661,"Epistora, and Perimus, Pylartes, Elasus,"
300,15,662,"Swift Menalippus, Molius; all these were overthrown"
300,15,663,"By him, and all else put in rout; and then proud Ilion"
300,15,664,"Had stoop’d beneath his glorious hand, he rag’d so with his lance,"
300,15,665,"If Phœbus had not kept the tow’r, and help’d the Ilians,"
300,15,666,Sustaining ill thoughts ’gainst the prince. Thrice to the prominence
300,15,667,Of Troy’s steep wall he bravely leap’d; thrice Phœbus thrust him
300,15,668,"thence,"
300,15,669,"Objecting his all - dazzling shield, with his resistless hand;"
300,15,670,"But fourthly, when, like one of heav’n, he would have stirr’d his"
300,15,671,"stand,"
300,15,672,"Apollo threaten’d him, and said: “Cease, it exceeds thy fate,"
300,15,673,"Forward, Patroclus, to expugn with thy bold lance this state;"
300,15,674,"Nor under great Achilles’ pow’rs, to thine superior far,"
300,15,675,"Lies Troy’s grave ruin.” When he spake, Patroclus left that war,"
300,15,676,"Leap’d far back, and his anger shunn’d. Hector detain’d his horse"
300,15,677,"Within the Scæan port, in doubt to put his personal force"
300,15,678,"Amongst the rout, and turn their heads, or shun in Troy the storm."
300,15,679,"Apollo, seeing his suspense, resum’d the goodly form"
300,15,680,"Of Hector’s uncle, Asius; the Phrygian Dymas’ son,"
300,15,681,"Who near the deep Sangarius had habitation,"
300,15,682,"Being brother to the Trojan queen. His shape Apollo took,"
300,15,683,"And ask’d of Hector, why his spirit so clear the fight forsook?"
300,15,684,"Affirming ’twas unfit for him, and wish’d his forces were"
300,15,685,"As much above his, as they mov’d in an inferior sphere."
300,15,686,"He should, with shame to him, be gone; and so bade drive away"
300,15,687,"Against Patroclus, to approve, if He that gave them day"
300,15,688,Would give the glory of his death to his preferréd lance.
300,15,689,"So left he him, and to the fight did his bright head advance,"
300,15,690,"Mix’d with the multitude, and stirr’d foul tumult for the foe."
300,15,691,Then Hector bade Cebriones put on; himself let go
300,15,692,"All other Greeks within his reach, and only gave command"
300,15,693,To front Patroclus. He at him; jump’d down; his strong left hand
300,15,694,"A jav’lin held, his right a stone, a marble sharp and such"
300,15,695,"As his large hand had pow’r to gripe, and gave it strength as much"
300,15,696,"As he could lie to; nor stood long, in fear of that huge man"
300,15,697,"That made against him, but full on with his huge stone he ran,"
300,15,698,"Discharg’d, and drave it ’twixt the brows of bold Cebriones."
300,15,699,"Nor could the thick bone there prepar’d extenuate so th’ access,"
300,15,700,"But out it drave his broken eyes, which in the dust fell down,"
300,15,701,And he div’d after; which conceit of diving took the son
300,15,702,"Of old Menœtius, who thus play’d upon the other’s bane."
300,15,703,"“O heav’ns! For truth, this Trojan was a passing active man!"
300,15,704,"With what exceeding ease he dives, as if at work he were"
300,15,705,Within the fishy seas! This man alone would furnish cheer
300,15,706,"For twenty men, though ’twere a storm, to leap out of a sail,"
300,15,707,"And gather oysters for them all, he does it here as well,"
300,15,708,And there are many such in Troy.” Thus jested he so near
300,15,709,"His own grave death; and then made in, to spoil the charioteer,"
300,15,710,"With such a lion’s force and fate, as, often ruining"
300,15,711,"Stalls of fat oxen, gets at length a mortal wound to sting"
300,15,712,"His soul out of that rav’nous breast, that was so insolent,"
300,15,713,And so his life’s bliss proves his bane; so deadly confident
300,15,714,"Wert thou, Patroclus, in pursuit of good Cebriones,"
300,15,715,"To whose defence now Hector leap’d. The opposite address,"
300,15,716,"These masters of the cry in war now made, was of the kind"
300,15,717,"Of two fierce kings of beasts, oppos’d in strife about a hind"
300,15,718,"Slain on the forehead of a hill, both sharp and hungry set"
300,15,719,And to the currie never came but like two deaths they met;
300,15,720,Nor these two entertain’d less mind of mutual prejudice
300,15,721,"About the body, close to which when each had press’d for prise,"
300,15,722,"Hector the head laid hand upon, which, once grip’d, never could"
300,15,723,"Be forc’d from him; Patroclus then upon the feet got hold,"
300,15,724,"And he pinch’d with as sure a nail. So both stood tugging there,"
300,15,725,"While all the rest made eager fight, and grappled ev’ry where."
300,15,726,"And as the east and south winds strive, to make a lofty wood"
300,15,727,"Bow to their greatness, barky elms, wild ashes, beeches, bow’d"
300,15,728,"Ev’n with the earth, in whose thick arms the mighty vapours lie,"
300,15,729,"And toss by turns, all, either way, their leaves at random fly,"
300,15,730,"Boughs murmur, and their bodies crack, and with perpetual din"
300,15,731,"The sylvans falter, and the storms are never to begin;"
300,15,732,"So rag’d the fight, and all from Flight pluck’d her forgotten wings,"
300,15,733,"While some still stuck, still new - wing’d shafts flew dancing from their"
300,15,734,"strings,"
300,15,735,"Huge stones sent after that did shake the shields about the corse,"
300,15,736,"Who now, in dust’s soft forehead stretch’d, forgat his guiding horse."
300,15,737,"As long as Phœbus turn’d his wheels about the midst of heaven,"
300,15,738,So long the touch of either’s darts the falls of both made even;
300,15,739,"But, when his wain drew near the west, the Greeks past measure were"
300,15,740,"The abler soldiers, and so swept the Trojan tumult clear"
300,15,741,"From off the body, out of which they drew the hurl’d - in darts,"
300,15,742,And from his shoulders stripp’d his arms; and then to more such parts
300,15,743,"Patroclus turn’d his striving thoughts, to do the Trojans ill."
300,15,744,"Thrice, like the God of war, he charg’d, his voice as horrible,"
300,15,745,"And thrice - nine those three charges slew; but in the fourth assay,"
300,15,746,"O then, Patroclus, show’d thy last; the dreadful Sun made way"
300,15,747,"Against that onset; yet the prince discern’d no Deity,"
300,15,748,"He kept the press so, and, besides, obscur’d his glorious eye"
300,15,749,"With such felt darkness. At his back, he made a sudden stand,"
300,15,750,And ’twixt his neck and shoulders laid down - right with either hand
300,15,751,"A blow so weighty, that his eyes a giddy darkness took,"
300,15,752,"And from his head his three - plum’d helm the bounding violence shook,"
300,15,753,"That rung beneath his horses’ hooves, and, like a water - spout,"
300,15,754,"Was crush’d together with the fall; the plumes that set it out,"
300,15,755,All spatter’d with black blood and dust; when ever heretofore
300,15,756,It was a capital offence to have or dust or gore
300,15,757,"Defile a triple - feather’d helm, but on the head divine"
300,15,758,"And youthful temples of their prince it us’d, untouch’d, to shine."
300,15,759,"Yet now Jove gave it Hector’s hands, the other’s death was near."
300,15,760,"Besides whose lost and filéd helm his huge long weighty spear,"
300,15,761,"Well - bound with iron, in his hand was shiver’d, and his shield"
300,15,762,"Fell from his shoulders to his feet, the bawdrick strewing the field;"
300,15,763,"His curets left him, like the rest. And all this only done"
300,15,764,"By great Apollo. Then his mind took in confusion,"
300,15,765,"The vig’rous knittings of his joints dissolv’d; and, thus dismay’d,"
300,15,766,"A Dardan, one of Panthus’ sons, and one that overlaid"
300,15,767,"All Trojans of his place with darts, swift footing, skill, and force"
300,15,768,"In noble horsemanship, and one that tumbled from their horse,"
300,15,769,"One after other, twenty men, and when he did but learn"
300,15,770,The art of war; nay when he first did in the field discern
300,15,771,"A horse and chariot of his guide; this man, with all these parts,"
300,15,772,"(His name Euphorbus) comes behind, and ’twixt the shoulders darts"
300,15,773,"Forlorn Patroclus, who yet liv’d, and th’ other (getting forth"
300,15,774,His jav’lin) took him to his strength; nor durst he stand the worth
300,15,775,"Of thee, Patroclus, though disarm’d, who yet (discomfited"
300,15,776,By Phœbus’ and Euphorbus’ wound) the red heap of the dead
300,15,777,"He now too late shunn’d, and retir’d. When Hector saw him yield,"
300,15,778,"And knew he yielded with a wound, he scour’d the arméd field,"
300,15,779,"Came close up to him, and both sides strook quite through with his"
300,15,780,lance.
300,15,781,"He fell, and his most weighty fall gave fit tune to his chance;"
300,15,782,For which all Greece extremely mourn’d. And as a mighty strife
300,15,783,"About a little fount begins, and riseth to the life"
300,15,784,Of some fell boar resolv’d to drink; when likewise to the spring
300,15,785,"A lion comes alike dispos’d, the boar thirsts, and his king,"
300,15,786,"Both proud, and both will first be serv’d; and then the lion takes"
300,15,787,"Advantage of his sov’reign strength, and th’ other, fainting, makes"
300,15,788,"Resign his thirst up with his blood; Patroclus, so enforc’d"
300,15,789,"When he had forc’d so much brave life, was from his own divorc’d."
300,15,790,"And thus his great divorcer brav’d: “Patroclus, thy conceit"
300,15,791,"Gave thee th’ eversion of our Troy, and to thy fleet a freight"
300,15,792,"Of Trojan ladies, their free lives put all in bands by thee;"
300,15,793,"But (too much prizer of thy self) all these are propp’d by me,"
300,15,794,"For these have my horse stretch’d their hoofs to this so long a war,"
300,15,795,"And I (far best of Troy in arms) keep off from Troy as far,"
300,15,796,"Ev’n to the last beam of my life, their necessary day."
300,15,797,"And here, in place of us and ours, on thee shall vultures prey,"
300,15,798,"Poor wretch; nor shall thy mighty friend afford thee any aid,"
300,15,799,"That gave thy parting much deep charge, and this perhaps be said:"
300,15,800,"‘Martial Patroclus, turn not face, nor see my fleet before"
300,15,801,"The curets from great Hector’s breast, all gilded with his gore,"
300,15,802,"Thou hew’st in pieces.’ If thus vain were his far - stretched commands,"
300,15,803,As vain was thy heart to believe his words lay in thy hands.”
300,15,804,"He, languishing, replied: “This proves, thy glory worse than vain,"
300,15,805,"That when two Gods have giv’n thy hands what their pow’rs did obtain,"
300,15,806,"(They conqu’ring, and they spoiling me both of my arms and mind,"
300,15,807,It being a work of ease for them) thy soul should be so blind
300,15,808,"To oversee their evident deeds, and take their pow’rs to thee;"
300,15,809,"When, if the pow’rs of twenty such had dar’d t’ encounter me,"
300,15,810,My lance had strew’d earth with them all. Thou only dost obtain
300,15,811,"A third place in my death; whom, first, a harmful hate hath slain"
300,15,812,"Effected by Latona’s son; second, and first of men,"
300,15,813,Euphorbus. And this one thing more concerns thee; note it then;
300,15,814,"Thou shalt not long survive thyself; nay, now death calls for thee,"
300,15,815,And violent fate; Achilles’ lance shall make this good for me.”
300,15,816,"Thus death join’d to his words his end; his soul took instant wing,"
300,15,817,And to the house that hath no lights descended) sorrowing
300,15,818,"For his sad fate, to leave him young, and in his ablest age."
300,15,819,"He dead, yet Hector ask’d him why, in that prophetic rage,"
300,15,820,"He so forespake him, when none knew but great Achilles might"
300,15,821,"Prevent his death, and on his lance receive his latest light?"
300,15,822,"Thus setting on his side his foot, he drew out of his wound"
300,15,823,"His brazen lance, and upwards cast the body on the ground;"
300,15,824,"When quickly, while the dart was hot, he charg’d Automedon,"
300,15,825,"Divine guide of Achilles’ steeds, in great contention"
300,15,826,"To seize him too; but his so swift and deathless horse, that fetch’d"
300,15,827,"Their gift to Peleus from the Gods, soon rapt him from his reach."
300,15,828,THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH BOOK.
300,15,829,"[1] Jupiter called the God of sounds, for the chief sound his thunder."
300,15,830,[2] A simile most lively expressive.
300,16,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,16,2,A dreadful fight about Patroclus’ corse;
300,16,3,Euphorbus slain by Menelaus’ force;
300,16,4,Hector in th’ armour of Æacides;
300,16,5,Antilochus relating the decease
300,16,6,Of slain Patroclus to fair Thetis’ son;
300,16,7,The body from the striving Trojans won;
300,16,8,Th’ Ajaces making good the after field;
300,16,9,"Make all the subject that this book doth yield,"
300,16,10,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,16,11,In Rho the vent’rous hosts maintain
300,16,12,A slaught’rous conflict for the slain.
300,16,13,Nor could his slaughter rest conceal’d from Menelaus’ ear;
300,16,14,"Who flew amongst the foremost fights, and with his targe and spear"
300,16,15,"Circled the body, as much griev’d, and with as tender heed"
300,16,16,"To keep it theirs, as any dam about her first - born seed,"
300,16,17,"Not proving what the pain of birth would make the love before,"
300,16,18,Nor to pursue his first attaint Euphorbus’ spirit forbore;[1]
300,16,19,"But, seeing Menelaus chief in rescue of the dead,"
300,16,20,"Assay’d him thus: “Atrides, cease, and leave the slaughteréd"
300,16,21,"With his embru’d spoil to the man, that first, of all our state,"
300,16,22,"And famous succours, in fair fight, made passage to his fate;"
300,16,23,And therefore suffer me to wear the good name I have won
300,16,24,"Amongst the Trojans, lest thy life repay what his hath done.”"
300,16,25,"“O Jupiter,” said he, incens’d, “thou art no honest man"
300,16,26,"To boast so past thy pow’r to do. Not any lion can,"
300,16,27,"Nor spotted leopard, nor boar, whose mind is mightiest"
300,16,28,"In pouring fury from his strength, advance so proud a crest"
300,16,29,"As Panthus’ fighting progeny. But Hyperenor’s pride,"
300,16,30,"That joy’d so little time his youth, when he so vilified"
300,16,31,"My force in arms, and call’d me worst of all our chivalry,"
300,16,32,"And stood my worst, might teach ye all to shun this surcuidrie;"
300,16,33,"I think he came not safely home, to tell his wife his acts."
300,16,34,"Nor less right of thy insolence my equal fate exacts,"
300,16,35,"And will obtain me, if thou stay’st. Retire then, take advice:"
300,16,36,"A fool sees nought before ’tis done, and still too late is wise.”"
300,16,37,"This mov’d not him but to the worse, since it renew’d the sting"
300,16,38,"That his slain brother shot in him, remember’d by the king,"
300,16,39,"To whom he answer’d: “Thou shalt pay, for all the pains endur’d"
300,16,40,"By that slain brother, all the wounds sustain’d for him, recur’d"
300,16,41,With one made in thy heart by me. ’Tis true thou mad’st his wife
300,16,42,"A heavy widow, when her joys of wedlock scarce had life,"
300,16,43,"And hurt’st our parents with his grief; all which thou gloriest in,"
300,16,44,"Forespeaking so thy death, that now their grief’s end shall begin."
300,16,45,"To Panthus, and the snowy hand of Phrontes, I will bring"
300,16,46,"Those arms, and that proud head of thine. And this laborious thing"
300,16,47,"Shall ask no long time to perform. Nor be my words alone,"
300,16,48,"But their performance; Strength, and Fight, and Terror thus sets on.”"
300,16,49,"This said, he strook his all - round shield; nor shrunk that, but his"
300,16,50,lance
300,16,51,That turn’d head in it. Then the king assay’d the second chance;
300,16,52,First praying to the King of Gods; and his dart entry got
300,16,53,"(The force much driving back his foe) in low part of his throat,"
300,16,54,"And ran his neck through. Then fell pride, and he; and all with gore"
300,16,55,"His locks, that like the Graces were, and which he ever wore"
300,16,56,"In gold and silver ribands wrapp’d, were piteously wet."
300,16,57,"And when alone in some choice place, a husbandman hath set"
300,16,58,"The young plant of an olive tree, whose root being ever fed"
300,16,59,"With plenty of delicious springs, his branches bravely spread,"
300,16,60,"And all his fresh and lovely head, grown curl’d with snowy flow’rs,"
300,16,61,"That dance and flourish with the winds, that are of gentlest pow’rs;"
300,16,62,"But when a whirlwind, got aloft, stoops with a sudden gale,"
300,16,63,"Tears from his head his tender curls, and tosseth therewithal"
300,16,64,His fix’d root from his hollow mines; it well presents the force
300,16,65,"Of Sparta’s king; and so the plant, Euphorbus and his corse."
300,16,66,"He slain, the king stripp’d off his arms; and with their worthy prise,"
300,16,67,"All fearing him, had clearly pass’d, if heaven’s fair Eye of eyes"
300,16,68,"Had not, in envy of his acts, to his encounter stirr’d"
300,16,69,The Mars - like Hector; to whose pow’rs the rescue he preferr’d
300,16,70,"Of those fair arms, and took the shape of Mentas, colonel"
300,16,71,Of all the Cicones that near the Thracian Hebrus dwell.
300,16,72,"Like him, he thus puts forth his voice: “Hector, thou scour’st the"
300,16,73,field
300,16,74,"In headstrong púrsuit of those horse, that hardly are compell’d"
300,16,75,"To take the draught of chariots, by any mortal’s hand;"
300,16,76,"The great grandchild of Æacus hath only their command,"
300,16,77,"Whom an immortal mother bore. While thou attend’st on these,"
300,16,78,"The young Atrides, in defence of Menœtiades,"
300,16,79,Hath slain Euphorbus.” Thus the God took troop with men again;
300,16,80,"And Hector, heartily perplex’d, look’d round, and saw the slain"
300,16,81,Still shedding rivers from his wound; and then took envious view
300,16,82,Of brave Atrides with his spoil; in way to whom he flew
300,16,83,Like one of Vulcan’s quenchless flames. Atrides heard the cry
300,16,84,"That ever usher’d him, and sigh’d, and said: “O me, if I[2]"
300,16,85,"Should leave these goodly arms, and him, that here lies dead for me,"
300,16,86,I fear I should offend the Greeks; if I should stay and be
300,16,87,"Alone with Hector and his men, I may be compass’d in,"
300,16,88,"Some sleight or other they may use, many may quickly win"
300,16,89,"Their wills of one, and all Troy comes ever where Hector leads."
300,16,90,"But why, dear mind, dost thou thus talk? When men dare set their heads"
300,16,91,"Against the Gods, as sure they do that fight with men they love,"
300,16,92,Straight one or other plague ensues. It cannot therefore move
300,16,93,"The grudge of any Greek that sees I yield to Hector, he"
300,16,94,Still fighting with a spirit from heav’n. And yet if I could see
300,16,95,"Brave Ajax, he and I would stand, though ’gainst a God; and sure"
300,16,96,"’Tis best I seek him, and then see if we two can procure"
300,16,97,This corse’s freedom through all these. A little then let rest
300,16,98,"The body, and my mind be still. Of two bads choose the best.”"
300,16,99,"In this discourse, the troops of Troy were in with him, and he"
300,16,100,"Made such a lion - like retreat, as when the herdsmen see"
300,16,101,"The royal savage, and come on, with men, dogs, cries, and spears,"
300,16,102,"To clear their hornéd stall, and then the kingly heart he bears"
300,16,103,(With all his high disdain) falls off; so from this odds of aid
300,16,104,"The golden - hair’d Atrides fled, and in his strength display’d"
300,16,105,"Upon his left hand him he wish’d, extremely busiéd"
300,16,106,"About encouraging his men, to whom an extreme dread"
300,16,107,"Apollo had infus’d. The king reach’d Ajax instantly,"
300,16,108,"And said: “Come, friend, let us two haste, and from the tyranny"
300,16,109,Of Hector free Patroclus’ corse.” He straight and gladly went;
300,16,110,"And then was Hector haling off the body, with intent"
300,16,111,"To spoil the shoulders of the dead, and give the dogs the rest,"
300,16,112,His arms he having pris’d before; when Ajax brought his breast
300,16,113,"To bar all further spoil. With that he had, sure Hector thought"
300,16,114,‘Twas best to satisfy his spleen; which temper Ajax wrought
300,16,115,"With his mere sight, and Hector fled. The arms he sent to Troy,"
300,16,116,"To make his citizens admire, and pray Jove send him joy."
300,16,117,"Then Ajax gather’d to the corse, and hid it with his targe,"
300,16,118,"There setting down as sure a foot, as, in the tender charge"
300,16,119,"Of his lov’d whelps, a lion doth; two hundred hunters near"
300,16,120,"To give him onset, their more force makes him the more austere,"
300,16,121,"Drowns all their clamours in his roars, darts, dogs, doth all despise,"
300,16,122,"And lets his rough brows down so low, they cover all his eyes;"
300,16,123,"So Ajax look’d, and stood, and stay’d for great Priamides."
300,16,124,When Glaucus Hippolochides saw Ajax thus depress
300,16,125,"The spirit of Hector, thus he chid: “O goodly man at arms,"
300,16,126,"In fight a Paris, why should fame make thee fort ’gainst our harms,"
300,16,127,"Being such a fugitive? Now mark, how well thy boasts defend"
300,16,128,Thy city only with her own. Be sure it shall descend
300,16,129,To that proof wholly. Not a man of any Lycian rank
300,16,130,Shall strike one stroke more for thy town; for no man gets a thank
300,16,131,"Should he eternally fight here, nor any guard of thee."
300,16,132,"How wilt thou, worthless that thou art, keep off an enemy"
300,16,133,"From our poor soldiers, when their prince, Sarpedon, guest and friend"
300,16,134,"To thee, and most deservedly, thou flew’st from in his end,"
300,16,135,"And left’st to all the lust of Greece? O Gods, a man that was"
300,16,136,"(In life) so huge a good to Troy, and to thee such a grace,"
300,16,137,"(In death) not kept by thee from dogs! If my friends will do well,"
300,16,138,"We’ll take our shoulders from your walls, and let all sink to hell;"
300,16,139,"As all will, were our faces turn’d. Did such a spirit breathe"
300,16,140,"In all you Trojans, as becomes all men that fight beneath"
300,16,141,"Their country’s standard, you would see, that such a prop your cause"
300,16,142,"With like exposure of their lives, have all the honour’d laws"
300,16,143,"Of such a dear confederacy kept to them to a thread,"
300,16,144,As now ye might reprise the arms Sarpedon forfeited
300,16,145,"By forfeit of your rights to him, would you but lend your hands,"
300,16,146,And force Patroclus to your Troy. Ye know how dear he stands
300,16,147,"In his love, that of all the Greeks is, for himself, far best,"
300,16,148,And leads the best near - fighting men; and therefore would at least
300,16,149,"Redeem Sarpedon’s arms; nay him, whom you have likewise lost."
300,16,150,This body drawn to Ilion would after draw and cost
300,16,151,A greater ransom if you pleas’d; but Ajax startles you;
300,16,152,’Tis his breast bars this right to us; his looks are darts enow
300,16,153,"To mix great Hector with his men. And not to blame ye are,"
300,16,154,"You choose foes underneath your strengths, Ajax exceeds ye far.”"
300,16,155,"Hector look’d passing sour at this, and answer’d: “Why dar’st thou,"
300,16,156,"So under, talk above me so? O friend, I thought till now"
300,16,157,Thy wisdom was superior to all th’ inhabitants
300,16,158,Of gleby Lycia; but now impute apparent wants
300,16,159,"To that discretion thy words show, to say I lost my ground"
300,16,160,"For Ajax’ greatness. Nor fear I the field in combats drown’d,"
300,16,161,"Nor force of chariots, but I fear a Pow’r much better seen"
300,16,162,"In right of all war than all we. That God, that holds between"
300,16,163,"Our victory and us his shield, lets conquest come and go"
300,16,164,"At his free pleasure, and with fear converts her changes so"
300,16,165,"Upon the strongest. Men must fight when his just spirit impels,"
300,16,166,"Not their vain glories. But come on, make thy steps parallels"
300,16,167,"To these of mine, and then be judge, how deep the work will draw."
300,16,168,"If then I spend the day in shifts, or thou canst give such law"
300,16,169,"To thy detractive speeches then, or if the Grecian host"
300,16,170,"Holds any that in pride of strength holds up his spirit most,"
300,16,171,"Whom, for the carriage of this prince, that thou enforcest so,"
300,16,172,"I make not stoop in his defence. You, friends, ye hear and know"
300,16,173,"How much it fits ye to make good this Grecian I have slain,"
300,16,174,"For ransom of Jove’s son, our friend. Play then the worthy men,"
300,16,175,"Till I indue Achilles’ arms.” This said, he left the fight,"
300,16,176,"And call’d back those that bore the arms, not yet without his sight,"
300,16,177,"In convoy of them towards Troy. For them he chang’d his own,"
300,16,178,"Remov’d from where it rained tears, and sent them back to town."
300,16,179,"Then put he on th’ eternal arms, that the Celestial States"
300,16,180,"Gave Peleus; Peleus, being old, their use appropriates"
300,16,181,"To his Achilles, that, like him, forsook them not for age."
300,16,182,"When He, whose empire is in clouds, saw Hector bent to wage"
300,16,183,"War in divine Achilles’ arms, he shook his head, and said:"
300,16,184,"“Poor wretch, thy thoughts are far from death, though he so near hath"
300,16,185,laid
300,16,186,"His ambush for thee. Thou putt’st on those arms, as braving him"
300,16,187,"Whom others fear; hast slain his friend, and from his youthful limb"
300,16,188,"Torn rudely off his heav’nly arms, himself being gentle, kind,"
300,16,189,"And valiant. Equal measure then, thy life in youth must find."
300,16,190,"Yet since the justice is so strict, that not Andromache,"
300,16,191,"In thy denied return from fight, must ever take of thee"
300,16,192,"Those arms, in glory of thy acts; thou shalt have that frail blaze"
300,16,193,"Of excellence that neighbours death, a strength ev’n to amaze.”"
300,16,194,To this His sable brows did bow; and he made fit his limb
300,16,195,"To those great arms, to fill which up the War - god enter’d him"
300,16,196,"Austere and terrible, his joints and ev’ry part extends"
300,16,197,With strength and fortitude; and thus to his admiring friends
300,16,198,"High Clamour brought him. He so shin’d, that all could think no less"
300,16,199,But he resembled ev’ry way great - soul’d Æacides.
300,16,200,"Then ev’ry way he scour’d the field, his captains calling on;"
300,16,201,"Asteropæus, Eunomus, that foresaw all things done,"
300,16,202,"Glaucus, and Medon, Desinor, and strong Thersilochus,"
300,16,203,"Phorcis, and Mesthles, Chromius, and great Hippothous;"
300,16,204,"To all these, and their populous troops, these his excitements were:"
300,16,205,"“Hear us, innumerable friends, near - bord’ring nations, hear."
300,16,206,"We have not call’d you from our towns, to fill our idle eye"
300,16,207,With number of so many men (no such vain empery
300,16,208,"Did ever joy us) but to fight; and of our Trojan wives,"
300,16,209,"With all their children, manfully to save the innocent lives."
300,16,210,"In whose cares we draw all our towns of aiding soldiers dry,"
300,16,211,"With gifts, guards, victual, all things fit; and hearten their  supply"
300,16,212,"With all like rights; and therefore now let all sides set down this,"
300,16,213,"Or live, or perish; this of war the special secret is."
300,16,214,"In which most resolute design, whoever bears to town"
300,16,215,"Patroclus, laid dead to his hand, by winning the renown"
300,16,216,"Of Ajax’ slaughter, the half - spoil we wholly will impart"
300,16,217,"To his free use, and to ourself the other half convert;"
300,16,218,"And so the glory shall be shar’d, ourself will have no more"
300,16,219,Then he shall shine in.” This drew all to bring abroad their store
300,16,220,"Before the body. Ev’ry man had hope it would be his,"
300,16,221,"And forc’d from Ajax. Silly fools, Ajax prevented this"
300,16,222,By raising rampires to his friend with half their carcasses.
300,16,223,"And yet his humour was to roar, and fear, and now no less"
300,16,224,"To startle Sparta’s king, to whom he cried out: “O my friend!"
300,16,225,O Menelaus! Now no hope to get off; here’s the end
300,16,226,Of all our labours. Not so much I fear to lose the corse
300,16,227,"(For that’s sure gone, the fowls of Troy and dogs will quickly force"
300,16,228,"That piece - meal) as I fear my head, and thine, O Atreus’ son."
300,16,229,"Hector a cloud brings will hide all. Instant destructión,"
300,16,230,"Grievous and heavy, comes. O call our peers to aid us; fly.”"
300,16,231,"He hasted, and us’d all his voice, sent far and near his cry:"
300,16,232,"“O princes, chief lights of the Greeks, and you that publicly"
300,16,233,"Eat with our General and me, all men of charge, O know"
300,16,234,Jove gives both grace and dignity to any that will show
300,16,235,"Good minds for only good itself, though presently the eye"
300,16,236,"Of him that rules discern him not. ’Tis hard for me t’espy,"
300,16,237,"Through all this smoke of burning fight, each captain in his place,"
300,16,238,"And call assistance to our need. Be then each other’s grace,"
300,16,239,And freely follow each his next. Disdain to let the joy
300,16,240,Of great Æacides be forc’d to feed the beasts of Troy.”
300,16,241,His voice was first heard and obey’d by swift Oïliades;
300,16,242,"Idomenëus and his mate, renown’d Meriones,"
300,16,243,"Were seconds to Oïleus’ son; but, of the rest, whose mind"
300,16,244,"Can lay upon his voice the names, that after these combin’d"
300,16,245,In setting up this fight on end? The Trojans first gave on.
300,16,246,"And as into the sea’s vast mouth, when mighty rivers run,"
300,16,247,"Their billows and the sea resound, and all the utter shore"
300,16,248,Rebellows in her angry shocks the sea’s repulsive roar;
300,16,249,"With such sounds gave the Trojans charge, so was their charge"
300,16,250,repress’d.
300,16,251,"One mind fill’d all Greeks, good brass shields close couch’d to ev’ry"
300,16,252,"breast,"
300,16,253,"And on their bright helms Jove pour’d down a mighty deal of night,"
300,16,254,"To hide Patroclus; whom alive, and when he was the knight"
300,16,255,"Of that grandchild of Æacus, Saturnius did not hate,"
300,16,256,"Nor dead would see him dealt to dogs, and so did instigate"
300,16,257,His fellows to his worthy guard. At first the Trojans drave
300,16,258,The black - ey’d Grecians from the corse; but not a blow they gave
300,16,259,"That came at death. Awhile they hung about the body’s heels,"
300,16,260,"The Greeks quite gone. But all that while, did Ajax whet the steels"
300,16,261,"Of all his forces, that cut back way to the corse again."
300,16,262,"Brave Ajax (that for form and fact, pass’d all that did maintain"
300,16,263,"The Grecian fame, next Thetis’ son) now flew before the first."
300,16,264,And as a sort of dogs and youths are by a boar disperst
300,16,265,"About a mountain; so fled these from mighty Ajax, all"
300,16,266,"That stood in conflict for the corse, who thought no chance could fall"
300,16,267,"Betwixt them and the prise at Troy; for both Hippothous,"
300,16,268,"Lethus’ Pelasgus’ famous son, was so adventurous"
300,16,269,"That he would stand to bore the corse about the ancle - bone,"
300,16,270,"Where all the nervy fibres meet and ligaments in one,"
300,16,271,That make the motion of those parts; through which he did convey
300,16,272,"The thong or bawdric of his shield, and so was drawing away"
300,16,273,All thanks from Hector and his friends; but in their stead he drew
300,16,274,An ill that no man could avert; for Telamonius threw
300,16,275,"A lance that strook quite through his helm, his brain came leaping out;"
300,16,276,"Down fell Letheides, and with him the body’s hoisted foot."
300,16,277,Far from Larissa’s soil he fell; a little time allow’d
300,16,278,To his industrious spirits to quit the benefits bestow’d
300,16,279,"By his kind parents. But his wreak Priamides assay’d,"
300,16,280,"And threw at Ajax; but his dart, discover’d, pass’d, and stay’d"
300,16,281,"At Schedius, son of Iphitus, a man of ablest hand"
300,16,282,"Of all the strong Phocensians, and liv’d with great command"
300,16,283,"In Panopëus. The fell dart fell through his channel - bone,"
300,16,284,"Pierc’d through his shoulder’s upper part, and set his spirit gone."
300,16,285,"When after his another flew, the same hand giving wing"
300,16,286,"To martial Phorcis’ startled soul, that was the after spring"
300,16,287,"Of Phænops’ seed. The jav’lin strook his curets through, and tore"
300,16,288,The bowels from the belly’s midst. His fall made those before
300,16,289,"Give back a little, Hector’s self enforc’d to turn his face."
300,16,290,"And then the Greeks bestow’d their shouts, took vantage of the chace,"
300,16,291,"Drew off, and spoil’d Hippothous and Phorcis of their arms."
300,16,292,"And then ascended Ilion had shaken with alarms,"
300,16,293,"Discov’ring th’ impotence of Troy, ev’n past the will of Jove,"
300,16,294,"And by the proper force of Greece, had Phœbus fail’d to move"
300,16,295,Æneas in similitude of Periphas (the son
300,16,296,"Of grave Epytes) king at arms, and had good service done"
300,16,297,"To old Anchises, being wise, and ev’n with him in years."
300,16,298,"But, like this man, the far - seen God to Venus’ son appears,"
300,16,299,"And ask’d him how he would maintain steep Ilion in her height,"
300,16,300,"In spite of Gods, as he presum’d; when men approv’d so slight"
300,16,301,"All his presumptions, and all theirs that puff’d him with that pride,"
300,16,302,"Believing in their proper strengths, and gen’rally supplied"
300,16,303,"With such unfrighted multitudes? But he well knew that Jove,"
300,16,304,"Besides their self - conceits, sustain’d their forces with more love"
300,16,305,Than theirs of Greece; and yet all that lack’d pow’r to hearten them.
300,16,306,"Æneas knew the God, and said: “It was a shame extreme,"
300,16,307,"That those of Greece should beat them so, and by their cowardice,"
300,16,308,Not want of man’s aid nor the Gods’; and this before his eyes
300,16,309,"A Deity stood ev’n now and vouch’d, affirming Jove their aid;"
300,16,310,"And so bade Hector and the rest, to whom all this he said,"
300,16,311,"Turn head, and not in that quick ease part with the corse to Greece.”"
300,16,312,"This said, before them all he flew, and all as of a piece"
300,16,313,"Against the Greeks flew. Venus’ son Leocritus did end,"
300,16,314,"Son of Arisbas, and had place of Lycomedes’ friend;"
300,16,315,"Whose fall he friendly pitied, and, in revenge, bestow’d"
300,16,316,"A lance that Apisaon strook, so sore that straight he strow’d"
300,16,317,"The dusty centre, it did stick in that congealéd blood"
300,16,318,That forms the liver. Second man he was of all that stood
300,16,319,"In name for arms amongst the troop that from Pæonia came,"
300,16,320,Asteropæus being the first; who was in ruth the same
300,16,321,"That Lycomedes was; like whom, he put forth for the wreak"
300,16,322,"Of his slain friend; but wrought it not, because he could not break"
300,16,323,"That bulwark made of Grecian shields, and bristled wood of spears,"
300,16,324,Combin’d about the body slain. Amongst whom Ajax bears
300,16,325,"The greatest labour, ev’ry way exhorting to abide,"
300,16,326,"And no man fly the corse a foot, nor break their ranks in pride"
300,16,327,"Of any foremost daring spirit, but each foot hold his stand,"
300,16,328,And use the closest fight they could. And this was the command
300,16,329,"Of mighty Ajax; which observ’d, they steep’d the earth in blood."
300,16,330,The Trojans and their friends fell thick. Nor all the Grecians stood
300,16,331,(Though far the fewer suffer’d fate) for ever they had care
300,16,332,"To shun confusion, and the toil that still oppresseth there."
300,16,333,So set they all the field on fire; with which you would have thought
300,16,334,"The sun and moon had been put out, in such a smoke they fought"
300,16,335,About the person of the prince. But all the field beside
300,16,336,"Fought underneath a lightsome heav’n; the sun was in his pride,"
300,16,337,"And such expansure of his beams he thrust out of his throne,"
300,16,338,"That not a vapour durst appear in all that region,"
300,16,339,"No, not upon the highest hill. There fought they still, and breath’d,"
300,16,340,"Shunn’d danger, cast their darts aloof, and not a sword unsheath’d."
300,16,341,"The other plied it, and the war and night plied them as well,"
300,16,342,The cruel steel afflicting all; the strongest did not dwell
300,16,343,Unhurt within their iron roofs. Two men of special name.
300,16,344,"Antilochus and Thrasymed, were yet unserv’d by Fame"
300,16,345,With notice of Patroclus’ death. They thought him still alive
300,16,346,"In foremost tumult, and might well, for (seeing their fellows thrive"
300,16,347,In no more comfortable sort than fight and death would yield)
300,16,348,"They fought apart; for so their sire, old Nestor, strictly will’d,"
300,16,349,Enjoining fight more from the fleet. War here increas’d his heat
300,16,350,"The whole day long, continually the labour and the sweat"
300,16,351,"The knees, calves, feet, hands, faces, smear’d, of men that Mars"
300,16,352,applied
300,16,353,About the good Achilles’ friend. And as a huge ox - hide[3]
300,16,354,"A currier gives amongst his men, to supple and extend"
300,16,355,"With oil till it be drunk withall; they tug, stretch out, and spend"
300,16,356,"Their oil and liquor lib’rally, and chafe the leather so"
300,16,357,"That out they make a vapour breathe, and in their oil doth go,"
300,16,358,"A number of them set on work, and in an orb they pull,"
300,16,359,That all ways all parts of the hide they may extend at full;
300,16,360,"So here and there did both parts hale the corse in little place,"
300,16,361,And wrought it all ways with their sweat; the Trojans hop’d for grace
300,16,362,"To make it reach to Ilion, the Grecians to their fleet,"
300,16,363,"A cruel tumult they stirr’d up, and such as should Mars see’t"
300,16,364,"(That horrid hurrier of men) or She that betters him,"
300,16,365,"Minerva, never so incens’d, they could not disesteem."
300,16,366,So baneful a contention did Jove that day extend
300,16,367,Of men and horse about the slain. Of whom his god - like friend
300,16,368,"Had no instruction, so far off, and underneath the wall"
300,16,369,"Of Troy, that conflict was maintain’d; which was not thought at all"
300,16,370,"By great Achilles, since he charg’d, that having set his foot"
300,16,371,"Upon the ports, he would retire, well knowing Troy no boot"
300,16,372,"For his assaults without himself, since not by him as well"
300,16,373,He knew it was to be subdu’d. His mother oft would tell
300,16,374,"The mind of mighty Jove therein, oft hearing it in heav’n;"
300,16,375,But of that great ill to his friend was no instruction giv’n
300,16,376,By careful Thetis. By degrees must ill events be known.
300,16,377,"The foes cleft one to other still, about the overthrown."
300,16,378,His death with death infected both. Ev’n private Greeks would say
300,16,379,"Either to other: “’Twere a shame, for us to go our way,"
300,16,380,And let the Trojans bear to Troy the praise of such a prise!
300,16,381,"Which, let the black earth gasp, and drink our blood for sacrifice,"
300,16,382,"Before we suffer. ’Tis an act much less infortunate,"
300,16,383,"And then would those of Troy resolve, though certainly our fate"
300,16,384,Will fell us altogether here. Of all not turn a face.”
300,16,385,"Thus either side his fellows’ strength excited past his place,"
300,16,386,"And thus through all th’ unfruitful air, an iron sound ascended"
300,16,387,Up to the golden firmament; when strange affects contended
300,16,388,"In these immortal heav’n - bred horse of great Æacides,"
300,16,389,Whom (once remov’d from forth the fight) a sudden sense did seize
300,16,390,"Of good Patroclus’ death, whose hands they oft had undergone,"
300,16,391,And bitterly they wept for him. Nor could Automedon
300,16,392,"With any manage make them stir, oft use the scourge to them,"
300,16,393,"Oft use his fairest speech, as oft threats never so extreme,"
300,16,394,"They neither to the Hellespont would bear him, nor the fight;"
300,16,395,But still as any tombstone lays his never stirréd weight
300,16,396,On some good man or woman’s grave for rites of funeral;
300,16,397,"So unremovéd stood these steeds, their heads to earth let fall,"
300,16,398,"And warm tears gushing from their eyes, with passionate desire"
300,16,399,"Of their kind manager; their manes, that flourish’d with the fire"
300,16,400,"Of endless youth allotted them, fell through the yoky sphere,"
300,16,401,"Ruthfully ruffled and defil’d, Jove saw their heavy cheer,"
300,16,402,"And, pitying them, spake to his mind: “Poor wretched beasts,” said he,"
300,16,403,"“Why gave we you t’ a mortal king, when immortality"
300,16,404,And incapacity of age so dignifies your states?
300,16,405,Was it to haste the miseries pour’d out on human fates?
300,16,406,"Of all the miserablest things that breathe and creep on earth,"
300,16,407,"No one more wretched is than man. And for your deathless birth,"
300,16,408,"Hector must fail to make you prise. Is’t not enough he wears,"
300,16,409,"And glories vainly in those arms? Your chariots and rich gears,"
300,16,410,"Besides you, are too much for him. Your knees and spirits again"
300,16,411,"My care of you shall fill with strength, that so ye may sustain"
300,16,412,"Automedon, and bear him off. To Troy I still will give"
300,16,413,"The grace of slaughter, till at fleet their bloody feet arrive,"
300,16,414,"Till Phœbus drink the western sea, and sacred Darkness throws"
300,16,415,Her sable mantle ’twixt their points.” Thus in the steeds he blows
300,16,416,Excessive spirit; and through the Greeks and Ilians they rapt
300,16,417,"The whirring chariot, shaking off the crumbled centre wrapt"
300,16,418,"Amongst their tresses. And with them, Automedon let fly"
300,16,419,"Amongst the Trojans, making way through all as frightfully"
300,16,420,"As through a jangling flock of geese a lordly vulture beats,"
300,16,421,"Giv’n way with shrikes by ev’ry goose, that comes but near his threats;"
300,16,422,"With such state fled he through the press, pursuing as he fled;"
300,16,423,"But made no slaughter; nor he could, alone being carried"
300,16,424,"Upon the sacred chariot. How could he both works do,"
300,16,425,"Direct his jav’lin, and command his fi’ry horses too?"
300,16,426,"At length he came where he beheld his friend Alcimedon,"
300,16,427,"That was the good Laercius’, the son of Æmon’s, son;"
300,16,428,"Who close came to his chariot side, and ask’d: “What God is he"
300,16,429,"That hath so robb’d thee of thy soul, to run thus franticly"
300,16,430,"Amongst these fore fights, being alone; thy fighter being slain,"
300,16,431,And Hector glorying in his arms?” He gave these words again:
300,16,432,"“Alcimedon, what man is he, of all the Argive race,"
300,16,433,"So able as thyself to keep, in use of press and pace,"
300,16,434,"These deathless horse; himself being gone, that like the Gods had th’"
300,16,435,art
300,16,436,"Of their high manage? Therefore take to thy command his part,"
300,16,437,"And ease me of the double charge, which thou hast blam’d with right.”"
300,16,438,"He took the scourge and reins in hand, Automedon the fight."
300,16,439,"Which Hector seeing, instantly, Æneas standing near,"
300,16,440,"He told him, he discern’d the horse, that mere immortal were,"
300,16,441,"Address’d to fight with coward guides, and therefore hop’d to make"
300,16,442,"A rich prise of them, if his mind would help to undertake,"
300,16,443,"For those two could not stand their charge. He granted, and both cast"
300,16,444,"Dry solid hides upon their necks, exceeding soundly brast;"
300,16,445,"And forth they went, associate with two more god - like men,"
300,16,446,Aretus and bold Chromius; nor made they question then
300,16,447,"To prise the goodly - crested horse, and safely send to hell"
300,16,448,"The souls of both their guardians. O fools, that could not tell"
300,16,449,They could not work out their return from fierce Automedon
300,16,450,Without the lib’ral cost of blood; who first made orison
300,16,451,"To father Jove, and then was fill’d with fortitude and strength;"
300,16,452,When (counselling Alcimedon to keep at no great length
300,16,453,"The horse from him, but let them breathe upon his back, because"
300,16,454,"He saw th’ advance that Hector made, whose fury had no laws"
300,16,455,"Propos’d to it, but both their lives and those horse made his prise,"
300,16,456,"Or his life theirs) he call’d to friend these well - approv’d supplies,"
300,16,457,"Th’ Ajaces, and the Spartan king, and said, “Come, princes, leave"
300,16,458,"A sure guard with the corse, and then to your kind care receive"
300,16,459,Our threaten’d safeties. I discern the two chief props of Troy
300,16,460,"Prepar’d against us. But herein, what best men can enjoy"
300,16,461,Lies in the free knees of the Gods. My dart shall lead ye all[4]
300,16,462,"The sequel to the care of Jove I leave, whatever fall.”"
300,16,463,"All this spake good Automedon; then, brandishing his lance,"
300,16,464,"He threw, and strook Aretus’ shield, that gave it enterance"
300,16,465,"Through all the steel, and, by his belt, his belly’s inmost part"
300,16,466,"It pierc’d, and all his trembling limbs gave life up to his dart."
300,16,467,"Then Hector at Automedon a blazing lance let fly,"
300,16,468,"Whose flight he saw, and falling flat, the compass was too high,"
300,16,469,"And made it stick beyond in earth, th’ extreme part burst, and there"
300,16,470,Mars buried all his violence. The sword then for the spear
300,16,471,"Had chang’d the conflict, had not haste sent both th’ Ajaces in,"
300,16,472,"Both serving close their fellows’ call, who, where they did begin,"
300,16,473,"There drew the end. Priamides, Æneas, Chromius"
300,16,474,(In doubt of what such aid might work) left broken hearted thus
300,16,475,"Aretus to Automedon, who spoil’d his arms, and said:"
300,16,476,"“A little this revives my life for him so lately dead,"
300,16,477,Though by this nothing countervail’d.” And with this little vent
300,16,478,"Of inward grief, he took the spoil; with which he made ascent"
300,16,479,"Up to his chariot, hands and feet of bloody stains so full"
300,16,480,"That lion - like he look’d, new turn’d from tearing up a bull."
300,16,481,"And now another bitter fight about Patroclus grew,"
300,16,482,"Tear - thirsty, and of toil enough; which Pallas did renew,"
300,16,483,"Descending from the cope of stars, dismiss’d by sharp - ey’d Jove"
300,16,484,"To animate the Greeks; for now, inconstant change did move"
300,16,485,His mind from what he held of late. And as the purple bow
300,16,486,"Jove bends at mortals, when of war he will the signal show,"
300,16,487,"Or make it a presage of cold, in such tempestuous sort"
300,16,488,"That men are of their labours eas’d, but labouring cattle hurt;"
300,16,489,"So Pallas in a purple cloud involv’d herself, and went"
300,16,490,"Amongst the Grecians, stirr’d up all; but first encouragement"
300,16,491,"She breath’d in Atreus’ younger son, and, for disguise, made choice"
300,16,492,"Of aged Phœnix’ shape, and spake with his unwearied voice:"
300,16,493,"“O Menelaus, much defame, and equal heaviness,"
300,16,494,"Will touch at thee, if this true friend of great Æacides"
300,16,495,Dogs tear beneath the Trojan walls; and therefore bear thee well.
300,16,496,"Toil through the host, and ev’ry man with all thy spirit impell.”"
300,16,497,"He answer’d: “O thou long - since born, O Phœnix, that hast won"
300,16,498,"The honour’d foster - father’s name of Thetis’ god - like son,"
300,16,499,"I would Minerva would but give strength to me, and but keep"
300,16,500,"These busy darts off; I would then make in indeed, and steep"
300,16,501,"My income in their bloods, in aid of good Patroclus; much"
300,16,502,"His death afflicts me, much. But yet, this Hector’s grace is such"
300,16,503,"With Jove, and such a fi’ry strength and spirit he has, that still"
300,16,504,"His steel is killing, killing still.” The king’s so royal will"
300,16,505,"Minerva joy’d to hear, since she did all the Gods outgo"
300,16,506,In his remembrance. For which grace she kindly did bestow
300,16,507,"Strength on his shoulders, and did fill his knees as lib’rally"
300,16,508,"With swiftness, breathing in his breast the courage of a fly,"
300,16,509,"Which loves to bite so, and doth bear man’s blood so much good will,"
300,16,510,That still though beaten from a man she flies upon him still;
300,16,511,"With such a courage Pallas fill’d the black parts near his heart,"
300,16,512,"And then he hasted to the slain, cast off a shining dart,"
300,16,513,"And took one Podes, that was heir to old Eetion,"
300,16,514,"A rich man and a strenuous, and by the people done"
300,16,515,"Much honour, and by Hector too, being consort and his guest;"
300,16,516,And him the yellow - headed king laid hold on at his waist
300,16,517,"In off’ring flight, his iron pile strook through him, down he fell,"
300,16,518,And up Atrides drew his corse. Then Phœbus did impell
300,16,519,"The spirit of Hector, Phænops like, surnam’d Asiades,"
300,16,520,"Whom Hector us’d, of all his guests, with greatest friendliness,"
300,16,521,And in Abydus stood his house; in whose form thus he spake:
300,16,522,“Hector! What man of all the Greeks will any terror make
300,16,523,"Of meeting thy strength any more, when thou art terrified"
300,16,524,"By Menelaus, who, before he slew thy friend, was tried"
300,16,525,"A passing easy soldier, where now (besides his end"
300,16,526,"Impos’d by him) he draws him off, and not a man to friend."
300,16,527,"From all the Trojans? This friend is Podes, Eetion’s son.”"
300,16,528,"This hid him in a cloud of grief, and set him foremost on."
300,16,529,"And then Jove took his snake - fring’d shield, and Ida cover’d all"
300,16,530,"With sulphury clouds, from whence he let abhorréd lightnings fall,"
300,16,531,And thunder’d till the mountains shook; and with this dreadful state
300,16,532,"He usher’d victory to Troy, to Argos flight and fate."
300,16,533,"Peneleüs Bœotius was he that foremost fled,"
300,16,534,Being wounded in his shoulder’s height; but there the lance’s head
300,16,535,"Strook lightly, glancing to his mouth, because it strook him near,"
300,16,536,Thrown from Polydamas. Leitus next left the fight in fear
300,16,537,(Being hurt by Hector in his hand) because he doubted sore
300,16,538,His hand in wishéd fight with Troy would hold his lance no more.
300,16,539,"Idomenëus sent a dart at Hector (rushing in,"
300,16,540,"And following Leitus) that strook his bosom near his chin,"
300,16,541,And brake at top. The Ilians for his escape did shout.
300,16,542,"When Hector at Deucalides another lance sent out,"
300,16,543,"As in his chariot he stood; it miss’d him narrowly,"
300,16,544,"For, as it fell, Cœranus drave his speedy chariot by,"
300,16,545,And took the Trojan lance himself; he was the charioteer
300,16,546,"Of stern Meriones, and first on foot did service there,"
300,16,547,"Which well he left to govern horse, for saving now his king,"
300,16,548,"With driving ’twixt him and his death, though thence his own did"
300,16,549,"spring,"
300,16,550,"Which kept a mighty victory from Troy, in keeping death"
300,16,551,From his great sov’reign. The fierce dart did enter him beneath
300,16,552,"His ear, betwixt his jaw and it, drave down, cut through his tongue,"
300,16,553,"And strook his teeth out; from his hands the horses’ reins he flung,"
300,16,554,"Which now Meriones receiv’d as they bestrew’d the field,"
300,16,555,"And bade his sov’reign scourge away, he saw that day would yield"
300,16,556,"No hope of victory for them. He fear’d the same, and fled."
300,16,557,"Nor from the mighty - minded son of Telamon lay hid,"
300,16,558,"For all his clouds, high Jove himself, nor from the Spartan king."
300,16,559,"They saw Him in the victory, He still was varying"
300,16,560,"For Troy. For which sight Ajax said: “O heav’ns, what fool is he"
300,16,561,That sees not Jove’s hand in the grace now done our enemy?
300,16,562,"Not any dart they touch but takes, from whomsoever thrown,"
300,16,563,"Valiant or coward; what he wants Jove adds, not any one"
300,16,564,Wants his direction to strike sure; nor ours to miss as sure.
300,16,565,"But come, let us be sure of this, to put the best in ure"
300,16,566,"That lies in us; which two - fold is, both to fetch off our friend,"
300,16,567,And so to fetch him off as we may likeliest contend
300,16,568,To fetch ourselves off; that our friends surviving may have right
300,16,569,"In joy of our secure retreat, as he that fell in fight,"
300,16,570,"Being kept as sure from further wrong. Of which perhaps they doubt,"
300,16,571,"And looking this way, grieve for us, not able to work out"
300,16,572,"Our pass from this man - slaughterer, great Hector, and his hands"
300,16,573,"That are too hot for men to touch, but that these thirsty sands"
300,16,574,Before our fleet will be enforc’d to drink our headlong death.
300,16,575,"Which to prevent by all fit means, I would the parted breath"
300,16,576,"Of good Patroclus, to his friend, with speed imparted were,"
300,16,577,"By some he loves; for, I believe, no heavy messenger"
300,16,578,"Hath yet inform’d him. But alas! I see no man to send,"
300,16,579,Both men and horse are hid in mists that ev’ry way descend.
300,16,580,"O father Jupiter, do thou the sons of Greece release"
300,16,581,Of this felt darkness; grace this day with fit transparences;
300,16,582,"And give the eyes thou giv’st, their use; destroy us in the light,"
300,16,583,"And work thy will with us, since needs thou wilt against us fight.”"
300,16,584,"This spake he weeping, and his tears Saturnius pity show’d,"
300,16,585,"Dispers’d the darkness instantly, and drew away the cloud"
300,16,586,"From whence it fell; the sun shin’d out, and all the host appear’d;"
300,16,587,"And then spake Ajax, whose heard pray’r his spirits highly cheer’d:"
300,16,588,"“Brave Menelaus, look about; and if thou canst descry"
300,16,589,"Nestor’s Antilochus alive, incite him instantly"
300,16,590,"To tell Achilles that his friend, most dear to him, is dead.”"
300,16,591,"He said, nor Menelaus stuck at any thing he said,"
300,16,592,"As loth to do it, but he went. As from a grazier’s stall"
300,16,593,"A lion goes, when overlaid with men, dogs, darts, and all,"
300,16,594,"Not eas’ly losing a fat ox, but strong watch all night held,"
300,16,595,"His teeth yet wat’ring, oft he comes, and is as oft repell’d,"
300,16,596,"The adverse darts so thick are pour’d before his brow - hid eyes,"
300,16,597,"And burning firebrands which, for all his great heart’s heat, he flies,"
300,16,598,"And, grumbling, goes his way betimes; so from Patroclus went"
300,16,599,"Atrides, much against his mind, his doubts being vehement"
300,16,600,"Lest, he gone from his guard, the rest would leave for very fear"
300,16,601,The person to the spoil of Greece. And yet his guardians were
300,16,602,"Th’ Ajaces and Meriones; whom much his care did press,"
300,16,603,"And thus exhort: “Ajaces both, and you Meriones,"
300,16,604,Now let some true friend call to mind the gentle and sweet nature
300,16,605,"Of poor Patroclus; let him think, how kind to ev’ry creature"
300,16,606,"His heart was living, though now dead.” Thus urg’d the fair - hair’d"
300,16,607,"king,"
300,16,608,"And parted, casting round his eye. As when upon her wing"
300,16,609,"An eagle is, whom men affirm to have the sharpest sight"
300,16,610,"Of all air’s region of fowls, and, though of mighty height,"
300,16,611,"Sees yet within her leavy form of humble shrubs, close laid,"
300,16,612,"A light - foot hare, which straight she stoops, trusses, and strikes her"
300,16,613,dead;
300,16,614,"So dead thou strook’st thy charge, O king, through all war’s thickets"
300,16,615,so
300,16,616,"Thou look’dst, and swiftly found’st thy man exhorting ’gainst the foe,"
300,16,617,And heart’ning his plied men to blows us’d in the war’s left wing;
300,16,618,"To whom thou saidst: “Thou god - lov’d man, come here, and hear a thing"
300,16,619,Which I wish never were to hear. I think ev’n thy eye sees
300,16,620,"What a destruction God hath laid upon the sons of Greece,"
300,16,621,"And what a conquest he gives Troy; in which the best of men,"
300,16,622,"Patroclus, lies exanimate, whose person passing fain"
300,16,623,The Greeks would rescue and bear home; and therefore give thy speed
300,16,624,"To his great friend, to prove if he will do so good a deed"
300,16,625,"To fetch the naked person off, for Hector’s shoulders wear"
300,16,626,His priséd arms.” Antilochus was highly griev’d to hear
300,16,627,"This heavy news, and stood surpris’d with stupid silence long;"
300,16,628,"His fair eyes standing full of tears; his voice, so sweet and strong"
300,16,629,Stuck in his bosom; yet all this wrought in him no neglect
300,16,630,"Of what Atrides gave in charge, but for that quick effect"
300,16,631,He gave Laodocus his arms (his friend that had the guide
300,16,632,Of his swift horse) and then his knees were speedily applied
300,16,633,"In his sad message, which his eyes told all the way in tears."
300,16,634,"Nor would thy gen’rous heart assist his sore charg’d soldiers,"
300,16,635,"O Menelaus, in mean time, though left in much distress;"
300,16,636,"Thou sent’st them god - like Thrasymede, and mad’st thy kind regress"
300,16,637,"Back to Patroclus; where arriv’d, half breathless thou didst say"
300,16,638,To both th’ Ajaces: “I have sent this messenger away
300,16,639,"To swift Achilles, who, I fear, will hardly help us now,"
300,16,640,"Though mad with Hector; without arms he cannot fight, ye know."
300,16,641,"Let us then think of some best mean, both how we may remove"
300,16,642,"The body, and get off ourselves from this vocif’rous drove,"
300,16,643,"And fate of Trojans.” “Bravely spoke at all parts,” Ajax said,"
300,16,644,"“O glorious son of Atreus. Take thou then straight the dead,"
300,16,645,"And thou, Meriones; we two, of one mind as one name,"
300,16,646,"Will back ye soundly, and on us receive the wild - fire flame"
300,16,647,"That Hector’s rage breathes after you, before it come at you.”"
300,16,648,"This said, they took into their arms the body; all the show,"
300,16,649,"That might be, made to those of Troy; at arm’s end bearing it."
300,16,650,"Out shriek’d the Trojans when they saw the body borne to fleet,"
300,16,651,"And rush’d on. As at any boar, gash’d with the hunter’s wounds,"
300,16,652,A kennel of the sharpest set and sorest bitten hounds
300,16,653,"Before their youthful huntsmen haste, and eagerly awhile"
300,16,654,"Pursue, as if they were assur’d of their affected spoil;"
300,16,655,"But when the savage, in his strength as confident as they,"
300,16,656,"Turns head amongst them, back they fly, and ev’ry one his way;"
300,16,657,"So troop - meal Troy pursu’d awhile, laying on with swords and darts;"
300,16,658,"But when th’ Ajaces turn’d on them, and made their stand, their hearts"
300,16,659,"Drunk from their faces all their bloods, and not a man sustain’d"
300,16,660,"The forechace, nor the after - fight. And thus Greece nobly gain’d"
300,16,661,"The person towards home. But thus, the changing war was rack’d"
300,16,662,"Out to a passing bloody length; for as, once put in act,"
300,16,663,"A fire, invading city roofs, is suddenly engrost,"
300,16,664,"And made a wondrous mighty flame, in which is quickly lost"
300,16,665,"A house long building, all the while a boist’rous gust of wind"
300,16,666,"Lumb’ring amongst it; so the Greeks, in bearing off their friend,"
300,16,667,"More and more foes drew, at their heels a tumult thund’ring still"
300,16,668,"Of horse and foot. Yet as when mules, in haling from a hill"
300,16,669,"A beam or mast, through foul deep way, well - clapp’d, and hearten’d,"
300,16,670,close
300,16,671,"Lie to their labour, tug and sweat, and passing hard it goes,"
300,16,672,"Urg’d by their drivers to all haste; so dragg’d they on the corse,"
300,16,673,"Still both th’ Ajaces at their backs, who back still turn’d the force,"
300,16,674,Though after it grew still the more. Yet as a sylvan hill
300,16,675,"Thrusts back a torrent, that hath kept a narrow channel still,"
300,16,676,"Till at his oaken breast it beats, but there a check it takes,"
300,16,677,"That sends it over all the vale, with all the stir it makes,"
300,16,678,Nor can with all the confluence break through his rooty sides;
300,16,679,"In no less firm and brave repulse, th’ Ajaces curb’d the prides"
300,16,680,"Of all the Trojans; yet all held the pursuit in his strength,"
300,16,681,"Their chiefs being Hector, and the son of Venus, who at length"
300,16,682,"Put all the youth of Greece besides in most amazeful rout,"
300,16,683,"Forgetting all their fortitudes, distraught, and shrieking out"
300,16,684,"A number of their rich arms lost, fall’n from them here and there,"
300,16,685,"About, and in the dike; and yet, the war concludes not here."
300,16,686,THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK.
300,16,687,"[1] This Euphorbus was he that, in Ovid, Pythagoras saith he was in"
300,16,688,the wars of Troy.
300,16,689,[2] Note the manly and wise discourse of Menelaus with himself seeing
300,16,690,Hector advancing towards him.
300,16,691,[3] An inimitable simile.
300,16,692,"[4] In the Greek always this phrase is used, not in the hands, but ἐν"

300,17,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,17,2,"Achilles mourns, told of Patroclus’ end;"
300,17,3,When Thetis doth from forth the sea ascend
300,17,4,"And comfort him, advising to abstain"
300,17,5,From any fight till her request could gain
300,17,6,Fit arms of Vulcan. Juno yet commands
300,17,7,To show himself. And at the dike he stands
300,17,8,"In sight of th’ enemy, who with his sight"
300,17,9,Flies; and a number perish in the flight.
300,17,10,Patroclus’ person (safe brought from the wars)
300,17,11,His soldiers wash. Vulcan the arms prepares.
300,17,12,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,17,13,"Sigma continues the alarms,"
300,17,14,And fashions the renownéd arms.
300,17,15,They fought still like the rage of fire. And now Antilochus
300,17,16,"Came to Æacides, whose mind was much solicitous"
300,17,17,"For that which, as he fear’d, was fall’n. He found him near the fleet"
300,17,18,"With upright sail - yards, utt’ring this to his heroic conceit:"
300,17,19,"“Ah me! Why see the Greeks themselves thus beaten from the field,"
300,17,20,And routed headlong to their fleet? O let not heaven yield
300,17,21,"Effect to what my sad soul fears, that, as I was foretold,"
300,17,22,"The strongest Myrmidon next me, when I should still behold"
300,17,23,"The sun’s fair light, must part with it. Past doubt Menœtius’ son"
300,17,24,"Is he on whom that fate is wrought. O wretch, to leave undone"
300,17,25,"What I commanded; that, the fleet once freed of hostile fire,"
300,17,26,"Not meeting Hector, instantly he should his pow’rs retire.”"
300,17,27,"As thus his troubled mind discours’d, Antilochus appear’d,"
300,17,28,"And told with tears the sad news thus: “My lord, that must be heard"
300,17,29,"Which would to heav’n I might not tell! Menœtius’ son lies dead,"
300,17,30,"And for his naked corse (his arms already forfeited,"
300,17,31,And worn by Hector) the debate is now most vehement.”
300,17,32,"This said, grief darken’d all his pow’rs. With both his hands he rent"
300,17,33,"The black mould from the forcéd earth, and pour’d it on his head,"
300,17,34,"Smear’d all his lovely face; his weeds, divinely fashionéd,"
300,17,35,"All fil’d and mangled; and himself he threw upon the shore,"
300,17,36,"Lay, as laid out for funeral, then tumbled round, and tore"
300,17,37,"His gracious curls. His ecstasy he did so far extend,"
300,17,38,"That all the ladies won by him and his now slaughter’d friend,"
300,17,39,"Afflicted strangely for his plight, came shrieking from the tents,"
300,17,40,"And fell about him, beat their breasts, their tender lineaments"
300,17,41,"Dissolv’d with sorrow. And with them wept Nestor’s warlike son,"
300,17,42,"Fell by him, holding his fair hands, in fear he would have done"
300,17,43,"His person violence; his heart, extremely straiten’d, burn’d,"
300,17,44,"Beat, swell’d, and sigh’d as it would burst. So terribly he mourn’d,"
300,17,45,"That Thetis, sitting in the deeps of her old father’s seas,"
300,17,46,"Heard, and lamented. To her plaints the bright Nereides"
300,17,47,"Flock’d all, how many those dark gulfs soever comprehend."
300,17,48,"There Glauce, and Cymodoce, and Spio, did attend,"
300,17,49,"Nessea, and Cymothoe, and calm Amphithoe,"
300,17,50,"Thalia, Thoa, Panope, and swift Dynamene,"
300,17,51,"Actæa, and Limnoria, and Halia the fair"
300,17,52,"Fam’d for the beauty of her eyes, Amathia for her hair,"
300,17,53,"Iæra, Proto, Clymene, and curl’d Dexamene,"
300,17,54,"Pherusa, Doris, and with these the smooth Amphinome,"
300,17,55,"Chaste Galatea so renown’d, and Callianira, came,"
300,17,56,"With Doto and Orythia, to cheer the mournful dame."
300,17,57,"Apseudes likewise visited, and Callianassa gave"
300,17,58,"Her kind attendance, and with her Agave grac’d the cave,"
300,17,59,"Nemertes, Mæra, followéd, Melita, Ianesse,"
300,17,60,"With Ianira, and the rest of those Nereides"
300,17,61,That in the deep seas make abode; all which together beat
300,17,62,"Their dewy bosoms; and to all, thus Thetis did repeat"
300,17,63,"Her cause of mourning: “Sisters, hear, how much the sorrows weigh,"
300,17,64,Whose cries now call’d ye. Hapless I brought forth unhappily
300,17,65,"The best of all the sons of men; who, like a well - set plant"
300,17,66,"In best soils, grew and flourishéd; and when his spirit did want"
300,17,67,"Employment for his youth and strength, I sent him with a fleet"
300,17,68,To fight at Ilion; from whence his fate - confinéd feet
300,17,69,"Pass all my deity to retire. The court of his high birth,"
300,17,70,"The glorious court of Peleüs, must entertain his worth"
300,17,71,Never hereafter. All the life he hath to live with me
300,17,72,"Must waste in sorrows. And this son I now am bent to see,"
300,17,73,"Being now afflicted with some grief not usually grave,"
300,17,74,"Whose knowledge and recure I seek.” This said, she left her cave,"
300,17,75,"Which all left with her; swimming forth, the green waves, as they"
300,17,76,"sworn,"
300,17,77,"Cleft with their bosoms, curl’d, and gave quick way to Troy. Being"
300,17,78,"come,"
300,17,79,"They all ascended, two and two, and trod the honour’d shore,"
300,17,80,"Till where the fleet of Myrmidons, drawn up in heaps, it bore."
300,17,81,There stay’d they at Achilles’ ship; and there did Thetis lay
300,17,82,"Her fair hand on her son’s curl’d head, sigh’d, wept, and bade him say"
300,17,83,"What grief drew from his eyes those tears? “Conceal it not,” said she,"
300,17,84,“Till this hour thy uplifted hands have all things granted thee.
300,17,85,"The Greeks, all thrust up at their sterns, have pour’d out tears enow,"
300,17,86,And in them seen how much they miss remission of thy vow.”
300,17,87,"He said, “’Tis true, Olympius hath done me all that grace,"
300,17,88,"But what joy have I of it all, when thus thrusts in the place"
300,17,89,"Loss of my whole self in my friend? Whom, when his foe had slain,"
300,17,90,"He spoil’d of those profanéd arms, that Peleus did obtain"
300,17,91,"From heav’n’s high Pow’rs, solemnizing thy sacred nuptial bands,"
300,17,92,"As th’ only present of them all, and fitted well their hands,"
300,17,93,"Being lovely, radiant, marvellous. O would to heav’n thy throne,"
300,17,94,"With these fair Deities of the sea, thou still hadst sat upon,"
300,17,95,And Peleus had a mortal wife; since by his means is done
300,17,96,"So much wrong to thy grievéd mind, my death being set so soon,"
300,17,97,And never suff’ring my return to grace of Peleus’ court!
300,17,98,"Nor do I wish it; nor to live in any man’s resort,"
300,17,99,"But only that the crying blood, for vengeance of my friend"
300,17,100,"Mangled by Hector, may be still’d; his foe’s death paying his end.”"
300,17,101,"She, weeping, said: “That hour is near, and thy death’s hour then nigh;"
300,17,102,"Which, in thy wish serv’d of thy foe, succeedeth instantly.”"
300,17,103,"“And instantly it shall succeed,” he answer’d “since my fate"
300,17,104,"Allow’d not to my will a pow’r to rescue, ere the date"
300,17,105,"Of his late slaughter, my true friend. Far from his friends he died,"
300,17,106,Whose wrong therein my eyes had light and right to see denied.
300,17,107,"Yet now I neither light myself, nor have so spent my light,"
300,17,108,That either this friend or the rest (in numbers infinite
300,17,109,"Slaughter’d by Hector) I can help, nor grace with wish’d repair"
300,17,110,"To our dear country, but breathe here unprofitable air,"
300,17,111,"And only live a load to earth with all my strength, though none"
300,17,112,Of all the Grecians equal it. In counsel many a one
300,17,113,"Is my superior; what I have, no grace gets; what I want"
300,17,114,Disgraceth all. How then too soon can hastiest death supplant
300,17,115,My fate - curst life? Her instrument to my indignity
300,17,116,Being that black fiend Contention; whom would to God might die
300,17,117,"To Gods and men; and Anger too, that kindles tyranny"
300,17,118,"In men most wise, being much more sweet than liquid honey is"
300,17,119,To men of pow’r to satiate their watchful enmities;
300,17,120,And like a pliant fume it spreads through all their breasts; as late
300,17,121,"It stole stern passage thorough mine, which he did instigate"
300,17,122,"That is our Gen’ral. But the fact so long past, the effect"
300,17,123,"Must vanish with it, though both griev’d; nor must we still respect"
300,17,124,Our soothéd humours. Need now takes the rule of either’s mind.
300,17,125,"And when the loser of my friend his death in me shall find,"
300,17,126,"Let death take all. Send him, ye Gods, I’ll give him my embrace."
300,17,127,"Not Hercules himself shunn’d death, though dearest in the grace"
300,17,128,"Of Jupiter; ev’n him Fate stoop’d, and Juno’s cruelty."
300,17,129,"And if such fate expect my life, where death strikes I will lie."
300,17,130,Meantime I wish a good renown that these deep breasted dames
300,17,131,"Of Ilion and Dardania may, for the extinguish’d flames"
300,17,132,"Of their friends’ lives, with both their hands wipe miserable tears"
300,17,133,"From their so - curiously - kept cheeks, and be the officers"
300,17,134,"To execute my sighs on Troy, when (seeing my long retreat"
300,17,135,"But gather’d strength, and gives my charge an answerable heat)"
300,17,136,"They well may know ’twas I lay still, and that my being away"
300,17,137,Presented all their happiness. But any further stay
300,17,138,(Which your much love perhaps may wish) assay not to persuade;
300,17,139,"All vows are kept, all pray’rs heard; now, free way for fight is made.”"
300,17,140,"The silver - footed Dame replied: “It fits thee well, my son,"
300,17,141,To keep destruction from thy friends; but those fair arms are won
300,17,142,"And worn by Hector, that should keep thyself in keeping them,"
300,17,143,"Though their fruition be but short, a long death being near him,"
300,17,144,Whose cruel glory they are yet. By all means then forbear
300,17,145,"To tread the massacres of war, till I again appear"
300,17,146,"From Mulciber with fit new arms; which, when thy eye shall see"
300,17,147,"The sun next rise, shall enter here with his first beams and me.”"
300,17,148,"Thus to her Sisters of the Sea she turn’d, and bade them ope"
300,17,149,The doors and deeps of Nereüs; she in Olympus’ top
300,17,150,"Must visit Vulcan for new arms to serve her wreakful son,"
300,17,151,"And bade inform her father so, with all things further done."
300,17,152,"This said, they underwent the sea, herself flew up to heav’n."
300,17,153,"In mean space, to the Hellespont and ships the Greeks were driv’n"
300,17,154,"In shameful rout; nor could they yet, from rage of Priam’s son,"
300,17,155,"Secure the dead of new assaults, both horse and men made on"
300,17,156,"With such impression. Thrice the feet the hands of Hector seiz’d,"
300,17,157,"And thrice th’ Ajaces thump’d him off. With whose repulse displeas’d,"
300,17,158,"He wreak’d his wrath upon the troops, then to the corse again"
300,17,159,"Made horrid turnings, crying out of his repulséd men,"
300,17,160,And would not quit him quite for death. A lion almost sterv’d
300,17,161,"Is not by upland herdsman driv’n, from urging to be serv’d,"
300,17,162,"With more contention, than his strength by those two of a name;"
300,17,163,"And had perhaps his much - prais’d will, if th’ airy - footed Dame,"
300,17,164,"Swift Iris, had not stoop’d in haste, ambassadress from heav’n"
300,17,165,"To Peleus’ son, to bid him arm; her message being giv’n"
300,17,166,"By Juno, kept from all the Gods; she thus excited him:"
300,17,167,"“Rise, thou most terrible of men, and save the precious limb"
300,17,168,"Of thy belov’d; in whose behalf, the conflict now runs high"
300,17,169,"Before the fleet, the either host fells other mutually,"
300,17,170,"These to retain, those to obtain. Amongst whom most of all"
300,17,171,"Is Hector prompt, he’s apt to drag thy friend home, he your pall"
300,17,172,"Will make his shoulders; his head forc’d, he’ll be most famous; rise,"
300,17,173,"No more lie idle, set the foe a much more costly prize"
300,17,174,"Of thy friend’s value than let dogs make him a monument,"
300,17,175,"Where thy name will be grav’n.” He ask’d, “What Deity hath sent"
300,17,176,"Thy presence hither?” She replied: “Saturnia, she alone,"
300,17,177,"Not high Jove knowing, nor one God that doth inhabit on"
300,17,178,Snowy Olympus.” He again: “How shall I set upon
300,17,179,"The work of slaughter, when mine arms are worn by Priam’s son?"
300,17,180,"How will my Goddess - mother grieve, that bade I should not arm"
300,17,181,Till she brought arms from Mulciber! But should I do such harm
300,17,182,"To her and duty, who is he, but Ajax, that can vaunt"
300,17,183,The fitting my breast with his arms; and he is conversant
300,17,184,"Amongst the first in use of his, and rampires of the foe"
300,17,185,"Slain near Patroclus builds to him?” “All this,” said she, “we know,"
300,17,186,And wish thou only wouldst but show thy person to the eyes
300,17,187,"Of these hot Ilians, that, afraid of further enterprise,"
300,17,188,"The Greeks may gain some little breath.” She woo’d, and he was won;"
300,17,189,"And straight Minerva honour’d him, who Jove’s shield clapp’d upon"
300,17,190,"His mighty shoulders, and his head girt with a cloud of gold"
300,17,191,That cast beams round about his brows. And as when arms enfold
300,17,192,"A city in an isle, from thence a fume at first appears,"
300,17,193,"Being in the day, but, when the even her cloudy forehead rears,"
300,17,194,"Thick show the fires, and up they cast their splendour, that men nigh,"
300,17,195,"Seeing their distress, perhaps may set ships out to their supply;"
300,17,196,"So (to show such aid) from his head a light rose, scaling heav’n,"
300,17,197,"And forth the wall he stept and stood, nor brake the precept giv’n"
300,17,198,"By his great mother, mix’d in fight, but sent abroad his voice;"
300,17,199,"Which Pallas far - off echoéd, who did betwixt them hoise"
300,17,200,Shrill tumult to a topless height. And as a voice is heard
300,17,201,"With emulous affectión, when any town is spher’d"
300,17,202,"With siege of such a foe as kills men’s minds, and for the town"
300,17,203,Makes sound his trumpet; so the voice from Thetis’ issue thrown
300,17,204,"Won emulously th’ ears of all. His brazen voice once heard,"
300,17,205,The minds of all were startled so they yielded; and so fear’d
300,17,206,"The fair - man’d horses, that they flew back, and their chariots turn’d,"
300,17,207,Presaging in their augurous hearts the labours that they mourn’d
300,17,208,A little after; and their guides a repercussive dread
300,17,209,"Took from the horrid radiance of his refulgent head,"
300,17,210,"Which Pallas set on fire with grace. Thrice great Achilles spake,"
300,17,211,And thrice (in heat of all the charge) the Trojans started back.
300,17,212,"Twelve men, of greatest strength in Troy, left with their lives exhal’d"
300,17,213,"Their chariots and their darts, to death with his three summons call’d."
300,17,214,"And then the Grecians spritefully drew from the darts the corse,"
300,17,215,"And hears’d it, bearing it to fleet; his friends with all remorse"
300,17,216,Marching about it. His great friend dissolving then in tears
300,17,217,"To see his truly - lov’d return’d, so hors’d upon an hearse,"
300,17,218,"Whom with such horse and chariot he set out safe and whole,"
300,17,219,"Now wounded with unpitying steel, now sent without a soul,"
300,17,220,"Never again to be restor’d, never receiv’d but so,"
300,17,221,He follow’d mourning bitterly. The sun (yet far to go)
300,17,222,"Juno commanded to go down; who, in his pow’r’s despite,"
300,17,223,"Sunk to the ocean, over earth dispersing sudden night."
300,17,224,And then the Greeks and Trojans both gave up their horse and darts.
300,17,225,"The Trojans all to council call’d, ere they refresh’d their hearts"
300,17,226,"With any supper, nor would sit; they grew so stiff with fear"
300,17,227,"To see, so long from heavy fight, Æacides appear."
300,17,228,"Polydamas began to speak, who only could discern"
300,17,229,"Things future by things past, and was vow’d friend to Hector, born"
300,17,230,"In one night both. He thus advis’d: “Consider well, my friends,"
300,17,231,"In this so great and sudden change, that now itself extends,"
300,17,232,What change is best for us t’ oppose. To this stands my command:
300,17,233,"Make now the town our strength, not here abide light’s rosy hand,"
300,17,234,"Our wall being far off, and our foe, much greater, still as near."
300,17,235,"Till this foe came, I well was pleas’d to keep our watches here,"
300,17,236,My fit hope of the fleet’s surprise inclin’d me so; but now
300,17,237,"’Tis stronglier guarded, and, their strength increas’d, we must allow"
300,17,238,Our own proportionate amends. I doubt exceedingly
300,17,239,"That this indiff’rency of fight ’twixt us and th’ enemy,"
300,17,240,"And these bounds we prefix to them, will nothing so confine"
300,17,241,Th’ uncurb’d mind of Æacides. The height of his design
300,17,242,Aims at our city and our wives; and all bars in his way
300,17,243,(Being back’d with less than walls) his pow’r will scorn to make his
300,17,244,"stay,"
300,17,245,"And over - run, as over - seen and not his object. Then"
300,17,246,"Let Troy be freely our retreat; lest, being enforc’d, our men"
300,17,247,"‘Twixt this and that be taken up by vultures, who by night"
300,17,248,"May safe come off, it being a time untimely for his might"
300,17,249,To spend at random; that being sure. If next light show us here
300,17,250,"To his assaults, each man will wish, that Troy his refuge were,"
300,17,251,And then feel what he hears not now. I would to heav’n mine ear
300,17,252,"Were free ev’n now of those complaints, that you must after hear"
300,17,253,"If ye remove not! If ye yield, though wearied with a fight"
300,17,254,"So late and long, we shall have strength in council and the night."
300,17,255,"And (where we here have no more force, than need will force us to,"
300,17,256,"And which must rise out of our nerves) high ports, tow’rs, walls will"
300,17,257,do
300,17,258,"What wants in us; and in the morn, all arm’d upon our tow’rs,"
300,17,259,"We all will stand out to our foe. ’Twill trouble all his pow’rs,"
300,17,260,"To come from fleet and give us charge, when his high - crested horse"
300,17,261,"His rage shall satiate with the toil of this and that way’s course,"
300,17,262,"Vain entry seeking underneath our well - defended walls,"
300,17,263,"And he be glad to turn to fleet, about his funerals."
300,17,264,"For of his entry here at home, what mind will serve his thirst,"
300,17,265,Or ever feed him with sack’d Troy? The dogs shall eat him first.”
300,17,266,"At this speech Hector bent his brows, and said: “This makes not great"
300,17,267,"Your grace with me, Polydamas, that argue for retreat"
300,17,268,To Troy’s old prison. Have we not enough of those tow’rs yet?
300,17,269,"And is not Troy yet charg’d enough, with impositions set"
300,17,270,"Upon her citizens, to keep our men from spoil without,"
300,17,271,But still we must impose within? That houses with our rout
300,17,272,"As well as purses may be plagu’d? Before time, Priam’s town"
300,17,273,"Traffick’d with divers - languag’d men, and all gave the renown"
300,17,274,"Of rich Troy to it, brass and gold abounding; but her store"
300,17,275,Is now from ev’ry house exhaust; possessions evermore
300,17,276,Are sold out into Phrygia and lovely Mæony;
300,17,277,And have been ever since Jove’s wrath. And now his clemency
300,17,278,"Gives me the mean to quit our want with glory, and conclude"
300,17,279,"The Greeks in sea - bords and our seas, to slack it, and extrude"
300,17,280,"His offer’d bounty by our flight. Fool that thou art, bewray"
300,17,281,"This counsel to no common ear, for no man shall obey;"
300,17,282,"If any will, I’ll check his will. But what our self command,"
300,17,283,"Let all observe. Take suppers all, keep watch of ev’ry hand."
300,17,284,"If any Trojan have some spoil, that takes his too much care,"
300,17,285,Make him dispose it publicly; ’tis better any fare
300,17,286,"The better for him, than the Greeks. When light then decks the skies,"
300,17,287,"Let all arm for a fierce assault. If great Achilles rise,"
300,17,288,"And will enforce our greater toil, it may rise so to him."
300,17,289,"On my back he shall find no wings, my spirit shall force my limb"
300,17,290,"To stand his worst, and give or take. Mars is our common lord,"
300,17,291,And the desirous swordsman’s life he ever puts to sword.”
300,17,292,"This counsel gat applause of all, so much were all unwise;"
300,17,293,"Minerva robb’d them of their brains, to like the ill advice"
300,17,294,"The great man gave, and leave the good since by the meaner given."
300,17,295,All took their suppers; but the Greeks spent all the heavy even
300,17,296,"About Patroclus’ mournful rites, Pelides leading all"
300,17,297,"In all the forms of heaviness. He by his side did fall,"
300,17,298,"And his man - slaught’ring hands impos’d into his oft - kiss’d breast,"
300,17,299,"Sighs blew up sighs; and lion - like, grac’d with a goodly crest,"
300,17,300,"That in his absence being robb’d by hunters of his whelps,"
300,17,301,"Returns to his so desolate den, and, for his wanted helps,"
300,17,302,"Beholding his unlook’d - for wants, flies roaring back again,"
300,17,303,"Hunts the sly hunter, many a vale resounding his disdain;"
300,17,304,"So mourn’d Pelides his late loss, so weighty were his moans,"
300,17,305,"Which, for their dumb sounds, now gave words to all his Myrmidons:"
300,17,306,"“O Gods,” said he, “how vain a vow I made, to cheer the mind"
300,17,307,"Of sad Menœtius, when his son his hand to mine resign’d,"
300,17,308,"That high - tow’r’d Opus he should see, and leave ras’d Ilion"
300,17,309,"With spoil and honour, ev’n with me! But Jove vouchsafes to none"
300,17,310,Wish’d passages to all his vows; we both were destinate
300,17,311,To bloody one earth here in Troy; nor any more estate
300,17,312,In my return hath Peleüs or Thetis; but because
300,17,313,"I last must undergo the ground, I’ll keep no fun’ral laws,"
300,17,314,"O my Patroclus, for thy corse, before I hither bring"
300,17,315,The arms of Hector and his head to thee for offering.
300,17,316,"Twelve youths, the most renown’d of Troy, I’ll sacrifice beside,"
300,17,317,"Before thy heap of funeral, to thee unpacified."
300,17,318,"In mean time, by our crooked sterns lie, drawing tears from me,"
300,17,319,"And round about thy honour’d corse, these dames of Dardanie,"
300,17,320,"And Ilion, with the ample breasts (whom our long spears and pow’rs"
300,17,321,"And labours purchas’d from the rich and by - us - ruin’d tow’rs,"
300,17,322,And cities strong and populous with divers - languag’d men)
300,17,323,"Shall kneel, and neither day nor night be licens’d to abstain"
300,17,324,"From solemn watches, their toil’d eyes held ope with endless tears.”"
300,17,325,"This passion past, he gave command to his near soldiers"
300,17,326,"To put a tripod to the fire, to cleanse the fester’d gore"
300,17,327,"From off the person. They obey’d, and presently did pour"
300,17,328,"Fresh water in it, kindled wood, and with an instant flame"
300,17,329,"The belly of the tripod girt, till fire’s hot quality came"
300,17,330,"Up to the water. Then they wash’d, and fill’d the mortal wound"
300,17,331,With wealthy oil of nine years old; then wrapp’d the body round
300,17,332,"In largeness of a fine white sheet, and put it then in bed;"
300,17,333,"When all watch’d all night with their lord, and spent sighs on the"
300,17,334,dead.
300,17,335,"Then Jove ask’d Juno: “If at length she had sufficed her spleen,"
300,17,336,Achilles being won to arms? Or if she had not been
300,17,337,"The natural mother of the Greeks, she did so still prefer"
300,17,338,"Their quarrel?” She, incens’d, ask’d: “Why he still was taunting her,"
300,17,339,For doing good to those she lov’d? since man to man might show
300,17,340,"Kind offices, though thrall to death, and though they did not know"
300,17,341,"Half such deep counsels as disclos’d beneath her far - seeing state,"
300,17,342,"She, reigning queen of Goddesses, and being in generate"
300,17,343,"Of one stock with himself, besides the state of being his wife"
300,17,344,"And must her wrath, and ill to Troy, continue such a strife"
300,17,345,From time to time ’twixt him and her?” This private speech they had.
300,17,346,And now the Silver - footed Queen had her ascension made
300,17,347,"To that incorruptible house, that starry golden court"
300,17,348,"Of fi’ry Vulcan, beautiful amongst th’ immortal sort,"
300,17,349,Which yet the lame God built himself. She found him in a sweat
300,17,350,"About his bellows, and in haste had twenty tripods beat."
300,17,351,"To set for stools about the sides of his well - builded hall,"
300,17,352,"To whose feet little wheels of gold he put, to go withal,"
300,17,353,"And enter his rich dining room, alone, their motion free,"
300,17,354,"And back again go out alone, miraculous to see."
300,17,355,"And thus much he had done of them, yet handles were to add,"
300,17,356,For which he now was making studs. And while their fashion had
300,17,357,"Employment of his skilful hand, bright Thetis was come near;"
300,17,358,"Whom first fair well - hair’d Charis saw, that was the nuptial fere"
300,17,359,"Of famous Vulcan, who the hand of Thetis took, and said:"
300,17,360,"“Why, fair - train’d, lov’d, and honour’d dame, are we thus visited"
300,17,361,"By your kind presence? You, I think, were never here before."
300,17,362,"Come near, that I may banquet you, and make you visit more.”"
300,17,363,"She led her in, and in a chair of silver (being the fruit"
300,17,364,"Of Vulcan’s hand) she made her sit, a footstool of a suit"
300,17,365,"Apposing to her crystal feet; and call’d the God of fire,"
300,17,366,"For Thetis was arriv’d, she said, and entertain’d desire"
300,17,367,"Of some grace that his art might grant. “Thetis to me,” said he,"
300,17,368,"“Is mighty, and most reverend, as one that nourish’d me,"
300,17,369,"When grief consum’d me, being cast from heaven by want of shame"
300,17,370,"In my proud mother, who, because she brought me forth so lame,"
300,17,371,"Would have me made away; and then, had I been much distress’d"
300,17,372,Had Thetis and Eurynome in either’s silver breast
300,17,373,Not rescu’d me; Eurynome that to her father had
300,17,374,Reciprocal Oceanus. Nine years with them I made
300,17,375,"A number of well - arted things, round bracelets, buttons brave,"
300,17,376,"Whistles, and carquenets. My forge stood in a hollow cave,"
300,17,377,"About which, murmuring with foam, th’ unmeasur’d ocean"
300,17,378,"Was ever beating; my abode known nor to God nor man,"
300,17,379,"But Thetis and Eurynome, and they would see me still,"
300,17,380,"They were my loving guardians. Now then the starry hill,"
300,17,381,"And our particular roof, thus grac’d with bright - hair’d Thetis here,"
300,17,382,"It fits me always to repay, a recompense as dear"
300,17,383,"To her thoughts, as my life to me. Haste, Charis, and appose"
300,17,384,"Some dainty guest - rites to our friend, while I my bellows loose"
300,17,385,"From fire, and lay up all my tools.” Then from an anvil rose"
300,17,386,"Th’ unwieldy monster, halt’d down, and all awry he went."
300,17,387,"He took his bellows from the fire, and ev’ry instrument"
300,17,388,Lock’d safe up in a silver chest. Then with a sponge he drest
300,17,389,"His face all over, neck and hands, and all his hairy breast;"
300,17,390,"Put on his coat, his sceptre took, and then went halting forth,"
300,17,391,"Handmaids of gold attending him, resembling in all worth"
300,17,392,"Living young damsels, fill’d with minds and wisdom, and were train’d"
300,17,393,"In all immortal ministry, virtue and voice contain’d,"
300,17,394,And mov’d with voluntary pow’rs; and these still wait’d on
300,17,395,"Their fi’ry sov’reign, who (not apt to walk) sate near the throne"
300,17,396,"Of fair - hair’d Thetis, took her hand, and thus he court’d her:"
300,17,397,"“For what affair, O fair - train’d queen, rev’rend to me, and dear,"
300,17,398,"Is our court honour’d with thy state, that hast not heretofore"
300,17,399,"Perform’d this kindness? Speak thy thoughts, thy suit can be no more"
300,17,400,Than my mind gives me charge to grant. Can my pow’r get it wrought?
300,17,401,Or that it have not only pow’r of only act in thought?”
300,17,402,"She thus: “O Vulcan, is there one, of all that are of heav’n,"
300,17,403,That in her never - quiet mind Saturnius hath giv’n
300,17,404,"So much affliction as to me: whom only he subjects,"
300,17,405,"Of all the sea - nymphs, to a man; and makes me bear th’ affects"
300,17,406,Of his frail bed; and all against the freedom of my will;
300,17,407,And he worn to his root with age? From him another ill
300,17,408,"Ariseth to me; Jupiter, you know, hath giv’n a son,"
300,17,409,"The excellent’st of men, to me; whose education"
300,17,410,"On my part well hath answered his own worth, having grown"
300,17,411,"As in a fruitful soil a tree, that puts not up alone"
300,17,412,"His body to a naked height, but jointly gives his growth"
300,17,413,"A thousand branches; yet to him so short a life I brought,"
300,17,414,That never I shall see him more return’d to Peleus’ court.
300,17,415,And all that short life he hath spent in most unhappy sort;
300,17,416,"For first he won a lovely dame, and had her by the hands"
300,17,417,"Of all the Grecians, yet this dame Atrides countermands;"
300,17,418,"For which in much disdain he mourn’d, and almost pin’d away."
300,17,419,"And yet for this wrong he receiv’d some honour, I must say;"
300,17,420,"The Greeks, being shut up at their ships, not suffer’d to advance"
300,17,421,A head out of their batter’d sterns; and mighty suppliance
300,17,422,"By all their grave men hath been made, gifts, honours, all propos’d"
300,17,423,"For his reflection; yet he still kept close, and saw enclos’d"
300,17,424,Their whole host in this gen’ral plague. But now his friend put on
300,17,425,"His arms, being sent by him to field, and many a Myrmidon"
300,17,426,"In conduct of him. All the day, they fought before the gates"
300,17,427,"Of Scæa, and, most certainly, that day had seen the dates"
300,17,428,"Of all Troy’s honours in her dust, if Phœbus (having done"
300,17,429,Much mischief more) the envied life of good Menœtius’ son
300,17,430,"Had not with partial hands enforc’d, and all the honour giv’n"
300,17,431,"To Hector, who hath pris’d his arms. And therefore I am driv’n"
300,17,432,T’ embrace thy knees for new defence to my lov’d son. Alas!
300,17,433,"His life, prefix’d so short a date, had need spent that with grace."
300,17,434,"A shield then for him, and a helm, fair greaves, and curets, such"
300,17,435,"As may renown thy workmanship, and honour him as much,"
300,17,436,"I sue for at thy famous hands.” “Be confident,” said he,"
300,17,437,“Let these wants breed thy thoughts no care. I would it lay in me
300,17,438,"To hide him from his heavy death, when fate shall seek for him,"
300,17,439,As well as with renownéd arms to fit his goodly limb;
300,17,440,"Which thy hands shall convey to him; and all eyes shall admire,"
300,17,441,"See, and desire again to see, thy satisfied desire.”"
300,17,442,"This said, he left her there, and forth did to his bellows go,"
300,17,443,"Appos’d them to the fire again, commanding them to blow."
300,17,444,"Through twenty holes made to his hearth at once blew twenty pair,"
300,17,445,"That fir’d his coals, sometimes with soft, sometimes with vehement,"
300,17,446,"air,"
300,17,447,"As he will’d, and his work requir’d. Amids the flame he cast"
300,17,448,"Tin, silver, precious gold, and brass; and in a stock he plac’d"
300,17,449,"A mighty anvil; his right hand a weighty hammer held,"
300,17,450,His left his tongs. And first he forg’d a strong and spacious shield
300,17,451,Adorn’d with twenty sev’ral hues; about whose verge he beat
300,17,452,"A ring, three - fold and radiant, and on the back he set"
300,17,453,A silver handle; five - fold were the equal lines he drew
300,17,454,"About the whole circumference, in which his hand did shew"
300,17,455,(Directed with a knowing mind) a rare variety;
300,17,456,For in it he presented Earth; in it the Sea and Sky;
300,17,457,"In it the never - wearied Sun, the Moon exactly round,"
300,17,458,"And all those Stars with which the brows of ample heav’n are crown’d,"
300,17,459,"Orion, all the Pleiades, and those sev’n Atlas got,"
300,17,460,"The close - beam’d Hyades, the Bear, surnam’d the Chariot,"
300,17,461,"That turns about heav’n’s axle - tree, holds ope a constant eye"
300,17,462,"Upon Orion, and, of all the cressets in the sky,"
300,17,463,His golden forehead never bows to th’ Ocean empery.
300,17,464,"Two cities in the spacious shield he built, with goodly state"
300,17,465,"Of divers - languag’d men. The one did nuptials celebrate,"
300,17,466,"Observing at them solemn feasts, the brides from forth their bow’rs"
300,17,467,"With torches usher’d through the streets, a world of paramours"
300,17,468,"Excited by them; youths and maids in lovely circles danc’d,"
300,17,469,"To whom the merry pipe and harp their spritely sounds advanc’d,"
300,17,470,The matrons standing in their doors admiring. Other where
300,17,471,"A solemn court of law was kept, where throngs of people were."
300,17,472,"The case in question was a fine, impos’d on one that slew"
300,17,473,"The friend of him that follow’d it, and for the fine did sue;"
300,17,474,"Which th’ other pleaded he had paid. The adverse part denied,"
300,17,475,And openly affirm’d he had no penny satisfied.
300,17,476,Both put it to arbitrement. The people cried ’twas best
300,17,477,"For both parts, and th’ assistants too gave their dooms like the rest."
300,17,478,The heralds made the people peace. The seniors then did bear
300,17,479,"The voiceful heralds’ sceptres, sat within a sacred sphere,"
300,17,480,"On polish’d stones, and gave by turns their sentence. In the court"
300,17,481,"Two talents’ gold were cast, for him that judg’d in justest sort."
300,17,482,The other city other wars employ’d as busily;
300,17,483,"Two armies glittering in arms, of one confed’racy,"
300,17,484,Besieg’d it; and a parlè had with those within the town.
300,17,485,"Two ways they stood resolv’d; to see the city overthrown,"
300,17,486,"Or that the citizens should heap in two parts all their wealth,"
300,17,487,"And give them half. They neither lik’d, but arm’d themselves by"
300,17,488,"stealth,"
300,17,489,"Left all their old men, wives, and boys, behind to man their walls,"
300,17,490,"And stole out to their enemy’s town. The Queen of martials,"
300,17,491,"And Mars himself, conducted them; both which, being forg’d of gold,"
300,17,492,"Must needs have golden furniture, and men might so behold"
300,17,493,"They were presented Deities. The people, Vulcan forg’d"
300,17,494,"Of meaner metal. When they came, where that was to be urg’d"
300,17,495,"For which they went, within a vale close to a flood, whose stream"
300,17,496,"Us’d to give all their cattle drink, they there enambush’d them,"
300,17,497,"And sent two scouts out to descry, when th’ enemy’s herds and sheep"
300,17,498,"Were setting out. They straight came forth, with two that us’d to keep"
300,17,499,"Their passage always; both which pip’d, and went on merrily,"
300,17,500,"Nor dream’d of ambuscadoes there. The ambush then let fly,"
300,17,501,"Slew all their white - fleec’d sheep, and neat, and by them laid their"
300,17,502,guard.
300,17,503,"When those in siege before the town so strange an uproar heard,"
300,17,504,"Behind, amongst their flocks and herds (being then in council set)"
300,17,505,"They then start up, took horse, and soon their subtle enemy met,"
300,17,506,"Fought with them on the river’s shore, where both gave mutual blows"
300,17,507,"With well - pil’d darts. Amongst them all perverse Contention rose,"
300,17,508,"Amongst them Tumult was enrag’d, amongst them ruinous Fate"
300,17,509,"Had her red - finger; some they took in an unhurt estate,"
300,17,510,"Some hurt yet living, some quite slain, and those they tugg’d to them"
300,17,511,"By both the feet, stripp’d off and took their weeds, with all the"
300,17,512,stream
300,17,513,Of blood upon them that their steels had manfully let out.
300,17,514,They far’d as men alive indeed drew dead indeed about.
300,17,515,"To these the fi’ry Artizan did add a new - ear’d field,"
300,17,516,"Large and thrice plough’d, the soil being soft, and of a wealthy yield;"
300,17,517,"And many men at plough he made, that drave earth here and there,"
300,17,518,"And turn’d up stitches orderly; at whose end when they were,"
300,17,519,A fellow ever gave their hands full cups of luscious wine;
300,17,520,"Which emptied, for another stitch, the earth they undermine,"
300,17,521,And long till th’ utmost bound be reach’d of all the ample close.
300,17,522,"The soil turn’d up behind the plough, all black like earth arose,"
300,17,523,"Though forg’d of nothing else but gold, and lay in show as light"
300,17,524,"As if it had been plough’d indeed, miraculous to sight."
300,17,525,"There grew by this a field of corn, high, ripe, where reapers wrought,"
300,17,526,"And let thick handfuls fall to earth, for which some bought"
300,17,527,"Bands, and made sheaves. Three binders stood, and took the handfuls"
300,17,528,reap’d
300,17,529,"From boys that gather’d quickly up, and by them armfuls heap’d."
300,17,530,"Amongst these at furrow’s end, the king stood pleas’d at heart,"
300,17,531,"Said no word, but his sceptre show’d. And from him, much apart,"
300,17,532,His harvest - bailiffs underneath an oak a feast prepar’d
300,17,533,"And having kill’d a mighty ox, stood there to see him shar’d"
300,17,534,"Which women for their harvest folks (then come to sup) had dress’d,"
300,17,535,"And many white wheat - cakes bestow’d, to make it up a feast."
300,17,536,"He set near this a vine of gold, that crack’d beneath the weight"
300,17,537,"Of bunches black with being ripe; to keep which at the height,"
300,17,538,"A silver rail ran all along, and round about it flow’d"
300,17,539,"An azure moat, and to this guard, a quickset was bestow’d"
300,17,540,"Of tin, one only path to all, by which the pressmen came"
300,17,541,"In time of vintage. Youths and maids, that bore not yet the flame"
300,17,542,"Of manly Hymen, baskets bore, of grapes and mellow fruit."
300,17,543,"A lad that sweetly touch’d a harp, to which his voice did suit,"
300,17,544,"Center’d the circles of that youth, all whose skill could not do"
300,17,545,"The wanton’s pleasure to their minds, that danc’d, sung, whistled too."
300,17,546,"A herd of oxen then he carv’d, with high rais’d heads, forg’d all"
300,17,547,"Of gold and tin, for colour mix’d, and bellowing from their stall"
300,17,548,"Rush’d to their pastures at a flood, that echo’d all their throats,"
300,17,549,"Exceeding swift, and full of reeds; and all in yellow coats"
300,17,550,"Four herdsmen follow’d; after whom, nine mastiffs went. In head"
300,17,551,"Of all the herd, upon a bull, that deadly bellowéd,"
300,17,552,"Two horrid lions rampt, and seiz’d, and tugg’d off bellowing still;"
300,17,553,"Both men and dogs came; yet they tore the hide, and lapp’d their fill"
300,17,554,"Of black blood, and the entrails ate. In vain the men assay’d"
300,17,555,"To set their dogs on; none durst pinch, but cur - like stood and bay’d"
300,17,556,"In both the faces of their kings, and all their onsets fled."
300,17,557,"Then in a passing pleasant vale, the famous Artsman fed,"
300,17,558,"Upon a goodly pasture ground, rich flocks of white - fleec’d sheep,"
300,17,559,"Built stables, cottages, and cotes, that did the shepherds keep"
300,17,560,"From wind and weather. Next to these, he cut a dancing place,"
300,17,561,"All full of turnings, that was like the admirable maze"
300,17,562,"For fair - hair’d Ariadne made, by cunning Dædalus;"
300,17,563,"And in it youths and virgins danc’d, all young and beauteous,"
300,17,564,And glewéd in another’s palms. Weeds that the wind did toss
300,17,565,"The virgins wore; the youths wov’n coats, that cast a faint dim gloss"
300,17,566,"Like that of oil. Fresh garlands too, the virgins’ temples crown’d;"
300,17,567,"The youths gilt swords wore at their thighs, with silver bawdrics"
300,17,568,bound.
300,17,569,"Sometimes all wound close in a ring, to which as fast they spun"
300,17,570,"As any wheel a turner makes, being tried how it will run,"
300,17,571,"While he is set; and out again, as full of speed they wound,"
300,17,572,"Not one left fast, or breaking hands. A multitude stood round,"
300,17,573,"Delighted with their nimble sport; to end which two begun,"
300,17,574,"Mids all, a song, and turning sung the sports conclusión,"
300,17,575,"All this he circled in the shield, with pouring round about,"
300,17,576,"In all his rage, the Ocean, that it might never out."
300,17,577,"This shield thus done, he forg’d for him, such curets as outshin’d"
300,17,578,The blaze of fire. A helmet then (through which no steel could find
300,17,579,"Forc’d passage) he compos’d, whose hue a hundred colours took,"
300,17,580,"And in the crest a plume of gold, that each breath stirr’d, he stuck."
300,17,581,"All done, he all to Thetis brought, and held all up to her."
300,17,582,"She took them all, and like t’ the hawk, surnam’d the osspringer,"
300,17,583,"From Vulcan to her mighty son, with that so glorious show,"
300,17,584,"Stoop’d from the steep Olympian hill, hid in eternal snow."
300,17,585,THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK.
300,18,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,18,2,"Thetis presenting armour to her son,"
300,18,3,"He calls a court, with full reflection"
300,18,4,Of all his wrath; takes of the king of men
300,18,5,Free - offer’d gifts. All take their breakfast then;
300,18,6,"He only fasting, arms, and brings abroad"
300,18,7,"The Grecian host, and (hearing the abode"
300,18,8,Of his near death by Xanthus prophesied)
300,18,9,"The horse, for his so bold presage, doth chide."
300,18,10,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,18,11,"Ταυ̑ gives the anger period,"
300,18,12,And great Achilles comes abroad.
300,18,13,"The morn arose, and from the ocean, in her saffron robe,"
300,18,14,"Gave light to all, as well to Gods, as men of th’ under globe."
300,18,15,"Thetis stoop’d home, and found the prostrate person of her son"
300,18,16,"About his friend, still pouring out himself in passión;"
300,18,17,A number more being heavy consorts to him in his cares.
300,18,18,"Amongst them all Thetis appear’d and, sacred comforters,"
300,18,19,"Made these short words: “Though we must grieve, yet bear it thus, my"
300,18,20,"son,"
300,18,21,"It was no man that prostrated, in this sad fashión,"
300,18,22,"Thy dearest friend; it was a God that first laid on his hand,"
300,18,23,"Whose will is law. The Gods’ decrees, no human must withstand."
300,18,24,"Do thou embrace this fabric of a God, whose hand before"
300,18,25,"Ne’er forg’d the like; and such as yet, no human shoulder wore.”"
300,18,26,"Thus, setting down, the precious metal of the arms was such"
300,18,27,That all the room rung with the weight of every slend’rest touch.
300,18,28,"Cold tremblings took the Myrmidons; none durst sustain, all fear’d"
300,18,29,"T’ oppose their eyes; Achilles yet, as soon as they appear’d,"
300,18,30,"Stern Anger enter’d. From his eyes, as if the day - star rose,"
300,18,31,A radiance terrifying men did all the state enclose.
300,18,32,"At length he took into his hands the rich gift of the God,"
300,18,33,"And, much pleas’d to behold the art that in the shield he show’d,"
300,18,34,"He brake forth into this applause: “O mother, these right well"
300,18,35,Show an immortal finger’s touch; man’s hand must never deal
300,18,36,"With arms again. Now I will arm; yet, that no honour make"
300,18,37,"My friend forgotten, I much fear, lest with the blows of flies"
300,18,38,"His brass - inflicted wounds are fil’d; life gone, his person lies"
300,18,39,All apt to putrefactión.” She bade him doubt no harm
300,18,40,"Of those offences, she would care, to keep the petulant swarm"
300,18,41,"Of flies, that usually taint the bodies of the slain,"
300,18,42,"From his friend’s person. Though a year, the earth’s top should sustain"
300,18,43,"His slaughter’d body, it should still rest sound, and rather hold"
300,18,44,"A better state than worse, since time that death first made him cold."
300,18,45,"And so bade call a council, to dispose of new alarms,"
300,18,46,"Where, to the king, that was the pastor of that flock in arms,"
300,18,47,"He should depose all anger, and put on a fortitude"
300,18,48,Fit for his arms. All this his pow’rs with dreadful strength indued.
300,18,49,"She, with her fair hand, still’d into the nostrils of his friend"
300,18,50,Red nectar and ambrosia; with which she did defend
300,18,51,"The corse from putrefactión. He trod along the shore,"
300,18,52,"And summon’d all th’ heroic Greeks, with all that spent before"
300,18,53,"The time in exercise with him, the masters, pilots too,"
300,18,54,"Vict’lers, and all. All, when they saw Achilles summon so,"
300,18,55,"Swarm’d to the council, having long left the laborious wars."
300,18,56,"To all these came two halting kings, true servitors of Mars,"
300,18,57,"Tydides and wise Ithacus, both leaning on their spears,"
300,18,58,Their wounds still painful; and both these sat first of all the peers.
300,18,59,"The last come was the king of men, sore wounded with the lance"
300,18,60,"Of Coon Antenorides. All set, the first in utterance"
300,18,61,"Was Thetis’ son, who rose and said: “Atrides, had not this"
300,18,62,"Conferr’d most profit to us both, when both our enmities"
300,18,63,"Consum’d us so, and for a wench, whom, when I choos’d for prise,"
300,18,64,"In laying Lyrnessus’ ruin’d walls amongst our victories,"
300,18,65,"I would to heav’n, as first she set her dainty foot aboard,"
300,18,66,"Diana’s hand had tumbled off, and with a jav’lin gor’d!"
300,18,67,"For then th’ unmeasurable earth had not so thick been gnawn,"
300,18,68,"In death’s convulsions, by our friends, since my affects were drawn"
300,18,69,"To such distemper. To our foe, and to our foe’s chief friend,"
300,18,70,Our jar brought profit; but the Greeks will never give an end
300,18,71,To thought of what it prejudic’d them. Past things yet past our aid;
300,18,72,"Fit grief for what wrath rul’d in them, must make th’ amends repaid"
300,18,73,"With that necessity of love, that now forbids our ire;"
300,18,74,Which I with free affects obey. ’Tis for the senseless fire
300,18,75,"Still to be burning, having stuff; but men must curb rage still,"
300,18,76,"Being fram’d with voluntary pow’rs, as well to check the will"
300,18,77,"As give it reins. Give you then charge, that for our instant fight"
300,18,78,"The Greeks may follow me to field, to try if still the night"
300,18,79,"Will bear out Trojans at our ships. I hope there is some one,"
300,18,80,"Amongst their chief encouragers, will thank me to be gone,"
300,18,81,And bring his heart down to his knees in that submissión.”
300,18,82,The Greeks rejoic’d to hear the heart of Peleus’ mighty son
300,18,83,So qualified. And then the king (not rising from his throne
300,18,84,"For his late hurt) to get good ear, thus order’d his reply:"
300,18,85,"“Princes of Greece, your states shall suffer no indignity,"
300,18,86,"If, being far off, ye stand and hear; nor fits it such as stand"
300,18,87,"At greater distance, to disturb the council now in hand"
300,18,88,"By uproar, in their too much care of hearing. Some, of force,"
300,18,89,"Must lose some words; for hard it is, in such a great concourse"
300,18,90,(Though hearers’ ears be ne’er so sharp) to touch at all things spoke;
300,18,91,"And in assemblies of such thrust, how can a man provoke"
300,18,92,"Fit pow’r to hear, or leave to speak? Best auditors may there"
300,18,93,"Lose fittest words, and the most vocal orator fit ear."
300,18,94,"My main end then, to satisfy Pelides with reply,"
300,18,95,My words shall prosecute; to him my speech especially
300,18,96,"Shall bear direction. Yet I wish, the court in general"
300,18,97,Would give fit ear; my speech shall need attentión of all.
300,18,98,Oft have our peers of Greece much blam’d my forcing of the prise
300,18,99,"Due to Achilles; of which act, not I, but destinies,"
300,18,100,"And Jove himself, and black Erinnys (that casts false mists still"
300,18,101,"Betwixt us and our actions done, both by her pow’r and will)"
300,18,102,Are authors. What could I do then? The very day and hour
300,18,103,"Of our debate, that Fury stole in that act on my pow’r."
300,18,104,"And more; all things are done by strife; that ancient seed of Jove,"
300,18,105,"Ate, that hurts all, perfects all, her feet are soft, and move"
300,18,106,"Not on the earth, they bear her still aloft men’s heads, and there"
300,18,107,"The harmful hurts them. Nor was I alone her prisoner,"
300,18,108,"Jove, best of men and Gods, hath been; not he himself hath gone"
300,18,109,"Beyond her fetters, no, she made a woman put them on;"
300,18,110,For when Alcmena was to vent the force of Hercules
300,18,111,"In well - wall’d Thebes, thus Jove triumph’d: ‘Hear, Gods and Goddesses,"
300,18,112,"The words my joys urg’d: In this day, Lucina, bringing pain"
300,18,113,"To labouring women, shall produce into the light of men"
300,18,114,"A man that all his neighbour kings shall in his empire hold,"
300,18,115,And vaunt that more than manly race whose honour’d veins enfold
300,18,116,"My eminent blood.’ Saturnia conceiv’d a present sleight,"
300,18,117,And urg’d confirmance of his vaunt t’ infringe it; her conceit
300,18,118,In this sort urg’d: ‘Thou wilt not hold thy word with this rare man;
300,18,119,"Or, if thou wilt, confirm it with the oath Olympian,"
300,18,120,"That whosoever falls this day betwixt a woman’s knees,"
300,18,121,"Of those men’s stocks that from thy blood derive their pedigrees,"
300,18,122,"Shall all his neighbour towns command.’ Jove, ignorant of fraud,"
300,18,123,"Took that great oath, which his great ill gave little cause t’"
300,18,124,applaud.
300,18,125,"Down from Olympus’ top she stoop’d, and quickly reach’d the place"
300,18,126,"In Argos where the famous wife of Sthenelus, whose race"
300,18,127,"He fetch’d from Jove by Perseus, dwelt. She was but sev’n months gone"
300,18,128,"With issue, yet she brought it forth; Alcmena’s matchless son"
300,18,129,"Delay’d from light, Saturnia repress’d the teeming throes"
300,18,130,"Of his great mother. Up to heav’n she mounts again, and shows,"
300,18,131,"In glory, her deceit to Jove. ‘Bright - light’ning Jove,’ said she,"
300,18,132,‘Now th’ Argives have an emperor; a son deriv’d from thee
300,18,133,"Is born to Persean Sthenelus, Eurystheus his name,"
300,18,134,Noble and worthy of the rule thou swor’st to him.’ This came
300,18,135,"Close to the heart of Jupiter; and Ate, that had wrought"
300,18,136,"This anger by Saturnia, by her bright hair he caught,"
300,18,137,"Held down her head, and over her made this infallible vow:"
300,18,138,"‘That never to the cope of stars should reascend that brow,"
300,18,139,"Being so infortunate to all.’ Thus, swinging her about,"
300,18,140,He cast her from the fi’ry heav’n; who ever since thrust out
300,18,141,"Her fork’d sting in th’ affairs of men. Jove ever since did grieve,"
300,18,142,Since his dear issue Hercules did by his vow achieve
300,18,143,"The unjust toils of Eurystheus. Thus fares it now with me,"
300,18,144,Since under Hector’s violence the Grecian progeny
300,18,145,Fell so unfitly by my spleen; whose falls will ever stick
300,18,146,In my griev’d thoughts: my weakness yet (Saturnius making sick
300,18,147,"The state my mind held) now recur’d, th’ amends shall make ev’n weight"
300,18,148,With my offence. And therefore rouse thy spirits to the fight
300,18,149,"With all thy forces; all the gifts, propos’d thee at thy tent"
300,18,150,"Last day by royal Ithacus, my officers shall present."
300,18,151,"And, if it like thee, strike no stroke, though never so on thorns"
300,18,152,"Thy mind stands to thy friend’s revenge, till my command adorns"
300,18,153,"Thy tents and coffers with such gifts, as well may let thee know"
300,18,154,"How much I wish thee satisfied.” He answer’d: “Let thy vow,"
300,18,155,"Renown’d Atrides, at thy will be kept, as justice would,"
300,18,156,Or keep thy gifts; ’tis all in thee. The council now we hold
300,18,157,Is for repairing our main field with all our fortitude.
300,18,158,"My fair show made brooks no retreat, nor must delays delude"
300,18,159,Our deed’s expectance. Yet undone the great work is. All eyes
300,18,160,"Must see Achilles in first fight depeopling enemies,"
300,18,161,As well as counsel it in court; that ev’ry man set on
300,18,162,May choose his man to imitate my exercise upon.”
300,18,163,"Ulysses answer’d: “Do not yet, thou man made like the Gods,"
300,18,164,"Take fasting men to field. Suppose, that whatsoever odds"
300,18,165,"It brings against them with full men, thy boundless eminence"
300,18,166,"Can amply answer, yet refrain to tempt a violence."
300,18,167,"The conflict wearing out our men was late, and held as long,"
300,18,168,"Wherein, though most Jove stood for Troy, he yet made our part strong"
300,18,169,"To bear that most. But ’twas to bear, and that breeds little heart."
300,18,170,"Let wine and bread then add to it; they help the twofold part,"
300,18,171,"The soul and body, in a man, both force and fortitude."
300,18,172,"All day men cannot fight and fast, though never so indued"
300,18,173,"With minds to fight, for, that suppos’d, there lurks yet secretly"
300,18,174,"Thirst, hunger, in th’ oppresséd joints, which no mind can supply."
300,18,175,"They take away a marcher’s knees. Men’s bodies throughly fed,"
300,18,176,"Their minds share with them in their strength; and, all day combated,"
300,18,177,"One stirs not, till you call off all. Dismiss them then to meat,"
300,18,178,"And let Atrides tender here, in sight of all this seat,"
300,18,179,"The gifts he promis’d. Let him swear before us all, and rise"
300,18,180,"To that oath, that he never touch’d in any wanton wise"
300,18,181,"The lady he enforc’d. Besides, that he remains in mind"
300,18,182,"As chastely satisfied; not touch’d, or privily inclin’d"
300,18,183,"With future vantages. And last, ’tis fit he should approve"
300,18,184,"All these rites at a solemn feast in honour of your love,"
300,18,185,That so you take no mangled law for merits absolute.
300,18,186,"And thus the honours you receive, resolving the pursuit"
300,18,187,"Of your friend’s quarrel, well will quit your sorrow for your friend."
300,18,188,"And thou, Atrides, in the taste of so severe an end,"
300,18,189,Hereafter may on others hold a juster government;
300,18,190,"Nor will it aught impair a king, to give a sound content"
300,18,191,"To any subject soundly wrong’d.” “I joy,” replied the king,"
300,18,192,"“O Laertiades, to hear thy lib’ral counselling;"
300,18,193,"In which is all decorum kept, nor any point lacks touch"
300,18,194,That might be thought on to conclude a reconcilement such
300,18,195,"As fits example, and us two. My mind yet makes me swear,"
300,18,196,"Not your impulsion; and that mind shall rest so kind and clear,"
300,18,197,"That I will not forswear to God. Let then Achilles stay,"
300,18,198,"Though never so inflam’d for fight, and all men here I pray"
300,18,199,"To stay, till from my tents these gifts be brought here, and the truce"
300,18,200,"At all parts finish’d before all. And thou of all I choose,"
300,18,201,"Divine Ulysses, and command to choose of all your host"
300,18,202,"Youths of most honour, to present, to him we honour most,"
300,18,203,"The gifts we late vow’d, and the dames. Mean space about our tents"
300,18,204,"Talthybius shall provide a boar, to crown these kind events"
300,18,205,"With thankful sacrifice to Jove, and to the God of Light.”"
300,18,206,"Achilles answer’d: “These affairs will show more requisite,"
300,18,207,"Great king of men, some other time, when our more free estates"
300,18,208,"Yield fit cessation from the war, and when my spleen abates;"
300,18,209,"But now, to all our shames besides, our friends by Hector slain"
300,18,210,"(And Jove to friend) lie unfetch’d off. Haste, then, and meat your men;"
300,18,211,"Though, I must still say, my command would lead them fasting forth,"
300,18,212,"And all together feast at night. Meat will be something worth,"
300,18,213,"When stomachs first have made it way with venting infamy,"
300,18,214,"And other sorrows late sustain’d, with long’d - for wreaks, that lie"
300,18,215,"Heavy upon them, for right’s sake. Before which load be got"
300,18,216,"From off my stomach, meat nor drink, I vow, shall down my throat,"
300,18,217,"My friend being dead, who digg’d with wounds, and bor’d through both"
300,18,218,"his feet,"
300,18,219,"Lies in the entry of my tent, and in the tears doth fleet"
300,18,220,Of his associates. Meat and drink have little merit then
300,18,221,"To comfort me; but blood, and death, and deadly groans of men.”"
300,18,222,The great in counsels yet made good his former counsels thus:
300,18,223,"“O Peleus’ son, of all the Greeks by much most valorous,"
300,18,224,Better and mightier than myself no little with thy lance
300,18,225,"I yield thy worth; in wisdom, yet, no less I dare advance"
300,18,226,"My right above thee, since above in years, and knowing more."
300,18,227,Let then thy mind rest in thy words. We quickly shall have store
300,18,228,"And all satiety of fight, whose steel heaps store of straw"
300,18,229,"And little corn upon a floor, when Jove, that doth withdraw"
300,18,230,"And join all battles, once begins t’ incline his balances,"
300,18,231,In which he weighs the lives of men. The Greeks you must not press
300,18,232,To mourning with the belly; death hath nought to do with that
300,18,233,"In healthful men that mourn for friends. His steel we stumble at,"
300,18,234,"And fall at, ev’ry day, you see, sufficient store, and fast."
300,18,235,"What hour is it that any breathes? We must not use; more haste,"
300,18,236,Than speed holds fit for our revenge. Nor should we mourn too much.
300,18,237,"Who dead is, must be buriéd. Men’s patience should be such,"
300,18,238,"That one day’s moan should serve one man. The dead must end with death,"
300,18,239,And life last with what strengthens life. All those that held their
300,18,240,breath
300,18,241,"From death in fight the more should eat, that so they may supply"
300,18,242,"Their fellows that have stuck in field, and fight incessantly."
300,18,243,"Let none expect reply to this, nor stay; for this shall stand"
300,18,244,"Or fall with some offence to him that looks for new command,"
300,18,245,"Whoever in dislike holds back. All join then, all things fit"
300,18,246,"Allow’d for all; set on a charge, at all parts answering it.”"
300,18,247,"This said, he chose, for noblest youths to bear the presents, these:"
300,18,248,"The sons of Nestor, and with them renown’d Meriones,"
300,18,249,"Phylides, Thoas, Lycomed, and Meges, all which went,"
300,18,250,"And Menalippus, following Ulysses to the tent"
300,18,251,"Of Agamemnon. He but spake, and with the word the deed"
300,18,252,Had join’d effect. The fitness well was answer’d in the speed.
300,18,253,"The presents, added to the dame the Gen’ral did enforce,"
300,18,254,"Were twenty caldrons, tripods sev’n, twelve young and goodly horse;"
300,18,255,"Sev’n ladies excellently seen in all Minerva’s skill,"
300,18,256,The eighth Briseis who had pow’r to ravish ev’ry will;
300,18,257,"Twelve talents of the finest gold, all which Ulysses weigh’d"
300,18,258,"And carried first; and after him, the other youths convey’d"
300,18,259,"The other presents, tender’d all in face of all the court."
300,18,260,"Up rose the king. Talthybius, whose voice had a report"
300,18,261,"Like to a God, call’d to the rites. There having brought the boar,"
300,18,262,"Atrides with his knife took say upon the part before,"
300,18,263,"And lifting up his sacred hands, to Jove to make his vows,"
300,18,264,"Grave silence strook the cómplete court; when, casting his high brows"
300,18,265,"Up to the broad heav’n, thus he spake: “Now witness, Jupiter,"
300,18,266,"First, highest, and thou best of Gods; thou Earth that all dost bear;"
300,18,267,Thou Sun; ye Furies under earth that ev’ry soul torment
300,18,268,Whom impious perjury distains; that nought incontinent
300,18,269,"In bed, or any other act to any slend’rest touch"
300,18,270,"Of my light vows, hath wrong’d the dame; and, let my plagues be such"
300,18,271,"As are inflicted by the Gods, in all extremity"
300,18,272,"Of whomsoever perjur’d men, if godless perjury"
300,18,273,"In least degree dishonour me.” This said, the bristled throat"
300,18,274,"Of the submitted sacrifice, with ruthless steel he cut;"
300,18,275,"Which straight into the hoary sea Talthybius cast, to feed"
300,18,276,The sea - born nation. Then stood up the half - celestial seed
300,18,277,"Of fair - hair’d Thetis, strength’ning thus Atrides’ innocence:"
300,18,278,"“O father Jupiter, from thee descends the confluence"
300,18,279,Of all man’s ill; for now I see the mighty king of men
300,18,280,"At no hand forc’d away my prise, nor first inflam’d my spleen"
300,18,281,"With any set ill in himself, but thou, the King of Gods,"
300,18,282,"Incens’d with Greece, made that the mean to all their periods."
300,18,283,"Which now amend we as we may, and give all suffrages"
300,18,284,"To what wise Ithacus advis’d; take breakfasts, and address"
300,18,285,"For instant conflict.” Thus he rais’d the court, and all took way"
300,18,286,To sev’ral ships. The Myrmidons the presents did convey
300,18,287,"T’ Achilles’ fleet, and in his tents dispos’d them; doing grace"
300,18,288,Of seat and all rights to the dames; the horses put in place
300,18,289,"With others of Æacides. When, like love’s golden Queen,"
300,18,290,"Briseis all in ghastly wounds had dead Patroclus seen,"
300,18,291,"She fell about him, shrieking out, and with her white hands tore"
300,18,292,"Her hair, breasts, radiant cheeks, and, drown’d in warm tears, did"
300,18,293,deplore
300,18,294,His cruel destiny. At length she gat pow’r to express
300,18,295,"Her violent passion, and thus spake this like - the - goddesses:"
300,18,296,"“O good Patroclus, to my life the dearest grace it had,"
300,18,297,"I, wretched dame, departing hence, enforc’d, and dying sad,"
300,18,298,"Left thee alive, when thou hadst cheer’d my poor captivity,"
300,18,299,And now return’d I find thee dead; misery on misery
300,18,300,Ever increasing with my steps. The lord to whom my sire
300,18,301,"And dearest mother gave my life in nuptials, his life’s fire"
300,18,302,I saw before our city gates extinguish’d: and his fate
300,18,303,"Three of my worthy brothers’ lives, in one womb generate,"
300,18,304,Felt all in that black day of death. And when Achilles’ hand
300,18,305,"Had slain all these, and ras’d the town Mynetes did command,"
300,18,306,(All cause of never - ending griefs presented) thou took’st all
300,18,307,"On thy endeavour to convert to joy as general,"
300,18,308,"Affirming, he that hurt should heal, and thou wouldst make thy friend,"
300,18,309,"Brave captain that thou wert, supply my vowéd husband’s end,"
300,18,310,"And in rich Phthia celebrate, amongst his Myrmidons,"
300,18,311,"Our nuptial banquets; for which grace, with these most worthy moans"
300,18,312,"I never shall be satiate, thou ever being kind,"
300,18,313,"Ever delightsome, one sweet grace fed still with one sweet mind.”"
300,18,314,"Thus spake she weeping; and with her, did th’ other ladies moan"
300,18,315,"Patroclus’ fortunes in pretext, but in sad truth their own."
300,18,316,"About Æacides himself the kings of Greece were plac’d,"
300,18,317,"Entreating him to food; and he entreated them as fast,"
300,18,318,"Still intermixing words and sighs, if any friend were there"
300,18,319,"Of all his dearest, they would cease, and offer him no cheer"
300,18,320,But his due sorrows; for before the sun had left that sky
300,18,321,"He would not eat, but of that day sustain th’ extremity."
300,18,322,"Thus all the kings, in res’lute grief and fasting, he dismiss’d;"
300,18,323,"But both th’ Atrides, Ithacus, and war’s old Martialist,"
300,18,324,"Idomenëus and his friend, and Phœnix, these remain’d"
300,18,325,"Endeavouring comfort, but no thought of his vow’d woe restrain’d."
300,18,326,"Nor could, till that day’s bloody fight had calm’d his blood; he still"
300,18,327,"Remember’d something of his friend, whose good was all his ill."
300,18,328,Their urging meat the diligent fashion of his friend renew’d
300,18,329,"In that excitement: “Thou,” said he, “when this speed was pursued"
300,18,330,"Against the Trojans, evermore apposedst in my tent"
300,18,331,"A pleasing breakfast; being so free, and sweetly diligent,"
300,18,332,Thou mad’st all meat sweet. Then the war was tearful to our foe
300,18,333,"But now to me; thy wounds so wound me, and thy overthrow;"
300,18,334,"For which my ready food I fly, and on thy longings feed."
300,18,335,Nothing could more afflict me; Fame relating the foul deed
300,18,336,"Of my dear father’s slaughter, blood drawn from my sole son’s heart,"
300,18,337,"No more could wound me. Curséd man, that in this foreign part"
300,18,338,"(For hateful Helen) my true love, my country, sire, and son,"
300,18,339,"I thus should part with. Scyros now gives educatión,[1]"
300,18,340,"O Neoptolemus, to thee, if living yet; from whence"
300,18,341,"I hop’d, dear friend, thy longer life safely return’d from hence,"
300,18,342,"And my life quitting thine, had pow’r to ship him home, and show"
300,18,343,"His young eyes Phthia, subjects, court; my father being now"
300,18,344,"Dead, or most short - liv’d, troublous age oppressing him, and fear"
300,18,345,"Still of my death’s news.” These sad words, he blew into the ear"
300,18,346,"Of ev’ry visitant with sighs, all echo’d by the peers,"
300,18,347,Rememb’ring who they left at home. All whose so humane tears
300,18,348,"Jove pitied; and, since they all would in the good of one"
300,18,349,"Be much reviv’d, he thus bespake Minerva: “Thetis’ son,"
300,18,350,"Now, daughter, thou hast quite forgot. O, is Achilles care"
300,18,351,"Extinguish’d in thee? Prostrated in most extreme ill fare,"
300,18,352,"He lies before his high - sail’d fleet, for his dead friend; the rest"
300,18,353,"Are strength’ning them with meat, but he lies desp’rately oppress’d"
300,18,354,"With heartless fasting. Go thy ways, and to his breast instill"
300,18,355,"Red nectar and ambrosia, that fast procure no ill"
300,18,356,"To his near enterprise.” This spur he added to the free,"
300,18,357,"And, like a harpy, with a voice that shrieks so dreadfully,"
300,18,358,"And feathers that like needles prick’d, she stoop’d through all the"
300,18,359,"stars,"
300,18,360,"Amongst the Grecians, all whose tents were now fill’d for the wars;"
300,18,361,"Her seres strook through Achilles’ tent, and closely she instill’d"
300,18,362,"Heav’n’s most - to - be - desired feast to his great breast, and fill’d"
300,18,363,"His sinews with that sweet supply, for fear unsavoury fast"
300,18,364,Should creep into his knees. Herself the skies again enchas’d.
300,18,365,"The host set forth, and pour’d his steel waves far out of the fleet."
300,18,366,"And as from air the frosty north wind blows a cold thick sleet,"
300,18,367,"That dazzles eyes, flakes after flakes incessantly descending;"
300,18,368,"So thick, helms, curets, ashen darts, and round shields, never ending,"
300,18,369,Flow’d from the navy’s hollow womb. Their splendours gave heav’n’s eye
300,18,370,His beams again. Earth laugh’d to see her face so like the sky;
300,18,371,"Arms shin’d so hot, and she such clouds made with the dust she cast,"
300,18,372,"She thunder’d, feet of men and horse importun’d her so fast."
300,18,373,"In midst of all, divine Achilles his fair person arm’d,"
300,18,374,"His teeth gnash’d as he stood, his eyes so full of fire they warm’d,"
300,18,375,Unsuffer’d grief and anger at the Trojans so combin’d.
300,18,376,"His greaves first us’d, his goodly curets on his bosom shin’d,"
300,18,377,"His sword, his shield that cast a brightness from it like the moon."
300,18,378,And as from sea sailors discern a harmful fire let run
300,18,379,"By herdsmen’s faults, till all their stall flies up in wrestling flame;"
300,18,380,"Which being on hills is seen far off; but being alone, none came"
300,18,381,"To give it quench, at shore no neighbours, and at sea their friends"
300,18,382,"Driv’n off with tempests; such a fire, from his bright shield extends"
300,18,383,"His ominous radiance, and in heav’n impress’d his fervent blaze."
300,18,384,"His crested helmet, grave and high, had next triumphant place"
300,18,385,"On his curl’d head, and like a star it cast a spurry ray,"
300,18,386,"About which a bright thicken’d bush of golden hair did play,"
300,18,387,"Which Vulcan forg’d him for his plume. Thus cómplete arm’d, he tried"
300,18,388,"How fit they were, and if his motion could with ease abide"
300,18,389,"Their brave instruction; and so far they were from hind’ring it,"
300,18,390,"That to it they were nimble wings, and made so light his spirit,"
300,18,391,That from the earth the princely captain they took up to air.
300,18,392,"Then from his armoury he drew his lance, his father’s spear,"
300,18,393,"Huge, weighty, firm, that not a Greek but he himself alone"
300,18,394,"Knew how to shake; it grew upon the mountain Pelion,"
300,18,395,"From whóse height Chiron hew’d it for his sire, and fatal ’twas"
300,18,396,"To great - soul’d men, of Peleus and Pelion surnam’d Pelias."
300,18,397,"Then from the stable their bright horse, Automedon withdraws"
300,18,398,"And Alcymus; put poitrils on, and cast upon their jaws"
300,18,399,"Their bridles, hurling back the reins, and hung them on the seat."
300,18,400,"The fair scourge then Automedon takes up, and up doth get"
300,18,401,"To guide the horse. The fight’s seat last, Achilles took behind;"
300,18,402,"Who look’d so arm’d as if the sun, there fall’n from heav’n, had"
300,18,403,"shin’d,"
300,18,404,"And terribly thus charg’d his steeds: “Xanthus and Balius,"
300,18,405,"Seed of the Harpy, in the charge ye undertake of us,"
300,18,406,"Discharge it not as when Patroclus ye left dead in field,"
300,18,407,"But, when with blood, for this day’s fast observ’d, revenge shall yield"
300,18,408,"Our heart satiety, bring us off.” Thus, since Achilles spake"
300,18,409,"As if his aw’d steeds understood, ’twas Juno’s will to make"
300,18,410,"Vocal the palate of the one; who, shaking his fair head,"
300,18,411,"(Which in his mane, let fall to earth, he almost buried)"
300,18,412,"Thus Xanthus spake: “Ablest Achilles, now, at least, our care"
300,18,413,Shall bring thee off; but not far hence the fatal minutes are
300,18,414,"Of thy grave ruin. Nor shall we be then to be reprov’d,"
300,18,415,"But mightiest Fate, and the great God. Nor was thy best belov’d"
300,18,416,"Spoil’d so of arms by our slow pace, or courage’s impair;"
300,18,417,"The best of Gods, Latona’s son, that wears the golden hair,"
300,18,418,Gave him his death’s wound; though the grace he gave to Hector’s hand.
300,18,419,"We, like the spirit of the west, that all spirits can command"
300,18,420,"For pow’r of wing, could run him off; but thou thyself must go,"
300,18,421,So fate ordains; God and a man must give thee overthrow.”
300,18,422,"This said, the Furies stopp’d his voice. Achilles, far in rage,"
300,18,423,"Thus answer’d him: “It fits not thee, thus proudly to presage"
300,18,424,"My overthrow. I know myself, it is my fate to fall"
300,18,425,"Thus far from Phthia; yet that fate shall fail to vent her gall,"
300,18,426,"Till mine vent thousands.” These words us’d, he fell to horrid deeds,"
300,18,427,"Gave dreadful signal, and forthright made fly his one - hoof’d steeds."
300,18,428,THE END OF THE NINETEENTH BOOK.
300,18,429,"[1] Scyros was an isle in the sea Ægeum, where Achilles himself was"
300,18,430,"brought up, as well as his son."
300,19,1,THE ARGUMENT
300,19,2,"By Jove’s permission, all the Gods descend"
300,19,3,To aid on both parts. For the Greeks contend
300,19,4,"Juno, Minerva, Neptune, Mulciber,"
300,19,5,And Mercury. The Deities that prefer
300,19,6,"The Trojan part are Phœbus, Cyprides,"
300,19,7,"Phœbe, Latona, and the Foe to peace,"
300,19,8,With bright Scamander. Neptune in a mist
300,19,9,Preserves Æneas daring to resist
300,19,10,Achilles; by whose hand much scathe is done;
300,19,11,Besides the slaughter of old Priam’s son
300,19,12,"Young Polydor, whose rescue Hector makes;"
300,19,13,"Him flying, Phœbus to his rescue takes."
300,19,14,"The rest, all shunning their importun’d fates,"
300,19,15,Achilles beats even to the Ilian gates.
300,19,16,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,19,17,"In Upsilon, Strife stirs in heav’n;"
300,19,18,The day’s grace to the Greeks is giv’n.
300,19,19,"The Greeks thus arm’d, and made insatiate with desire of fight,"
300,19,20,"About thee, Peleus’ son, the foe, in ground of greatest height,"
300,19,21,"Stood opposite, rang’d. Then Jove charg’d Themis from Olympus’ top"
300,19,22,"To call a court. She ev’ry way dispers’d, and summon’d up"
300,19,23,"All Deities; not any flood, besides Oceanus,"
300,19,24,"But made appearance; not a nymph (that arbours odorous,"
300,19,25,"The heads of floods, and flow’ry meadows, make their sweet abodes)"
300,19,26,"Was absent there; but all at his court, that is King of Gods,"
300,19,27,"Assembled, and, in lightsome seats of admirable frame,"
300,19,28,"Perform’d for Jove by Vulcan, sat. Ev’n angry Neptune came,"
300,19,29,"Nor heard the Goddess with unwilling ear, but with the rest"
300,19,30,"Made free ascension from the sea, and did his state invest"
300,19,31,"In midst of all, began the council, and inquir’d of Jove"
300,19,32,"His reason for that sessión, and on what point did move"
300,19,33,His high intention for the foes; he thought the heat of war
300,19,34,Was then near breaking out in flames? To him the Thunderer:
300,19,35,“Thou knowest this council by the rest of those fore - purposes
300,19,36,That still inclin’d me; my cares still must succour the distress
300,19,37,"Of Troy; though in the mouth of Fate, yet vow I not to stir"
300,19,38,"One step from off this top of heav’n, but all th’ affair refer"
300,19,39,"To anyone. Here I’ll hold state, and freely take the joy"
300,19,40,Of either’s fate. Help whom ye please; for ’tis assur’d that Troy
300,19,41,"Not one day’s conflict can sustain against Æacides,"
300,19,42,If Heav’n oppose not. His mere looks threw darts enow t’ impress
300,19,43,"Their pow’rs with trembling; but when blows, sent from his fi’ry hand,"
300,19,44,(Thrice heat by slaughter of his friend) shall come and countermand
300,19,45,"Their former glories, we have fear, that though Fate keep their wall,"
300,19,46,He’ll overturn it. Then descend; and cease not till ye all
300,19,47,Add all your aids; mix earth and heav’n together with the fight
300,19,48,Achilles urgeth.” These his words did such a war excite
300,19,49,As no man’s pow’r could wrastle down; the Gods with parted hearts
300,19,50,"Departed heav’n, and made earth war. To guide the Grecian darts,"
300,19,51,"Juno and Pallas, with the God that doth the earth embrace,"
300,19,52,And most - for - man’s - use Mercury (whom good wise inwards grace)
300,19,53,Were partially and all employ’d; and with them halted down
300,19,54,"(Proud of his strength) lame Mulciber, his walkers quite misgrown,"
300,19,55,"But made him tread exceeding sure. To aid the Ilian side,"
300,19,56,"The changeable in arms went, Mars; and him accompanied"
300,19,57,"Diana that delights in shafts, and Phœbus never shorn,"
300,19,58,"And Aphrodite laughter - pleas’d, and She of whom was born"
300,19,59,"Still young Apollo, and the Flood that runs on golden sands"
300,19,60,"Bright Xanthus. All these aided Troy; and, till these lent their hands,"
300,19,61,The Grecians triumph’d in the aid Æacides did add;
300,19,62,The Trojans trembling with his sight; so gloriously clad
300,19,63,"He overshin’d the field, and Mars no harmfuller than he,"
300,19,64,He bore the iron stream on clear. But when Jove’s high decree
300,19,65,"Let fall the Gods amongst their troops, the field swell’d, and the"
300,19,66,fight
300,19,67,"Grew fierce and horrible. The Dame, that armies doth excite,"
300,19,68,"Thunder’d with clamour, sometimes set at dike without the wall,"
300,19,69,"And sometimes on the bellowing shore. On th’ other side, the call"
300,19,70,"Of Mars to fight was terrible, he cried out like a storm,"
300,19,71,Set on the city’s pinnacles; and there he would inform
300,19,72,"Sometimes his heart’nings, other times where Simois pours on"
300,19,73,His silver current at the foot of high Callicolon.
300,19,74,"And thus the bless’d Gods both sides urg’d; they all stood in the mids,"
300,19,75,And brake contention to the hosts. And over all their heads
300,19,76,The Gods’ King in abhorréd claps his thunder rattled out.
300,19,77,Beneath them Neptune toss’d the earth; the mountains round about
300,19,78,Bow’d with affright and shook their heads; Jove’s hill the earthquake
300,19,79,"felt,"
300,19,80,"(Steep Ida) trembling at her roots, and all her fountains spilt,"
300,19,81,Their brows all crannied; Troy did nod; the Grecian navy play’d
300,19,82,"As on the sea; th’ Infernal King, that all things frays, was fray’d,"
300,19,83,"And leap’d affrighted from his throne, cried out, lest over him"
300,19,84,"Neptune should rend in two the earth, and so his house, so dim,"
300,19,85,"So loathsome, filthy, and abhorr’d of all the Gods beside,"
300,19,86,"Should open both to Gods and men. Thus all things shook and cried,"
300,19,87,When this black battle of the Gods was joining. Thus array’d
300,19,88,"‘Gainst Neptune, Phœbus with wing’d shafts; ’gainst Mars, the blue - ey’d"
300,19,89,Maid;
300,19,90,"‘Gainst Juno, Phœbe, whose white hands bore singing darts of gold,"
300,19,91,"Her side arm’d with a sheaf of shafts, and (by the birth twofold"
300,19,92,Of bright Latona) sister twin to Him that shoots so far.
300,19,93,"Against Latona, Hermes stood, grave guard, in peace and war,"
300,19,94,"Of human beings. ’Gainst the God, whose empire is in fire,"
300,19,95,"The wat’ry Godhead, that great Flood, to show whose pow’r entire"
300,19,96,"In spoil as th’ other, all his stream on lurking whirlpits trod,"
300,19,97,"Xanthus by Gods, by men Scamander, call’d. Thus God ’gainst God"
300,19,98,Enter’d the field. Æacides sustain’d a fervent mind
300,19,99,"To cope with Hector; past all these, his spirit stood inclin’d"
300,19,100,To glut Mars with the blood of him. And at Æacides
300,19,101,Apollo sent Anchises’ son; but first he did impress
300,19,102,"A more than natural strength in him, and made him feel th’ excess"
300,19,103,"Infus’d from heav’n; Lycaon’s shape gave show to his address,"
300,19,104,"(Old Priam’s son) and thus he spake: “Thou counsellor of Troy,"
300,19,105,Where now fly out those threats that late put all our peers in joy
300,19,106,"Of thy fight with Æacides? Thy tongue once, steep’d in wine,"
300,19,107,Durst vaunt as much.” He answer’d him: “But why wouldst thou incline
300,19,108,"My pow’rs ’gainst that proud enemy, and ’gainst my present heat?"
300,19,109,"I mean not now to bid him blows. That fear sounds my retreat,"
300,19,110,"That heretofore discourag’d me, when after he had ras’d"
300,19,111,"Lyrnessus, and strong Pedasus, his still breath’d fury chas’d"
300,19,112,"Our oxen from th’ Idæan hill, and set on me; but Jove"
300,19,113,"Gave strength and knees, and bore me off, that had not walk’d above"
300,19,114,This centre now but propp’d by him; Minerva’s hand (that held
300,19,115,"A light to this her favourite, whose beams show’d and impell’d"
300,19,116,"His pow’rs to spoil) had ruin’d me, for these ears heard her cry:"
300,19,117,"‘Kill, kill the seed of Ilion, kill th’ Asian Lelegi.’"
300,19,118,"Mere man then must not fight with him that still hath Gods to friend,"
300,19,119,"Averting death on others’ darts, and giving his no end"
300,19,120,But with the ends of men. If God like fortune in the fight
300,19,121,"Would give my forces, not with ease wing’d victory should light"
300,19,122,"On his proud shoulders, nor he ’scape, though all of brass he boasts"
300,19,123,"His plight consisteth.” He replied: “Pray thou those Gods of hosts,"
300,19,124,"Whom he implores, as well as he; and his chance may be thine;"
300,19,125,Thou cam’st of Gods like him; the Queen that reigns in Salamine
300,19,126,"Fame sounds thy mother; he deriv’d of lower Deity,"
300,19,127,"Old Nereus’ daughter bearing him. Bear then thy heart as high,"
300,19,128,And thy unwearied steel as right; nor utterly be beat
300,19,129,"With only cruelty of words, not proof against a threat.”"
300,19,130,"This strengthen’d him, and forth he rush’d; nor could his strength’ning"
300,19,131,fly
300,19,132,"White - wristed Juno, nor his drifts. She ev’ry Deity"
300,19,133,"Of th’ Achive faction called to her, and said: “Ye must have care,"
300,19,134,"Neptune and Pallas, for the frame of this important war"
300,19,135,"Ye undertake here. Venus’ son, by Phœbus being impell’d,"
300,19,136,"Runs on Achilles; turn him back, or see our friend upheld"
300,19,137,By one of us. Let not the spirit of Æacides
300,19,138,"Be over - dar’d, but make him know the mightiest Deities"
300,19,139,"Stand kind to him; and that the Gods, protectors of these tow’rs"
300,19,140,"That fight against Greece, and were here before our eminent pow’rs,"
300,19,141,"Bear no importance. And besides, that all we stoop from heav’n,"
300,19,142,"To curb this fight, that no impair be to his person giv’n"
300,19,143,"By any Trojans, nor their aids, while this day bears the sun."
300,19,144,"Hereafter, all things that are wrapp’d in his birth - thread, and spun"
300,19,145,"By Parcas in that point of time his mother gave him air,"
300,19,146,He must sustain. But if report perform not the repair
300,19,147,"Of all this to him, by the voice of some Immortal State,"
300,19,148,He may be fearful (if some God should set on him) that Fate
300,19,149,"Makes him her minister. The Gods, when they appear to men,"
300,19,150,"And manifest their proper forms, are passing dreadful then.”"
300,19,151,"Neptune replied: “Saturnia, at no time let your care"
300,19,152,"Exceed your reason; ’tis not fit. Where only humans are,"
300,19,153,"We must not mix the hands of Gods, our odds is too extreme."
300,19,154,"Sit we by, in some place of height, where we may see to them,"
300,19,155,And leave the wars of men to men. But if we see from thence
300,19,156,"Or Mars or Phœbus enter fight, or offer least offence"
300,19,157,"To Thetis’ son, not giving free way to his conqu’ring rage,"
300,19,158,Then comes the conflict to our cares; we soon shall disengage
300,19,159,"Achilles, and send them to heav’n, to settle their abode"
300,19,160,"With equals, flying under - strifes.” This said, the black - hair’d God"
300,19,161,"Led to the tow’r of Hercules, built circular and high"
300,19,162,"By Pallas and the Ilians, for fit security"
300,19,163,"To Jove’s divine son ’gainst the whale, that drave him from the shore"
300,19,164,"To th’ ample field. There Neptune sat, and all the Gods that bore"
300,19,165,"The Greeks good meaning, casting all thick mantles made of clouds"
300,19,166,On their bright shoulders. Th’ oppos’d Gods sat hid in other shrouds
300,19,167,"On top of steep Callicolon, about thy golden sides,"
300,19,168,"O Phœbus, brandisher of darts, and thine, whose rage abides"
300,19,169,"No peace in cities. In this state, these Gods in council sate,"
300,19,170,"All ling’ring purpos’d fight, to try who first would elevate"
300,19,171,"His heav’nly weapon. High - thron’d Jove cried out to set them on,"
300,19,172,"Said, all the field was full of men, and that the earth did groan"
300,19,173,"With feet of proud encounterers, burn’d with the arms of men"
300,19,174,And barbed horse. Two champions for both the armies then
300,19,175,"Met in their midst prepar’d for blows; divine Æacides,"
300,19,176,"And Venus’ son. Æneas first stepp’d threat’ning forth the prease,"
300,19,177,"His high helm nodding, and his breast barr’d with a shady shield,"
300,19,178,And shook his jav’lin. Thetis’ son did his part to the field.
300,19,179,As when the harmful king of beasts (sore threaten’d to be slain
300,19,180,By all the country up in arms) at first makes coy disdain
300,19,181,"Prepare resistance, but at last, when anyone hath led"
300,19,182,"Bold charge upon him with his dart, he then turns yawning head,"
300,19,183,"Fell anger lathers in his jaws, his great heart swells, his stern"
300,19,184,"Lasheth his strength up, sides and thighs waddled with stripes to learn"
300,19,185,"Their own pow’r, his eyes glow, he roars, and in he leaps to kill,"
300,19,186,Secure of killing; so his pow’r then rous’d up to his will
300,19,187,"Matchless Achilles, coming on to meet Anchises’ son."
300,19,188,"Both near, Achilles thus inquir’d: “Why stand’st thou thus alone,"
300,19,189,Thou son of Venus? Calls thy heart to change of blows with me?
300,19,190,Sure Troy’s whole kingdom is propos’d: some one hath promis’d thee
300,19,191,"The throne of Priam for my life; but Priam’s self is wise,"
300,19,192,"And, for my slaughter, not so mad to make his throne thy prise."
300,19,193,"Priam hath sons to second him. Is’t then some piece of land,"
300,19,194,"Past others fit to set and sow, that thy victorious hand"
300,19,195,The Ilians offer for my head? I hope that prise will prove
300,19,196,"No easy conquest. Once, I think, my busy jav’lin drove,"
300,19,197,"With terror, those thoughts from your spleen. Retain’st thou not the"
300,19,198,"time,"
300,19,199,When single on th’ Idæan hill I took thee with the crime
300,19,200,"Of runaway, thy oxen left, and when thou hadst no face"
300,19,201,"That I could see; thy knees bereft it, and Lyrnessus was"
300,19,202,"The mask for that? Then that mask, too, I open’d to the air"
300,19,203,"(By Jove and Pallas’ help) and took the free light from the fair,"
300,19,204,Your ladies bearing prisoners; but Jove and th’ other Gods
300,19,205,"Then saft thee. Yet again I hope, they will not add their odds"
300,19,206,"To save thy wants, as thou presum’st. Retire then, aim not at"
300,19,207,Troy’s throne by me; fly ere thy soul flies; fools are wise too late.”
300,19,208,He answer’d him: “Hope not that words can child - like terrify
300,19,209,"My stroke - proof breast. I well could speak in this indecency,"
300,19,210,"And use tart terms; but we know well what stock us both put out,"
300,19,211,Too gentle to bear fruits so rude. Our parents ring about
300,19,212,"The world’s round bosom, and by fame their dignities are blown"
300,19,213,"To both our knowledges, by sight neither to either known,"
300,19,214,"Thine to mine eyes, nor mine to thine. Fame sounds thy worthiness"
300,19,215,"From famous Peleus; the sea - nymph, that hath the lovely tress,"
300,19,216,"Thetis, thy mother; I myself affirm my sire to be"
300,19,217,"Great - soul’d Anchises; she that holds the Paphian Deity,"
300,19,218,My mother. And of these this light is now t’ exhale the tears
300,19,219,"For their lov’d issue; thee or me; childish, unworthy, dares"
300,19,220,Are not enough to part our pow’rs; for if thy spirits want
300,19,221,"Due excitation, by distrust of that desert I vaunt,"
300,19,222,"To set up all rests for my life, I’ll lineally prove"
300,19,223,"(Which many will confirm) my race. First, cloud - commanding Jove"
300,19,224,"Was sire to Dardanus, that built Dardania; for the walls"
300,19,225,Of sacred Ilion spread not yet these fields; those fair - built halls
300,19,226,"Of divers - languag’d men, not rais’d; all then made populous"
300,19,227,The foot of Ida’s fountful hill. This Jove - got Dardanus
300,19,228,"Begot king Erichthonius, for wealth past all compares"
300,19,229,"Of living mortals; in his fens he fed three thousand mares,"
300,19,230,"All neighing by their tender foals, of which twice - six were bred"
300,19,231,"By lofty Boreas, their dams lov’d by him as they fed,"
300,19,232,"He took the brave form of a horse that shook an azure mane,"
300,19,233,"And slept with them. These twice - six colts had pace so swift, they ran"
300,19,234,"Upon the top - ayles of corn - ears, nor bent them any whit;"
300,19,235,"And when the broad back of the sea their pleasure was to sit,"
300,19,236,"The superficies of his waves they slid upon, their hoves"
300,19,237,Not dipp’d in dank sweat of his brows. Of Erichthonius’ loves
300,19,238,"Sprang Tros, the king of Trojans. Tros three young princes bred,"
300,19,239,"Ilus, renown’d Assaracus, and heav’nly Ganymed"
300,19,240,"The fairest youth of all that breath’d, whom, for his beauty’s love,"
300,19,241,"The Gods did ravish to their state, to bear the cup to Jove."
300,19,242,"Ilus begot Laomedon, God - like Laomedon"
300,19,243,"Got Tithon, Priam, Clytius, Mars - like Hycetaon,"
300,19,244,"And Lampus. Great Assaracus, Capys begot; and he"
300,19,245,"Anchises. Prince Anchises, me. King Priam, Hector. We"
300,19,246,"Sprang both of one high family. Thus fortunate men give birth,"
300,19,247,"But Jove gives virtue; he augments, and he impairs the worth"
300,19,248,"Of all men; and his will their rule; he, strong’st, all strength"
300,19,249,affords.
300,19,250,"Why then paint we, like dames, the face of conflict with our words?"
300,19,251,"Both may give language that a ship, driv’n with a hundred oars,"
300,19,252,"Would overburthen. A man’s tongue is voluble, and pours"
300,19,253,Words out of all sorts ev’ry way. Such as you speak you hear.
300,19,254,"What then need we vie calumnies, like women that will wear"
300,19,255,"Their tongues out, being once incens’d, and strive for strife to part"
300,19,256,"(Being on their way) they travel so? From words, words may avert;"
300,19,257,"From virtue, not. It is your steel, divine Æacides,"
300,19,258,"Must prove my proof, as mine shall yours.” Thus amply did he ease"
300,19,259,His great heart of his pedigree; and sharply sent away
300,19,260,"A dart that caught Achilles’ shield, and rung so it did fray"
300,19,261,"The son of Thetis, his fair hand far - thrusting out his shield,"
300,19,262,"For fear the long lance had driv’n through. O fool, to think ’twould"
300,19,263,"yield,"
300,19,264,And not to know the God’s firm gifts want want to yield so soon
300,19,265,To men’s poor pow’rs. The eager lance had only conquest won
300,19,266,"Of two plates, and the shield had five, two forg’d of tin, two brass,"
300,19,267,"One, that was centre - plate, of gold; and that forbad the pass"
300,19,268,Of Anchisiades’s lance. Then sent Achilles forth
300,19,269,"His lance, that through the first fold strook, where brass of little"
300,19,270,worth
300,19,271,And no great proof of hides was laid; through all which Pelias ran
300,19,272,"His iron head, and after it his ashen body wan"
300,19,273,"Pass to the earth, and there it stuck, his top on th’ other side,"
300,19,274,"And hung the shield up; which hard down Æneas pluck’d, to hide"
300,19,275,"His breast from sword blows, shrunk up round, and in his heavy eye"
300,19,276,"Was much grief shadow’d, much afraid that Pelias stuck so nigh."
300,19,277,"Then prompt Achilles rushing in, his sword drew; and the field"
300,19,278,"Rung with his voice. Æneas now, left and let hang his shield,"
300,19,279,"And all - distracted, up he snatch’d a two - men’s strength of stone,"
300,19,280,"And either at his shield or casque he set it rudely gone,"
300,19,281,"Nor car’d where, so it strook a place that put on arms for death."
300,19,282,But he (Achilles came so close) had doubtless sunk beneath
300,19,283,His own death had not Neptune seen and interpos’d the odds
300,19,284,"Of his divine pow’r, utt’ring this to the Achaian Gods:"
300,19,285,"“I grieve for this great - hearted man; he will be sent to hell,"
300,19,286,"Ev’n instantly, by Peleus’ son, being only mov’d to deal"
300,19,287,By Phœbus’ words. What fool is he! Phœbus did never mean
300,19,288,To add to his great words his guard against the ruin then
300,19,289,"Summon’d against him. And what cause, hath he to head him on"
300,19,290,"To others’ mis’ries, he being clear of any trespass done"
300,19,291,Against the Grecians? Thankful gifts he oft hath giv’n to us.
300,19,292,"Let us then quit him, and withdraw this combat; for if thus"
300,19,293,"Achilles end him, Jove will rage; since his escape in fate"
300,19,294,"Is purpos’d, lest the progeny of Dardanus take date,"
300,19,295,"Whom Jove, past all his issue, lov’d, begot of mortal dames."
300,19,296,All Priam’s race he hates; and this must propagate the names
300,19,297,"Of Trojans, and their sons’ sons’ rule, to all posterity.”"
300,19,298,"Saturnia said: “Make free your pleasure. Save, or let him die."
300,19,299,"Pallas and I have taken many, and most public, oaths,"
300,19,300,"That th’ ill day never shall avert her eye, red with our wroths,"
300,19,301,"From hated Troy; no, not when all in studied fire she flames"
300,19,302,"The Greek rage, blowing her last coal.” This nothing turn’d his aims"
300,19,303,"From present rescue, but through all the whizzing spears he pass’d,"
300,19,304,And came where both were combating; when instantly he cast
300,19,305,"A mist before Achilles’ eyes, drew from the earth and shield"
300,19,306,"His lance, and laid it at his feet; and then took up and held"
300,19,307,"Aloft the light Anchises’ son, who pass’d, with Neptune’s force,"
300,19,308,"Whole orders of heroës’ heads, and many a troop of horse"
300,19,309,"Leap’d over, till the bounds he reach’d of all the fervent broil,"
300,19,310,"Where all the Caucons’ quarters lay. Thus, far freed from the toil,"
300,19,311,"Neptune had time to use these words: “Æneas, who was he"
300,19,312,"Of all the Gods, that did so much neglect thy good and thee"
300,19,313,"To urge thy fight with Thetis’ son, who in immortal rates"
300,19,314,"Is better and more dear than thee? Hereafter, lest, past fates,"
300,19,315,"Hell be thy headlong home, retire, make bold stand never near"
300,19,316,"Where he advanceth. But his fate once satisfied, then bear"
300,19,317,"A free and full sail; no Greek else shall end thee.” This reveal’d,"
300,19,318,"He left him, and dispers’d the cloud, that all this act conceal’d"
300,19,319,"From vex’d Achilles; who again had clear light from the skies,"
300,19,320,"And, much disdaining the escape, said: “O ye Gods, mine eyes"
300,19,321,"Discover miracles! My lance submitted, and he gone"
300,19,322,At whom I sent it with desire of his confusion!
300,19,323,Æneas sure was lov’d of heav’n. I thought his vaunt from thence
300,19,324,"Had flow’d from glory. Let him go, no more experience"
300,19,325,"Will his mind long for of my hands, he flies them now so clear."
300,19,326,"Cheer then the Greeks, and others try.” Thus rang’d he ev’rywhere"
300,19,327,The Grecian orders; ev’ry man (of which the most look’d on
300,19,328,To see their fresh lord shake his lance) he thus put charge upon:
300,19,329,"“Divine Greeks, stand not thus at gaze, but man to man apply"
300,19,330,Your sev’ral valours. ’Tis a task laid too unequally
300,19,331,"On me left to so many men, one man oppos’d to all."
300,19,332,"Not Mars, immortal and a God, not war’s She - General,"
300,19,333,"A field of so much fight could chase, and work it out with blows."
300,19,334,"But what a man may execute, that all limbs will expose,"
300,19,335,And all their strength to th’ utmost nerve (though now I lost some play
300,19,336,By some strange miracle) no more shall burn in vain the day
300,19,337,"To any least beam. All this host, I’ll ransack, and have hope,"
300,19,338,"Of all not one again will scape, whoever gives such scope"
300,19,339,"To his adventure, and so near dares tempt my angry lance.”"
300,19,340,Thus he excited. Hector then as much strives to advance
300,19,341,"The hearts of his men, adding threats, affirming he would stand"
300,19,342,"In combat with Æacides: “Give fear,” said he, “no hand"
300,19,343,"Of your great hearts, brave Ilians, for Peleus’ talking son,"
300,19,344,"I’ll fight with any God with words; but when their spears put on,"
300,19,345,"The work runs high, their strength exceeds mortality so far,"
300,19,346,And they may make works crown their words; which holds not in the war
300,19,347,"Achilles makes; his hands have bounds; this word he shall make good,"
300,19,348,And leave another to the field. His worst shall be withstood
300,19,349,With sole objection of myself; though in his hands he bear
300,19,350,"A rage like fire, though fire itself his raging fingers were,"
300,19,351,And burning steel flew in his strength.” Thus he incited his;
300,19,352,"And they rais’d lances, and to work with mixéd courages;"
300,19,353,"And up flew Clamour. But the heat in Hector, Phœbus gave"
300,19,354,"This temper: “Do not meet,” said he, “in any single brave"
300,19,355,"The man thou threaten’st, but in press; and in thy strength impeach"
300,19,356,"His violence; for, far off, or near, his sword or dart will reach.”"
300,19,357,The God’s voice made a difference in Hector’s own conceit
300,19,358,"Betwixt his and Achilles’ words, and gave such over - weight"
300,19,359,"As weigh’d him back into his strength, and curb’d his flying out."
300,19,360,"At all threw fierce Æacides, and gave a horrid shout."
300,19,361,"The first, of all he put to dart, was fierce Iphition,"
300,19,362,"Surnam’d Otryntides, whom Nais the water - nymph made son"
300,19,363,To town - destroy’r Otrynteüs. Beneath the snowy hill
300,19,364,"Of Tmolus, in the wealthy town of Hyda, at his will"
300,19,365,"Were many able men at arms. He, rushing in, took full"
300,19,366,"Pelides’ lance in his head’s midst, that cleft in two his skull."
300,19,367,"Achilles knew him one much fam’d, and thus insulted then:"
300,19,368,"“Th’ art dead, Otryntides, though call’d the terriblest of men."
300,19,369,"Thy race runs at Gygæus’ lake, there thy inheritance lay,"
300,19,370,Near fishy Hyllus and the gulfs of Hermus; but this day
300,19,371,Removes it to the fields of Troy.” Thus left he night to seize
300,19,372,"His closéd eyes, his body laid in course of all the prease,"
300,19,373,Which Grecian horse broke with the strakes nail’d to their chariot
300,19,374,wheels.
300,19,375,"Next, through the temples, the burst eyes his deadly jav’lin seels"
300,19,376,"Of great - in - Troy Antenor’s son, renown’d Demoleon,"
300,19,377,A mighty turner of a field. His overthrow set gone
300,19,378,"Hippodamas; who leap’d from horse, and, as he fled before"
300,19,379,"Æacides’s turnéd back, he made fell Pelias gore,"
300,19,380,"And forth he puff’d his flying soul. And as a tortur’d bull,"
300,19,381,"To Neptune brought for sacrifice, a troop of youngsters pull"
300,19,382,"Down to the earth, and drag him round about the hallow’d shore,"
300,19,383,"To please the wat’ry Deity with forcing him to roar,"
300,19,384,And forth he pours his utmost throat; so bellow’d this slain friend
300,19,385,"Of flying Ilion, with the breath that gave his being end."
300,19,386,"Then rush’d he on, and in his eye had heav’nly Polydore,"
300,19,387,"Old Priam’s son, whom last of all his fruitful princess bore,"
300,19,388,"And for his youth, being dear to him, the king forbad to fight."
300,19,389,"Yet (hot of unexperienc’d blood, to show how exquisite"
300,19,390,"He was of foot, for which of all the fifty sons he held"
300,19,391,"The special name) he flew before the first heat of the field,"
300,19,392,"Ev’n till he flew out breath and soul; which, through the back, the"
300,19,393,lance
300,19,394,"Of swift Achilles put in air, and did his head advance"
300,19,395,"Out at his navel. On his knees the poor prince crying fell,"
300,19,396,"And gather’d with his tender hands his entrails, that did swell"
300,19,397,"Quite through the wide wound, till a cloud as black as death conceal’d"
300,19,398,"Their sight, and all the world from him. When Hector had beheld"
300,19,399,"His brother tumbled so to earth, his entrails still in hand,"
300,19,400,Dark sorrow overcast his eyes; nor far off could he stand
300,19,401,"A minute longer, but like fire he brake out of the throng,"
300,19,402,Shook his long lance at Thetis’ son; and then came he along
300,19,403,"To feed th’ encounter: “O,” said he, “here comes the man that most"
300,19,404,"Of all the world destroys my mind, the man by whom I lost"
300,19,405,My dear Patroclus. Now not long the crooked paths of war
300,19,406,"Can yield us any privy scapes. ‘Come, keep not off so far,’"
300,19,407,"He cried to Hector, ‘make the pain of thy sure death as short,"
300,19,408,As one so desp’rate of his life hath reason.’” In no sort
300,19,409,"This frighted Hector, who bore close, and said: “Æacides,"
300,19,410,Leave threats for children. I have pow’r to thunder calumnies
300,19,411,"As well as others, and well know thy strength superior far"
300,19,412,"To that my nerves hold; but the Gods, not nerves, determine war."
300,19,413,"And yet, for nerves, there will be found a strength of pow’r in mine"
300,19,414,To drive a lance home to thy life. My lance as well as thine
300,19,415,"Hath point and sharpness, and ’tis this.” Thus brandishing his spear,"
300,19,416,He set it flying; which a breath of Pallas back did bear
300,19,417,"From Thetis’ son to Hector’s self, and at his feet it fell."
300,19,418,"Achilles us’d no dart, but close flew in; and thought to deal"
300,19,419,"With no strokes but of sure dispatch, but, what with all his blood"
300,19,420,"He labour’d, Phœbus clear’d with ease, as being a God, and stood"
300,19,421,"For Hector’s guard, as Pallas did, Æacides, for thine."
300,19,422,"He rapt him from him, and a cloud of much night cast between"
300,19,423,His person and the point oppos’d. Achilles then exclaim’d:
300,19,424,"“O see, yet more Gods are at work. Apollo’s hand hath fram’d,"
300,19,425,"Dog that thou art, thy rescue now; to whom go pay thy vows"
300,19,426,"Thy safety owes him, I shall vent in time those fatal blows"
300,19,427,"That yet beat in my heart on thine, if any God remain"
300,19,428,"My equal fautor. In mean time, my anger must maintain"
300,19,429,His fire on other Ilians.” Then laid he at his feet
300,19,430,"Great Demuchus, Philetor’s son; and Dryope did greet"
300,19,431,"With like encounter. Dardanus and strong Laogonus,"
300,19,432,"Wise Bias’ sons, he hurl’d from horse; of one victorious"
300,19,433,"With his close sword, the other’s life he conquer’d with his lance."
300,19,434,"Then Tros, Alastor’s son, made in, and sought to scape their chance"
300,19,435,"With free submission. Down he fell, and pray’d about his knees"
300,19,436,"He would not kill him, but take ruth, as one that destinies"
300,19,437,"Made to that purpose, being a man born in the self same year"
300,19,438,"That he himself was. O poor fool, to sue to him to bear"
300,19,439,"A ruthful mind! He well might know, he could not fashion him"
300,19,440,"In ruth’s soft mould, he had no spirit to brook that interim"
300,19,441,"In his hot fury, he was none of these remorseful men,"
300,19,442,"Gentle and affable, but fierce at all times, and mad then."
300,19,443,"He gladly would have made a pray’r, and still so hugg’d his knee"
300,19,444,He could not quit him; till at last his sword was fain to free
300,19,445,"His fetter’d knees, that made a vent for his white liver’s blood"
300,19,446,That caus’d such pitiful affects; of which it pour’d a flood
300,19,447,"About his bosom, which it fill’d, ev’n till it drown’d his eyes,"
300,19,448,And all sense fail’d him. Forth then flew this prince of tragedies;
300,19,449,Who next stoop’d Mulius ev’n to death with his insatiate spear;
300,19,450,"One ear it enter’d, and made good his pass to th’ other ear."
300,19,451,"Echeclus then, Agenor’s son, he strook betwixt the brows;"
300,19,452,"Whose blood set fire upon his sword, that cool’d it till the throes"
300,19,453,"Of his then labouring brain let out his soul to fixéd fate,"
300,19,454,And gave cold entry to black death. Deucalion then had state
300,19,455,"In these men’s beings, where the nerves about the elbow knit,"
300,19,456,"Down to his hand his spear’s steel pierc’d, and brought such pain to it"
300,19,457,"As led death jointly; whom he saw before his fainting eyes,"
300,19,458,"And in his neck felt, with a stroke, laid on so, that off flies"
300,19,459,"His head. One of the twice - twelve bones, that all the backbone make,"
300,19,460,"Let out his marrow; when the head he, helm and all, did take,"
300,19,461,And hurl’d amongst the Ilians; the body stretch’d on earth.
300,19,462,Rhigmus of fruitful Thrace next fell. He was the famous birth
300,19,463,"Of Pireüs; his belly’s midst the lance took, whose stern force"
300,19,464,"Quite tumbled him from chariot. In turning back the horse,"
300,19,465,Their guider Areithous receiv’d another lance
300,19,466,That threw him to his lord. No end was put to the mischance
300,19,467,"Achilles enter’d. But as fire, fall’n in a flash from heav’n,"
300,19,468,"Inflames the high woods of dry hills, and with a storm is driv’n"
300,19,469,"Through all the sylvan deeps; and raves, till down goes ev’rywhere"
300,19,470,The smother’d hill; so ev’ry way Achilles and his spear
300,19,471,"Consum’d the champain, the black earth flow’d with the veins he tore."
300,19,472,"And look how oxen, yok’d and driv’n about the circular floor"
300,19,473,"Of some fair barn, tread suddenly the thick sheaves thin of corn,"
300,19,474,"And all the corn consum’d with chaff; so mix’d and overborne,"
300,19,475,"Beneath Achilles’ one - hoof’d horse, shields, spears, and men, lay trod,"
300,19,476,"His axle - trees and chariot wheels, all spatter’d with the blood"
300,19,477,"Hurl’d from the steeds’ hooves and the strakes. Thus, to be magnified,"
300,19,478,His most inaccessible hands in human blood he dyed.
300,19,479,THE END OF THE TWENTIETH BOOK.
300,19,480,THE TWENTY - FIRST BOOK OF HOMER’S ILIADS
300,19,481,THE ARGUMENT
300,19,482,In two parts Troy’s host parted; Thetis’ son
300,19,483,"One to Scamander, one to Ilion,"
300,19,484,"Pursues. Twelve lords he takes alive, to end"
300,19,485,In sacrifice for vengeance to his friend.
300,19,486,"Asteropæus dies by his fierce hand,"
300,19,487,"And, Priam’s son, Lycaon. Over land"
300,19,488,"The Flood breaks where Achilles being engag’d,"
300,19,489,"Vulcan preserves him, and with spirit enrag’d"
300,19,490,Sets all the champain and the floods on fire.
300,19,491,Contention then doth all the Gods inspire.
300,19,492,Apollo in Agenor’s shape doth stay
300,19,493,"Achilles’ fury, and, by giving way,"
300,19,494,"Makes him pursue, till the deceit gives leave"
300,19,495,That Troy in safety might her friends receive.
300,19,496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,19,497,Phy at the flood’s shore doth express
300,19,498,The labours of Æacides.
300,19,499,"And now they reach’d the goodly swelling channel of the flood,"
300,19,500,"Gulf - eating Xanthus, whom Jove mix’d with his immortal brood;"
300,19,501,And there Achilles cleft the host of Ilion; one side fell
300,19,502,"On Xanthus, th’ other on the town; and that did he impell"
300,19,503,"The same way that the last day’s rage put all the Greeks in rout,"
300,19,504,When Hector’s fury reign’d; these now Achilles pour’d about
300,19,505,"The scatter’d field. To stay the flight, Saturnia cast before"
300,19,506,Their hasty feet a standing fog; and then flight’s violence bore
300,19,507,The other half full on the flood. The silver - gulféd deep
300,19,508,"Receiv’d them with a mighty cry, the billows vast and steep"
300,19,509,"Roar’d at their armours, which the shores did round about resound;"
300,19,510,"This way and that they swum, and shriek’d as in the gulfs they drown’d"
300,19,511,"And as in fir’d fields locusts rise, as the unwearied blaze"
300,19,512,"Plies still their rising, till in swarms all rush as in amaze,"
300,19,513,For scape into some neighbour flood; so th’ Achilleian stroke
300,19,514,"Here drave the foe, the gulfy flood with men and horse did choke."
300,19,515,Then on the shore the Worthy hid and left his horrid lance
300,19,516,"Amids the tamarisks, and sprite - like did with his sword advance"
300,19,517,Up to the river; ill affairs took up his furious brain
300,19,518,For Troy’s engagements; ev’ry way he doubled slain on slain.
300,19,519,"A most unmanly noise was made, with those he put to sword,"
300,19,520,"Of groans and outcries. The flood blush’d, to be so much engor’d"
300,19,521,"With such base souls. And as small fish the swift - finn’d dolphin fly,"
300,19,522,"Filling the deep pits in the ports, on whose close strength they lie,"
300,19,523,"And there he swallows them in shoals; so here, to rocks and holes"
300,19,524,"About the flood, the Trojans fled, and there most lost their souls,"
300,19,525,Ev’n till he tir’d his slaught’rous arm. Twelve fair young princes then
300,19,526,"He chose of all to take alive, to have them freshly slain"
300,19,527,"On that most solemn day of wreak, resolv’d on for his friend."
300,19,528,"These led he trembling forth the flood, as fearful of their end"
300,19,529,As any hind calves. All their hands he pinioned behind
300,19,530,"With their own girdles worn upon their rich weeds, and resign’d"
300,19,531,Their persons to his Myrmidons to bear to fleet; and he
300,19,532,Plung’d in the stream again to take more work of tragedy.
300,19,533,"He met, then issuing the flood with all intent of flight,"
300,19,534,"Lycaon, Dardan Priam’s son; whom lately in the night"
300,19,535,"He had surpris’d, as in a wood of Priam’s he had cut"
300,19,536,"The green arms of a wild fig - tree, to make him spokes to put"
300,19,537,"In naves of his new chariot. An ill then, all unthought,"
300,19,538,"Stole on him in Achilles’ shape, who took him thence, and brought"
300,19,539,"To well - built Lemnos, selling him to famous Jason’s son."
300,19,540,From whom a guest then in his house (Imbrius Eetion)
300,19,541,"Redeem’d at high rate, and sent home t’ Arisba, whence he fled,"
300,19,542,And saw again his father’s court; elev’n days banqueted
300,19,543,Amongst his friends; the twelfth God thrust his hapless head again
300,19,544,"In t’ hands of stern Æacides, who now must send him slain"
300,19,545,"To Pluto’s court, and ’gainst his will. Him, when Achilles knew,"
300,19,546,"Naked of helmet, shield, sword, lance (all which for ease he threw"
300,19,547,"To earth, being overcome with sweat, and labour wearying"
300,19,548,"His flying knees) he storm’d, and said: “O heav’n, a wondrous thing"
300,19,549,"Invades mine eyes! Those Ilians, that heretofore I slew,"
300,19,550,Rise from the dark dead quick again. This man Fate makes eschew
300,19,551,"Her own steel fingers. He was sold in Lemnos, and the deep"
300,19,552,"Of all seas ’twixt this Troy, and that (that many a man doth keep"
300,19,553,"From his lov’d country) bars not him. Come then, he now shall taste"
300,19,554,"The head of Pelias, and try if steel will down as fast"
300,19,555,"As other fortunes, or kind earth can any surer seize"
300,19,556,"On his sly person, whose strong arms have held down Hercules.”"
300,19,557,"His thoughts thus mov’d, while he stood firm, to see if he, he spied,"
300,19,558,Would offer flight (which first he thought) but when he had descried
300,19,559,"He was descried and flight was vain, fearful, he made more nigh,"
300,19,560,"With purpose to embrace his knees, and now long’d much to fly"
300,19,561,His black fate and abhorréd death by coming in. His foe
300,19,562,"Observ’d all this, and up he rais’d his lance as he would throw;"
300,19,563,"And then Lycaon close ran in, fell on his breast, and took"
300,19,564,"Achilles’ knees; whose lance, on earth now staid, did overlook"
300,19,565,"His still turn’d back, with thirst to glut his sharp point with the"
300,19,566,blood
300,19,567,That lay so ready. But that thirst Lycaon’s thirst withstood
300,19,568,"To save his blood; Achilles’ knee in his one hand he knit,"
300,19,569,"His other held the long lance hard, and would not part with it,"
300,19,570,"But thus besought: “I kiss thy knees, divine Æacides!"
300,19,571,"Respect me, and my fortunes rue. I now present th’ access"
300,19,572,Of a poor suppliant for thy ruth; and I am one that is
300,19,573,"Worthy thy ruth, O Jove’s belov’d. First hour my miseries"
300,19,574,"Fell into any hand, ’twas thine. I tasted all my bread"
300,19,575,"By thy gift since, O since that hour that thy surprisal led"
300,19,576,"From forth the fair wood my sad feet, far from my lov’d allies,"
300,19,577,"To famous Lemnos, where I found a hundred oxen’s prize"
300,19,578,To make my ransom; for which now I thrice the worth will raise.
300,19,579,"This day makes twelve, since I arriv’d in Ilion, many days"
300,19,580,Being spent before in sufferance; and now a cruel fate
300,19,581,"Thrusts me again into thy hands. I should haunt Jove with hate,"
300,19,582,That with such set malignity gives thee my life again.
300,19,583,"There were but two of us for whom Laothoe suffer’d pain,"
300,19,584,"Laothoe, old Alte’s seed; Alte, whose palace stood"
300,19,585,"In height of upper Pedasus, near Satnius’ silver flood,"
300,19,586,And rul’d the war - like Lelegi. Whose seed (as many more)
300,19,587,"King Priam married, and begot the god - like Polydore,"
300,19,588,And me accurs’d. Thou slaughter’dst him; and now thy hand on me
300,19,589,"Will prove as mortal. I did think, when here I met with thee,"
300,19,590,"I could not ’scape thee; yet give ear, and add thy mind to it:"
300,19,591,"I told my birth to intimate, though one sire did beget"
300,19,592,"Yet one womb brought not into light Hector that slew thy friend,"
300,19,593,"And me. O do not kill me then, but let the wretched end"
300,19,594,Of Polydore excuse my life. For half our being bred
300,19,595,"Brothers to Hector, he (half) paid, no more is forfeited.”"
300,19,596,"Thus sued he humbly; but he heard, with this austere reply:"
300,19,597,"“Fool, urge not ruth nor price to me, till that solemnity,"
300,19,598,"Resolv’d on for Patroclus’ death, pay all his rites to fate."
300,19,599,"Till his death I did grace to Troy, and many lives did rate"
300,19,600,"At price of ransom; but none now, of all the brood of Troy,"
300,19,601,(Whoever Jove throws to my hands) shall any breath enjoy
300,19,602,"That death can beat out, specially that touch at Priam’s race."
300,19,603,"Die, die, my friend. What tears are these? What sad looks spoil thy"
300,19,604,face?
300,19,605,"Patroclus died, that far pass’d thee. Nay, seest thou not beside,"
300,19,606,"Myself, ev’n I, a fair young man, and rarely magnified,"
300,19,607,"And, to my father being a king, a mother have that sits"
300,19,608,"In rank with Goddesses; and yet, when thou hast spent thy spirits,"
300,19,609,"Death and as violent a fate must overtake ev’n me,"
300,19,610,"By twilight, morn - light, day, high noon, whenever destiny"
300,19,611,"Sets on her man to hurl a lance, or knit out of his string"
300,19,612,"An arrow that must reach my life.” This said, a languishing"
300,19,613,"Lycaon’s heart bent like his knees, yet left him strength t’ advance"
300,19,614,"Both hands for mercy as he kneel’d. His foe yet leaves his lance,"
300,19,615,"And forth his sword flies, which he hid in furrow of a wound"
300,19,616,"Driv’n through the jointure of his neck; flat fell he on the ground,"
300,19,617,"Stretch’d with death’s pangs, and all the earth imbru’d with timeless"
300,19,618,blood.
300,19,619,"Then gript Æacides his heel, and to the lofty flood"
300,19,620,"Flung, swinging, his unpitied corse, to see it swim, and toss"
300,19,621,"Upon the rough waves, and said; “Go, feed fat the fish with loss"
300,19,622,"Of thy left blood, they clean will suck thy green wounds; and this"
300,19,623,saves
300,19,624,Thy mother tears upon thy bed. Deep Xanthus on his waves
300,19,625,"Shall hoise thee bravely to a tomb, that in her burly breast"
300,19,626,"The sea shall open, where great fish may keep thy fun’ral feast"
300,19,627,"With thy white fat, and on the waves dance at thy wedding fate,"
300,19,628,"Clad in black horror, keeping close inaccessible state,"
300,19,629,"So perish Ilians, till we pluck the brows of Ilion"
300,19,630,"Down to her feet, you flying still, I flying still upon"
300,19,631,"Thus in the rear, and (as my brows were fork’d with rabid horns)[1]"
300,19,632,"Toss ye together. This brave flood, that strengthens and adorns"
300,19,633,"Your city with his silver gulfs, to whom so many bulls"
300,19,634,"Your zeal hath offer’d, which blind zeal his sacred current gulls,"
300,19,635,"With casting chariots and horse quick to his pray’d - for aid,"
300,19,636,"Shall nothing profit. Perish then, till cruell’st death hath laid"
300,19,637,"All at the red feet of Revenge for my slain friend, and all"
300,19,638,With whom the absence of my hands made yours a festival.”
300,19,639,"This speech great Xanthus more enrag’d, and made his spirit contend"
300,19,640,"For means to shut up the op’d vein against him, and defend"
300,19,641,"The Trojans in it from his plague. In mean time Peleus’ son,"
300,19,642,"And now with that long lance he hid, for more blood set upon"
300,19,643,"Asteropæus, the descent of Pelegon, and he"
300,19,644,"Of broad - stream’d Axius, and the dame, of first nativity"
300,19,645,"To all the daughters that renown’d Acesamenus’ seed,"
300,19,646,"Bright Peribœa, whom the Flood, arm’d thick with lofty reed,"
300,19,647,"Compress’d. At her grandchild now went Thetis’ great son, whose foe"
300,19,648,"Stood arm’d with two darts, being set on by Xanthus anger’d so"
300,19,649,For those youths’ blood shed in his stream by vengeful Thetis’ son
300,19,650,"Without all mercy. Both being near, great Thetides begun"
300,19,651,With this high question; “Of what race art thou that dar’st oppose
300,19,652,"Thy pow’r to mine thus? Curséd wombs they ever did disclose,"
300,19,653,That stood my anger.” He replied: “What makes thy fury’s heat
300,19,654,"Talk, and seek pedigrees? Far hence lies my innative seat,"
300,19,655,In rich Pæonia. My race from broad - stream’d Axius runs;
300,19,656,"Axius, that gives earth purest drink, of all the wat’ry sons"
300,19,657,"Of great Oceanus, and got the famous for his spear,"
300,19,658,"Pelegonus, that father’d me; and these Pæonians here,"
300,19,659,"Arm’d with long lances, here I lead; and here th’ elev’nth fair light"
300,19,660,"Shines on us since we enter’d Troy. Come now, brave man, let’s fight.”"
300,19,661,"Thus spake he, threat’ning; and to him Pelides made reply"
300,19,662,"With shaken Pelias; but his foe with two at once let fly,"
300,19,663,For both his hands were dexterous. One jav’lin strook the shield
300,19,664,"Of Thetis’ son, but strook not through; the gold, God’s gift, repell’d"
300,19,665,The eager point; the other lance fell lightly on the part
300,19,666,Of his fair right hand’s cubit; forth the black blood spun; the dart
300,19,667,"Glanc’d over, fast’ning on the earth, and there his spleen was spent"
300,19,668,"That wish’d the body. With which wish Achilles his lance sent,"
300,19,669,"That quite miss’d, and infix’d itself fast in steep - up shore;"
300,19,670,Ev’n to the midst it enter’d it. Himself then fiercely bore
300,19,671,Upon his enemy with his sword. His foe was tugging hard
300,19,672,"To get his lance out; thrice he pluck’d, and thrice sure Pelias barr’d"
300,19,673,"His wish’d evulsion; the fourth pluck, he bow’d and meant to break"
300,19,674,"The ashen plant, but, ere that act, Achilles’ sword did check"
300,19,675,"His bent pow’r, and brake out his soul. Full in the navel - stead"
300,19,676,"He ripp’d his belly up, and out his entrails fell, and dead"
300,19,677,"His breathless body; whence his arms Achilles drew, and said:"
300,19,678,"“Lie there, and prove it dangerous to lift up adverse head"
300,19,679,"Against Jove’s sons, although a Flood were ancestor to thee."
300,19,680,"Thy vaunts urg’d him, but I may vaunt a higher pedigree"
300,19,681,"From Jove himself. King Peleüs was son to Æacus,"
300,19,682,"Infernal Æacus to Jove, and I to Peleüs."
300,19,683,"Thunder - voic’d Jove far passeth floods, that only murmurs raise"
300,19,684,With earth and water as they run with tribute to the seas;
300,19,685,"And his seed theirs exceeds as far. A Flood, a mighty Flood,"
300,19,686,"Rag’d near thee now, but with no aid; Jove must not be withstood."
300,19,687,"King Achelous yields to him, and great Oceanus,"
300,19,688,"Whence all floods, all the sea, all founts, wells, all deeps humorous,"
300,19,689,"Fetch their beginnings; yet ev’n he fears Jove’s flash, and the crack"
300,19,690,"His thunder gives, when out of heav’n it tears atwo his rack.”[2]"
300,19,691,"Thus pluck’d he from the shore his lance, and left the waves to wash"
300,19,692,"The wave - sprung entrails, about which fausens and other fish"
300,19,693,"Did shoal, to nibble at the fat which his sweet kidneys hid."
300,19,694,"This for himself. Now to his men, the well - rode Pæons, did"
300,19,695,"His rage contend, all which cold fear shook into flight, to see"
300,19,696,"Their captain slain. At whose maz’d flight, as much enrag’d, flew he."
300,19,697,"And then fell all these, Thrasius, Mydon, Astypylus,"
300,19,698,"Great Ophelestes, Ænius, Mnesus, Thersilochus."
300,19,699,"And on these many more had fall’n, unless the angry Flood"
300,19,700,"Had took the figure of a man, and in a whirlpit stood,"
300,19,701,"Thus speaking to Æacides: “Past all, pow’r feeds thy will,"
300,19,702,"Thou great grandchild of Æacus, and, past all, th’ art in ill,"
300,19,703,"And Gods themselves confederates, and Jove, the best of Gods,"
300,19,704,"All deaths gives thee, all places not. Make my shores periods"
300,19,705,"To all shore service. In the field let thy field - acts run high,"
300,19,706,Not in my waters. My sweet streams choke with mortality
300,19,707,"Of men slain by thee. Carcasses so glut me, that I fail"
300,19,708,To pour into the sacred sea my waves; yet still assail
300,19,709,"Thy cruel forces. Cease, amaze affects me with thy rage,"
300,19,710,"Prince of the people.” He replied: “Shall thy command assuage,"
300,19,711,"Gulf - fed Scamander, my free wrath? I’ll never leave pursu’d"
300,19,712,"Proud Ilion’s slaughters, till this hand in her fill’d walls conclude"
300,19,713,"Her flying forces, and hath tried in single fight the chance"
300,19,714,Of war with Hector; whose event with stark death shall advance
300,19,715,One of our conquests.” Thus again he like a fury flew
300,19,716,Upon the Trojans; when the flood his sad plaint did pursue
300,19,717,"To bright Apollo, telling him he was too negligent"
300,19,718,"Of Jove’s high charge, importuning by all means vehement"
300,19,719,His help of Troy till latest even should her black shadows pour
300,19,720,"On Earth’s broad breast. In all his worst, Achilles yet from shore"
300,19,721,"Leapt to his midst. Then swell’d his waves, then rag’d, then boil’d"
300,19,722,again
300,19,723,"Against Achilles. Up flew all, and all the bodies slain"
300,19,724,In all his deeps (of which the heaps made bridges to his waves)
300,19,725,"He belch’d out, roaring like a bull. The unslain yet he saves"
300,19,726,In his black whirlpits vast and deep. A horrid billow stood
300,19,727,About Achilles. On his shield the violence of the Flood
300,19,728,"Beat so, it drave him back, and took his feet up, his fair palm"
300,19,729,"Enforc’d to catch into his stay a broad and lofty elm,"
300,19,730,"Whose roots he toss’d up with his hold, and tore up all the shore."
300,19,731,"With this then he repell’d the waves, and those thick arms it bore"
300,19,732,He made a bridge to bear him off; (for all fell in) when he
300,19,733,Forth from the channel threw himself. The rage did terrify[3]
300,19,734,"Ev’n his great spirit, and made him add wings to his swiftest feet,"
300,19,735,"And tread the land. And yet not there the Flood left his retreat,"
300,19,736,"But thrust his billows after him, and black’d them all at top,"
300,19,737,"To make him fear, and fly his charge, and set the broad field ope"
300,19,738,"For Troy to ’scape in. He sprung out a dart’s cast, but came on"
300,19,739,"Again with a redoubled force. As when the swiftest flown,"
300,19,740,"And strong’st of all fowls, Jove’s black hawk, the huntress, stoops"
300,19,741,upon
300,19,742,A much lov’d quarry; so charg’d he; his arms with horror rung
300,19,743,"Against the black waves. Yet again he was so urg’d, he flung"
300,19,744,"His body from the Flood, and fled; and after him again"
300,19,745,"The waves flew roaring. As a man that finds a water - vein,"
300,19,746,And from some black fount is to bring his streams through plants and
300,19,747,"groves,"
300,19,748,"Goes with his mattock, and all checks, set to his course, removes;"
300,19,749,"When that runs freely, under it the pebbles all give way,"
300,19,750,"And, where it finds a fall, runs swift; nor can the leader stay"
300,19,751,"His current then, before himself full - pac’d it murmurs on;"
300,19,752,So of Achilles evermore the strong Flood vantage won;
300,19,753,"Though most deliver, Gods are still above the pow’rs of men."
300,19,754,As oft as th’ able god - like man endeavour’d to maintain
300,19,755,"His charge on them that kept the flood, and charg’d as he would try"
300,19,756,If all the Gods inhabiting the broad unreachéd sky
300,19,757,"Could daunt his spirit; so oft still, the rude waves charg’d him round,"
300,19,758,Rampt on his shoulders; from whose depth his strength and spirit would
300,19,759,bound
300,19,760,"Up to the free air, vex’d in soul. And now the vehement Flood"
300,19,761,"Made faint his knees; so overthwart his waves were, they withstood"
300,19,762,"All the denied dust, which he wish’d, and now was fain to cry,"
300,19,763,"Casting his eyes to that broad heav’n, that late he long’d to try,"
300,19,764,"And said: “O Jove, how am I left! No God vouchsafes to free"
300,19,765,"Me, miserable man. Help now, and after torture me"
300,19,766,"With any outrage. Would to heaven, Hector, the mightiest"
300,19,767,"Bred in this region, had imbru’d his jav’lin in my breast,"
300,19,768,That strong may fall by strong! Where now weak water’s luxury
300,19,769,"Must make my death blush, one, heav’n - born, shall like a hog - herd die,"
300,19,770,Drown’d in a dirty torrent’s rage. Yet none of you in heav’n
300,19,771,"I blame for this, but She alone by whom this life was giv’n"
300,19,772,"That now must die thus. She would still delude me with her tales,"
300,19,773,Affirming Phœbus’ shafts should end within the Trojan walls
300,19,774,"My curs’d beginning.” In this strait, Neptune and Pallas flew,"
300,19,775,"To fetch him off. In men’s shapes both close to his danger drew,"
300,19,776,"And, taking both both hands, thus spake the Shaker of the world:"
300,19,777,"“Pelides, do not stir a foot, nor these waves, proudly curl’d"
300,19,778,"Against thy bold breast, fear a jot; thou hast us two thy friends,"
300,19,779,"Neptune and Pallas, Jove himself approving th’ aid we lend."
300,19,780,’Tis nothing as thou fear’st with Fate; she will not see thee drown’d.
300,19,781,"This height shall soon down, thine own eyes shall see it set aground."
300,19,782,"Be rul’d then, we’ll advise thee well; take not thy hand away"
300,19,783,"From putting all, indiff’rently, to all that it can lay"
300,19,784,"Upon the Trojans, till the walls of haughty Ilion"
300,19,785,Conclude all in a desp’rate flight. And when thou hast set gone
300,19,786,"The soul of Hector, turn to fleet; our hands shall plant a wreath"
300,19,787,Of endless glory on thy brows.” Thus to the free from death
300,19,788,"Both made retreat. He, much impell’d by charge the Godheads gave,"
300,19,789,"The field, that now was overcome with many a boundless wave,"
300,19,790,"He overcame. On their wild breasts they toss’d the carcasses,"
300,19,791,"And arms, of many a slaughter’d man. And now the wingéd knees"
300,19,792,Of this great captain bore aloft; against the Flood he flies
300,19,793,With full assault; nor could that God make shrink his rescu’d thighs.
300,19,794,"Nor shrunk the Flood, but, as his foe grew pow’rful, he grew mad,"
300,19,795,"Thrust up a billow to the sky, and crystal Simoïs bad"
300,19,796,"To his assistance: “Simoïs, ho, brother,” out he cried,"
300,19,797,"“Come, add thy current, and resist this man half - deified,"
300,19,798,Or Ilion he will pull down straight; the Trojans cannot stand
300,19,799,"A minute longer. Come, assist, and instantly command"
300,19,800,"All fountains in thy rule to rise, all torrents to make in,"
300,19,801,"And stuff thy billows; with whose height, engender such a din,"
300,19,802,"With trees torn up and justling stones, as so immane a man"
300,19,803,May shrink beneath us; whose pow’r thrives do my pow’r all it can;
300,19,804,"He dares things fitter for a God. But, nor his form, nor force,"
300,19,805,"Nor glorious arms shall profit it; all which, and his dead corse,"
300,19,806,"I vow to roll up in my sands, nay, bury in my mud,"
300,19,807,"Nay, in the very sinks of Troy, that, pour’d into my flood,"
300,19,808,"Shall make him drowning work enough; and, being drown’d, I’ll set"
300,19,809,"A fort of such strong filth on him, that Greece shall never get"
300,19,810,"His bones from it. There, there shall stand Achilles’ sepulchre,"
300,19,811,And save a burial for his friends.” This fury did transfer
300,19,812,"His high - ridg’d billows on the prince, roaring with blood and foam"
300,19,813,And carcasses. The crimson stream did snatch into her womb
300,19,814,"Surpris’d Achilles; and her height stood, held up by the hand"
300,19,815,"Of Jove himself. Then Juno cried, and call’d (to countermand"
300,19,816,"This wat’ry Deity) the God that holds command in fire,"
300,19,817,Afraid lest that gulf - stomach’d Flood would satiate his desire
300,19,818,"On great Achilles: “Mulciber, my best lov’d son!” she cried,"
300,19,819,"“Rouse thee, for all the Gods conceive this Flood thus amplified"
300,19,820,"Is rais’d at thee, and shows as if his waves would drown the sky,"
300,19,821,"And put out all the sphere of fire. Haste, help thy empery."
300,19,822,Light flames deep as his pits. Ourself the west wind and the south
300,19,823,"Will call out of the sea, and breathe in either’s full - charg’d mouth"
300,19,824,A storm t’ enrage thy fires ’gainst Troy; which shall (in one exhal’d)
300,19,825,"Blow flames of sweat about their brows, and make their armours scald."
300,19,826,"Go thou then, and, ’gainst these winds rise, make work on Xanthus’"
300,19,827,"shore,"
300,19,828,"With setting all his trees on fire, and in his own breast pour"
300,19,829,A fervor that shall make it burn; nor let fair words or threats
300,19,830,"Avert thy fury till I speak, and then subdue the heats"
300,19,831,"Of all thy blazes.” Mulciber prepar’d a mighty fire,"
300,19,832,First in the field us’d; burning up the bodies that the ire
300,19,833,"Of great Achilles reft of souls; the quite - drown’d field it dried,"
300,19,834,"And shrunk the flood up. And as fields, that have been long time cloy’d"
300,19,835,"With catching weather, when their corn lies on the gavel heap,"
300,19,836,"Are with a constant north wind dried, with which for comfort leap"
300,19,837,"Their hearts that sow’d them; so this field was dried, the bodies"
300,19,838,"burn’d,"
300,19,839,And ev’n the flood into a fire as bright as day was turn’d.
300,19,840,"Elms, willows, tam’risks, were inflam’d; the lote trees, sea - grass"
300,19,841,"reeds,"
300,19,842,"And rushes, with the galingale roots, of which abundance breeds"
300,19,843,"About the sweet flood, all were fir’d; the gliding fishes flew"
300,19,844,Upwards in flames; the grov’lling eels crept upright; all which slew
300,19,845,Wise Vulcan’s unresisted spirit. The Flood out of a flame
300,19,846,"Cried to him: “Cease, O Mulciber, no Deity can tame"
300,19,847,"Thy matchless virtue; nor would I, since thou art thus hot, strive."
300,19,848,"Cease then thy strife; let Thetis’ son, with all thy wish’d haste,"
300,19,849,drive
300,19,850,"Ev’n to their gates these Ilians. What toucheth me their aid,"
300,19,851,Or this contention?” Thus in flames the burning River pray’d.
300,19,852,"And as a caldron, underput with store of fire, and wrought"
300,19,853,"With boiling of a well - fed brawn, up leaps his wave aloft,"
300,19,854,"Bavins of sere wood urging it, and spending flames apace,"
300,19,855,Till all the caldron be engirt with a consuming blaze;
300,19,856,"So round this Flood burn’d, and so sod his sweet and tortur’d streams,"
300,19,857,"Nor could flow forth, bound in the fumes of Vulcan’s fi’ry beams;"
300,19,858,"Who, then not mov’d, his mother’s ruth by all his means he craves,"
300,19,859,"And ask’d, why Vulcan should invade and so torment his waves"
300,19,860,"Past other floods, when his offence rose not to such degree"
300,19,861,As that of other Gods for Troy; and that himself would free
300,19,862,"Her wrath to it, if she were pleas’d; and pray’d her, that her son"
300,19,863,"Might be reflected; adding this, that he would ne’er be won"
300,19,864,"To help keep off the ruinous day, in which all Troy should burn,"
300,19,865,"Fir’d by the Grecians. This vow heard, she charg’d her son to turn"
300,19,866,"His fi’ry spirits to their homes, and said it was not fit"
300,19,867,A God should suffer so for men. Then Vulcan did remit
300,19,868,"His so unmeasur’d violence, and back the pleasant Flood"
300,19,869,Ran to his channel. Thus these Gods she made friends; th’ other stood
300,19,870,"At weighty diff’rence; both sides ran together with a sound,"
300,19,871,"That earth resounded, and great heav’n about did surrebound,"
300,19,872,"Jove heard it, sitting on his hill, and laugh’d to see the Gods"
300,19,873,"Buckle to arms like angry men; and, he pleas’d with their odds,"
300,19,874,"They laid it freely. Of them all, thump - buckler Mars began,"
300,19,875,"And at Minerva with a lance of brass he headlong ran,"
300,19,876,"These vile words ushering his blows: “Thou dog - fly, what’s the cause"
300,19,877,Thou mak’st Gods fight thus? Thy huge heart breaks all our peaceful
300,19,878,laws
300,19,879,"With thy insatiate shamelessness, Rememb’rest thou the hour"
300,19,880,"When Diomed charg’d me, and by thee, and thou with all thy pow’r"
300,19,881,"Took’st lance thyself, and, in all sights, rush’d on me with a wound?"
300,19,882,"Now vengeance falls on thee for all.” This said, the shield fring’d"
300,19,883,round
300,19,884,"With fighting adders, borne by Jove, that not to thunder yields,"
300,19,885,"He clapt his lance on; and this God, that with the blood of fields"
300,19,886,"Pollutes his godhead, that shield pierc’d, and hurt the arméd Maid,"
300,19,887,"But back she leapt, and with her strong hand rapt a huge stone, laid"
300,19,888,"Above the champain, black and sharp, that did in old time break"
300,19,889,Partitions to men’s lands; and that she dusted in the neck
300,19,890,"Of that impetuous challenger. Down to the earth he sway’d,"
300,19,891,And overlaid sev’n acres’ land. His hair was all beray’d
300,19,892,"With dust and blood mix’d; and his arms rung out. Minerva laugh’d,"
300,19,893,"And thus insulted: “O thou fool, yet hast thou not been taught"
300,19,894,To know mine eminence? Thy strength opposest thou to mine?
300,19,895,"So pay thy mother’s furies then, who for these aids of thine,"
300,19,896,"(Ever afforded perjur’d Troy, Greece ever left) takes spleen,"
300,19,897,"And vows thee mischief.” Thus she turn’d her blue eyes, when love’s"
300,19,898,Queen
300,19,899,"The hand of Mars took, and from earth rais’d him with thick - drawn"
300,19,900,"breath,"
300,19,901,His spirits not yet got up again. But from the press of death
300,19,902,"Kind Aphrodite was his guide. Which Juno seeing, exclaim’d:"
300,19,903,"“Pallas, see, Mars is help’d from field! Dog - fly, his rude tongue nam’d"
300,19,904,"Thyself ev’n now; but that his love, that dog - fly, will not leave"
300,19,905,Her old consort. Upon her fly.” Minerva did receive
300,19,906,"This excitation joyfully, and at the Cyprian flew,"
300,19,907,"Strook with her hard hand her soft breast, a blow that overthrew"
300,19,908,Both her and Mars; and there both lay together in broad field.
300,19,909,"When thus she triumph’d: “So lie all, that any succours yield"
300,19,910,To these false Trojans ’gainst the Greeks; so bold and patient
300,19,911,"As Venus, shunning charge of me; and no less impotent"
300,19,912,"Be all their aids, than hers to Mars. So short work would be made"
300,19,913,"In our depopulating Troy, this hardiest to invade"
300,19,914,"Of all earth’s cities.” At this wish, white - wristed Juno smil’d."
300,19,915,"Next Neptune and Apollo stood upon the point of field,"
300,19,916,"And thus spake Neptune: “Phœbus! Come, why at the lance’s end"
300,19,917,"Stand we two thus? ’Twill be a shame, for us to re - ascend"
300,19,918,"Jove’s golden house, being thus in field and not to fight. Begin;"
300,19,919,"For ’tis no graceful work for me; thou hast the younger chin,"
300,19,920,"I older and know more. O fool, what a forgetful heart"
300,19,921,"Thou bear’st about thee, to stand here, prest to take th’ Ilian part,"
300,19,922,"And fight with me! Forgett’st thou then, what we two, we alone"
300,19,923,"Of all the Gods, have suffer’d here, when proud Laomedon"
300,19,924,"Enjoy’d our service a whole year, for our agreed reward?"
300,19,925,Jove in his sway would have it so; and in that year I rear’d
300,19,926,"This broad brave wall about this town, that (being a work of mine)"
300,19,927,"It might be inexpugnable. This service then was thine,"
300,19,928,"In Ida, that so many hills and curl’d - head forests crown,"
300,19,929,"To feed his oxen, crooked - shank’d, and headed like the moon."
300,19,930,"But when the much - joy - bringing Hours brought term for our reward,"
300,19,931,"The terrible Laomedon dismiss’d us both, and scar’d"
300,19,932,"Our high deservings, not alone to hold our promis’d fee,"
300,19,933,"But give us threats too. Hands and feet he swore to fetter thee,"
300,19,934,"And sell thee as a slave, dismiss’d far hence to foreign isles."
300,19,935,"Nay more, he would have both our ears. His vow’s breach, and reviles,"
300,19,936,Made us part angry with him then; and dost thou gratulate now
300,19,937,"Such a king’s subjects? Or with us not their destruction vow,"
300,19,938,Ev’n to their chaste wives and their babes?” He answer’d: “He might
300,19,939,"hold,"
300,19,940,"His wisdom little, if with him, a God, for men he would"
300,19,941,Maintain contention; wretched men that flourish for a time
300,19,942,"Like leaves, eat some of that earth yields, and give earth in their"
300,19,943,prime
300,19,944,"Their whole selves for it. Quickly then, let us fly fight for them,"
300,19,945,Nor show it offer’d. Let themselves bear out their own extreme.”
300,19,946,"Thus he retir’d, and fear’d to change blows with his uncle’s hands;"
300,19,947,"His sister therefore chid him much, the Goddess that commands"
300,19,948,"In games of hunting, and thus spake: “Fly’st thou, and leav’st the"
300,19,949,field
300,19,950,"To Neptune’s glory, and no blows? O fool, why dost thou wield"
300,19,951,Thy idle bow? No more my ears shall hear thee vaunt in skies
300,19,952,"Dares to meet Neptune, but I’ll tell thy coward’s tongue it lies.”"
300,19,953,"He answer’d nothing; yet Jove’s wife could put on no such reins,"
300,19,954,"But spake thus loosely: “How dar’st thou, dog, whom no fear contains,"
300,19,955,Encounter me? ’Twill prove a match of hard conditión.
300,19,956,Though the great Lady of the bow and Jove hath set thee down
300,19,957,"For lion of thy sex, with gift to slaughter any dame"
300,19,958,Thy proud will envies; yet some dames will prove th’ had’st better tame
300,19,959,Wild lions upon hills than them. But if this question rests
300,19,960,"Yet under judgment in thy thoughts, and that thy mind contests,"
300,19,961,I’ll make thee know it.” Suddenly with her left hand she catch’d
300,19,962,"Both Cynthia’s palms, lock’d fingers fast, and with her right she"
300,19,963,snatch’d
300,19,964,"From her fair shoulders her gilt bow, and, laughing, laid it on"
300,19,965,"About her ears, and ev’ry way her turnings seiz’d upon,"
300,19,966,"Till all her arrows scatter’d out, her quiver emptied quite."
300,19,967,"And as a dove, that, flying a hawk, takes to some rock her flight,"
300,19,968,"And in his hollow breasts sits safe, her fate not yet to die;"
300,19,969,"So fled she mourning, and her bow left there. Then Mercury"
300,19,970,"His opposite thus undertook: “Latona, at no hand"
300,19,971,Will I bide combat. ’Tis a work right dangerous to stand
300,19,972,"At diff’rence with the wives of Jove. Go, therefore, freely vaunt"
300,19,973,"Amongst the Deities, th’ hast subdu’d, and made thy combatant"
300,19,974,"Yield with plain pow’r.” She answer’d not, but gather’d up the bow"
300,19,975,"And shafts fall’n from her daughter’s side, retiring. Up did go"
300,19,976,"Diana to Jove’s starry hall, her incorrupted veil"
300,19,977,"Trembling about her so she shook. Phœbus, lest Troy should fail"
300,19,978,"Before her fate, flew to her walls; the other Deities flew"
300,19,979,"Up to Olympus, some enrag’d, some glad. Achilles slew"
300,19,980,Both men and horse of Ilion. And as a city fir’d
300,19,981,"Casts up a heat that purples heav’n, clamours and shrieks expir’d"
300,19,982,"In ev’ry corner, toil to all, to many misery,"
300,19,983,Which fire th’ incenséd Gods let fall; Achilles so let fly
300,19,984,"Rage on the Trojans, toils and shrieks as much by him impos’d."
300,19,985,"Old Priam in his sacred tow’r stood, and the flight disclos’d"
300,19,986,"Of his forc’d people, all in rout, and not a stroke return’d"
300,19,987,By fled resistance. His eyes saw in what a fury burn’d
300,19,988,"The son of Peleüs, and down went weeping from the tow’r"
300,19,989,"To all the port - guards, and their chiefs told of his flying pow’r."
300,19,990,"Commanding th’ op’ning of the ports, but not to let their hands"
300,19,991,"Stir from them, for Æacides would pour in with his bands."
300,19,992,"“Destruction comes, O shut them strait, when we are in,” he pray’d,"
300,19,993,"“For not our walls I fear will check this violent man.” This said,"
300,19,994,"Off lifted they the bars, the ports hal’d open, and they gave"
300,19,995,"Safety her entry with the host; which yet they could not save,"
300,19,996,"Had not Apollo sallied out, and strook destructión,"
300,19,997,"Brought by Achilles in their necks, back; when they right upon"
300,19,998,"The ports bore all, dry, dusty, spent; and on their shoulders rode"
300,19,999,"Rabid Achilles with his lance, still glory being the goad"
300,19,1000,That prick’d his fury. Then the Greeks high - ported Ilion
300,19,1001,"Had seiz’d, had not Apollo stirr’d Antenor’s famous son,"
300,19,1002,"Divine Agenor, and cast in an undertaking spirit"
300,19,1003,"To his bold bosom, and himself stood by to strengthen it,"
300,19,1004,And keep the heavy hand of death from breaking in. The God
300,19,1005,"Stood by him, leaning on a beech, and cover’d his abode."
300,19,1006,"With night - like darkness; yet for all the spirit he inspir’d,"
300,19,1007,"When that great city - razer’s force his thoughts strook, he retir’d,"
300,19,1008,"Stood, and went on; a world of doubts still falling in his way;"
300,19,1009,"When, angry with himself, he said: “Why suffer I this stay"
300,19,1010,"In this so strong need to go on? If, like the rest, I fly,"
300,19,1011,"’Tis his best weapon to give chace, being swift, and I should die"
300,19,1012,"Like to a coward. If I stand, I fall too. These two ways"
300,19,1013,Please not my purpose; I would live. What if I suffer these
300,19,1014,"Still to be routed, and, my feet affording further length,"
300,19,1015,"Pass all these fields of Ilion, till Ida’s sylvan strength"
300,19,1016,"And steep heights shroud me, and at even refresh me in the flood,"
300,19,1017,And turn to Ilion? O my soul? why drown’st thou in the blood
300,19,1018,"Of these discourses? If this course, that talks of further flight,"
300,19,1019,"I give my feet, his feet more swift have more odds. Get he sight"
300,19,1020,"Of that pass, I pass least; for pace, and length of pace, his thighs"
300,19,1021,Will stand out all men. Meet him then; my steel hath faculties
300,19,1022,"Of pow’r to pierce him; his great breast but one soul holds, and that"
300,19,1023,"Death claims his right in, all men say; but he holds special state"
300,19,1024,"In Jove’s high bounty; that’s past man, that ev’ry way will hold,"
300,19,1025,And that serves all men ev’ry way.” This last heart made him bold
300,19,1026,"To stand Achilles, and stirr’d up a mighty mind to blows."
300,19,1027,"And as a panther, having heard the hounds’ trail, doth disclose"
300,19,1028,"Her freckled forehead, and stares forth from out some deep - grown wood"
300,19,1029,To try what strength dares her abroad; and when her fi’ry blood
300,19,1030,"The hounds have kindled, no quench serves of love to live or fear,"
300,19,1031,"Though strook, though wounded, though quite through she feels the"
300,19,1032,"mortal spear,"
300,19,1033,"But till the man’s close strength she tries, or strows earth with his"
300,19,1034,"dart,"
300,19,1035,"She puts her strength out; so it far’d with brave Agenor’s heart,"
300,19,1036,"And till Achilles he had prov’d, no thoughts, no deeds, once stirr’d"
300,19,1037,"His fixéd foot. To his broad breast his round shield he preferr’d,"
300,19,1038,"And up his arm went with his aim, his voice out with this cry:"
300,19,1039,"“Thy hope is too great, Peleus’ son, this day to show thine eye"
300,19,1040,"Troy’s Ilion at thy foot. O fool! the Greeks with much more woes,"
300,19,1041,"More than are suffer’d yet, must buy great Ilion’s overthrows."
300,19,1042,"We are within her many strong, that for our parents’ sakes,"
300,19,1043,"Our wives and children, will save Troy; and thou, though he that makes"
300,19,1044,"Thy name so terrible, shalt make a sacrifice to her"
300,19,1045,"With thine own ruins.” Thus he threw, nor did his jav’lin err,"
300,19,1046,But strook his foe’s leg near his knee; the fervent steel did ring
300,19,1047,"Against his tin greaves, and leapt back; the fire’s strong - handed king"
300,19,1048,Gave virtue of repulse. And then Æacides assail’d
300,19,1049,"Divine Agenor; but in vain, Apollo’s pow’r prevail’d,"
300,19,1050,And rapt Agenor from his reach; whom quietly he plac’d
300,19,1051,"Without the skirmish, casting mists to save from being chac’d"
300,19,1052,"His tender’d person; and (he gone) to give his soldiers ’scape,"
300,19,1053,"The Deity turn’d Achilles still, by putting on the shape"
300,19,1054,"Of him he thirsted; evermore he fed his eye, and fled,"
300,19,1055,"And he with all his knees pursu’d. So cunningly he led,"
300,19,1056,"That still he would be near his reach, to draw his rage, with hope,"
300,19,1057,Far from the conflict; to the flood maintaining still the scope
300,19,1058,"Of his attraction. In mean time, the other frighted pow’rs"
300,19,1059,"Came to the city, comforted; when Troy and all her tow’rs"
300,19,1060,"Strooted with fillers; none would stand to see who stay’d without,"
300,19,1061,"Who scap’d, and who came short. The ports cleft to receive the rout"
300,19,1062,That pour’d itself in. Ev’ry man was for himself. Most fleet
300,19,1063,"Most fortunate. Whoever scap’d, his head might thank his feet."

300,19,1070,THE TWENTY - SECOND BOOK OF HOMER’S ILIADS
300,19,1071,THE ARGUMENT
300,19,1072,"All Trojans hous’d but Hector, only he"
300,19,1073,"Keeps field, and undergoes th’ extremity."
300,19,1074,"Æacides assaulting, Hector flies,"
300,19,1075,"Minerva stays him, he resists, and dies."
300,19,1076,"Achilles to his chariot doth enforce,"
300,19,1077,And to the naval station drags his corse.
300,19,1078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,19,1079,"Hector, in Chi, to death is done,"
300,19,1080,By pow’r of Peleus’ angry son.
300,19,1081,"Thus, chas’d like hinds, the Ilians took time to drink and eat,"
300,19,1082,"And to refresh them, getting off the mingled dust and sweat,"
300,19,1083,And good strong rampires on instead. The Greeks then cast their shields
300,19,1084,Aloft their shoulders; and now Fate their near invasion yields
300,19,1085,"Of those tough walls, her deadly hand compelling Hector’s stay"
300,19,1086,Before Troy at the Scæan ports. Achilles still made way
300,19,1087,"At Phœbus, who his bright head turn’d, and ask’d: “Why, Peleus’ son,"
300,19,1088,"Pursu’st thou, being a man, a God? Thy rage hath never done."
300,19,1089,Acknowledge not thine eyes my state? Esteems thy mind no more
300,19,1090,"Thy honour in the chase of Troy, but puts my chase before"
300,19,1091,"Their utter conquest? They are all now hous’d in Ilion,"
300,19,1092,While thou hunt’st me. What wishest thou? My blood will never run
300,19,1093,"On thy proud jav’lin.” “It is thou,” replied Æacides,"
300,19,1094,"“That putt’st dishonour thus on me, thou worst of Deities."
300,19,1095,"Thou turn’dst me from the walls, whose ports had never entertain’d"
300,19,1096,"Numbers now enter’d, over whom thy saving hand hath reign’d,"
300,19,1097,"And robb’d my honour; and all is, since all thy actions stand"
300,19,1098,"Past fear of reck’ning. But held I the measure in my hand,"
300,19,1099,"It should afford thee dear - bought scapes.” Thus with elated spirits,"
300,19,1100,"Steed - like, that at Olympus’ games wears garlands for his merits,"
300,19,1101,"And rattles home his chariot, extending all his pride,"
300,19,1102,Achilles so parts with the God. When aged Priam spied
300,19,1103,"The great Greek come, spher’d round with beams and showing as if the"
300,19,1104,"star,"
300,19,1105,"Surnam’d Orion’s hound, that springs in autumn, and sends far"
300,19,1106,"His radiance through a world of stars, of all whose beams his own"
300,19,1107,"Cast greatest splendour, the midnight that renders them most shown"
300,19,1108,"Then being their foil; and on their points, cure - passing fevers then"
300,19,1109,Come shaking down into the joints of miserable men;
300,19,1110,"As this were fall’n to earth, and shot along the field his rays"
300,19,1111,"Now towards Priam, when he saw in great Æacides,"
300,19,1112,"Out flew his tender voice in shrieks, and with rais’d hands he smit"
300,19,1113,"His rev’rend head, then up to heav’n he cast them, showing it"
300,19,1114,"What plagues it sent him, down again then threw them to his son,"
300,19,1115,"To make him shun them. He now stood without steep Ilion,"
300,19,1116,Thirsting the combat; and to him thus miserably cried
300,19,1117,"The kind old king: “O Hector, fly this man, this homicide,"
300,19,1118,"That straight will stroy thee. He’s too strong, and would to heav’n he"
300,19,1119,were
300,19,1120,As strong in heav’n’s love as in mine! Vultures and dogs should tear
300,19,1121,"His prostrate carcass, all my woes quench’d with his bloody spirits."
300,19,1122,"He has robb’d me of many sons and worthy, and their merits"
300,19,1123,"Sold to far islands. Two of them, ah me! I miss but now,"
300,19,1124,"They are not enter’d, nor stay here. Laothoe, O ’twas thou,"
300,19,1125,"O queen of women, from whose womb they breath’d. O did the tents"
300,19,1126,"Detain them only, brass and gold would purchase safe events"
300,19,1127,"To their sad durance; ’tis within; old Altes, young in fame,"
300,19,1128,Gave plenty for his daughter’s dow’r; but if they fed the flame
300,19,1129,"Of this man’s fury, woe is me, woe to my wretched queen!"
300,19,1130,"But in our state’s woe their two deaths will nought at all be seen,"
300,19,1131,"So thy life quit them. Take the town, retire, dear son, and save"
300,19,1132,"Troy’s husbands and her wives, nor give thine own life to the grave"
300,19,1133,"For this man’s glory. Pity me, me, wretch, so long alive,"
300,19,1134,Whom in the door of age Jove keeps: that so he may deprive
300,19,1135,"My being, in fortune’s utmost curse, to see the blackest thread"
300,19,1136,"Of this life’s mis’ries, my sons slain, my daughters ravishéd,"
300,19,1137,"Their resting chambers sack’d, their babes, torn from them, on their"
300,19,1138,knees
300,19,1139,"Pleading for mercy, themselves dragg’d to Grecian slaveries,"
300,19,1140,"And all this drawn through my red eyes. Then last of all kneel I,"
300,19,1141,"Alone, all helpless at my gates, before my enemy,"
300,19,1142,"That ruthless gives me to my dogs, all the deformity"
300,19,1143,"Of age discover’d; and all this thy death, sought wilfully,"
300,19,1144,"Will pour on me. A fair young man at all parts it beseems,"
300,19,1145,"Being bravely slain, to lie all gash’d, and wear the worst extremes"
300,19,1146,"Of war’s most cruelty; no wound, of whatsoever ruth,"
300,19,1147,"But is his ornament; but I, a man so far from youth,"
300,19,1148,"White head, white - bearded, wrinkled, pin’d, all shames must show the"
300,19,1149,eye.
300,19,1150,"Live, prevent this then, this most shame of all man’s misery.”"
300,19,1151,"Thus wept the old king, and tore off his white hair; yet all these"
300,19,1152,"Retir’d not Hector. Hecuba then fell upon her knees,"
300,19,1153,"Stripp’d nak’d her bosom, show’d her breasts, and bad him rev’rence"
300,19,1154,"them,"
300,19,1155,"And pity her. If ever she had quieted his exclaim,"
300,19,1156,"He would cease hers, and take the town, not tempting the rude field"
300,19,1157,"When all had left it: “Think,” said she, ‘I gave thee life to yield"
300,19,1158,"My life recomfort; thy rich wife shall have no rites of thee,"
300,19,1159,"Nor do thee rites; our tears shall pay thy corse no obsequy,"
300,19,1160,"Being ravish’d from us, Grecian dogs nourish’d with what I nurs’d.”"
300,19,1161,"Thus wept both these, and to his ruth propos’d the utmost worst"
300,19,1162,Of what could chance them; yet he stay’d. And now drew deadly near
300,19,1163,Mighty Achilles; yet he still kept deadly station there.
300,19,1164,"Look how a dragon, when she sees a traveller bent upon"
300,19,1165,"Her breeding den, her bosom fed with full contagión,"
300,19,1166,"Gathers her forces, sits him firm, and at his nearest pace"
300,19,1167,"Wraps all her cavern in her folds, and thrusts a horrid face"
300,19,1168,"Out at his entry; Hector so, with unextinguish’d spirit,"
300,19,1169,"Stood great Achilles, stirr’d no foot, but at the prominent turret"
300,19,1170,"Bent to his bright shield, and resolv’d to bear fall’n heav’n on it."
300,19,1171,Yet all this resolute abode did not so truly fit
300,19,1172,His free election; but he felt a much more galling spur
300,19,1173,"To the performance, with conceit of what he should incur"
300,19,1174,"Ent’ring, like others, for this cause; to which he thus gave way:"
300,19,1175,"“O me, if I shall take the town, Polydamas will lay"
300,19,1176,This flight and all this death on me; who counsell’d me to lead
300,19,1177,"My pow’rs to Troy this last black night, when so I saw make head"
300,19,1178,"Incens’d Achilles. I yet stay’d, though, past all doubt, that course"
300,19,1179,Had much more profited than mine; which; being by so much worse
300,19,1180,"As comes to all our flight and death, my folly now I fear"
300,19,1181,"Hath bred this scandal, all our town now burns my ominous ear"
300,19,1182,With whisp’ring: ‘Hector’s self - conceit hath cast away his host.’
300,19,1183,"And, this true, this extremity that I rely on most"
300,19,1184,"Is best for me: stay, and retire with this man’s life; or die"
300,19,1185,"Here for our city with renown, since all else fled but I."
300,19,1186,And yet one way cuts both these ways: What if I hang my shield
300,19,1187,"My helm and lance here on these walls, and meet in humble field"
300,19,1188,"Renown’d Achilles, off’ring him Helen and all the wealth,"
300,19,1189,Whatever in his hollow keels bore Alexander’s stealth
300,19,1190,"For both th’ Atrides? For the rest, whatever is possess’d"
300,19,1191,"In all this city, known or hid, by oath shall be confess’d"
300,19,1192,"Of all our citizens; of which one half the Greeks shall have,"
300,19,1193,"One half themselves. But why, lov’d soul, would these suggestions save"
300,19,1194,"Thy state still in me? I’ll not sue; nor would he grant, but I,"
300,19,1195,"Mine arms cast off, should be assur’d a woman’s death to die."
300,19,1196,"To men of oak and rock, no words; virgins and youths talk thus,"
300,19,1197,Virgins and youths that love and woo; there’s other war with us;
300,19,1198,"What blows and conflicts urge, we cry, hates and defiances,"
300,19,1199,"And, with the garlands these trees bear, try which hand Jove will"
300,19,1200,bless.”
300,19,1201,"These thoughts employ’d his stay; and now Achilles comes, now near"
300,19,1202,"His Mars - like presence terribly came brandishing his spear,"
300,19,1203,"His right arm shook it, his bright arms like day came glitt’ring on,"
300,19,1204,"Like fire - light, or the light of heav’n shot from the rising sun,"
300,19,1205,"This sight outwrought discourse, cold fear shook Hector from his stand;"
300,19,1206,No more stay now; all ports were left; he fled in fear the hand
300,19,1207,"Of that Fear - Master; who, hawk - like, air’s swiftest passenger,"
300,19,1208,"That holds a tim’rous dove in chase, and with command doth bear"
300,19,1209,"His fi’ry onset, the dove hastes, the hawk comes whizzing on,"
300,19,1210,"This way and that he turns and winds, and cuffs the pigeón,"
300,19,1211,"And, till he truss it, his great spirit lays hot charge on his wing;"
300,19,1212,So urg’d Achilles Hector’s flight; so still fear’s point did sting
300,19,1213,"His troubled spirit, his knees wrought hard, along the wall he flew,"
300,19,1214,"In that fair chariot - way that runs, beneath the tow’r of view,"
300,19,1215,"And Troy’s wild fig - tree, till they reach’d where those two"
300,19,1216,mother - springs
300,19,1217,Of deep Scamander pour’d abroad their silver murmurings;
300,19,1218,"One warm and casts out fumes as fire; the other cold as snow,"
300,19,1219,"Or hail dissolv’d. And when the sun made ardent summer glow,"
300,19,1220,"There water’s concrete crystal shin’d; near which were cisterns made,"
300,19,1221,"All pav’d and clear, where Trojan wives and their fair daughters had"
300,19,1222,"Laundry for their fine linen weeds, in times of cleanly peace,"
300,19,1223,"Before the Grecians brought their siege. These captains noted these,"
300,19,1224,"One flying, th’ other in pursuit; a strong man flew before,"
300,19,1225,"A stronger follow’d him by far, and close up to him bore;"
300,19,1226,"Both did their best, for neither now ran for a sacrifice,"
300,19,1227,"Or for the sacrificer’s hide, our runners’ usual prize;"
300,19,1228,"These ran for tame - horse Hector’s soul. And as two running steeds,"
300,19,1229,"Back’d in some set race for a game, that tries their swiftest speeds,"
300,19,1230,"(A tripod, or a woman, giv’n for some man’s funerals)"
300,19,1231,"Such speed made these men, and on foot ran thrice about the walls.[1]"
300,19,1232,"The Gods beheld them, all much mov’d; and Jove said: “O ill sight!"
300,19,1233,"A man I love much, I see forc’d in most unworthy flight"
300,19,1234,"About great Ilion. My heart grieves; he paid so many vows,"
300,19,1235,"With thighs of sacrificéd beeves, both on the lofty brows"
300,19,1236,"Of Ida, and in Ilion’s height. Consult we, shall we free"
300,19,1237,"His life from death, or give it now t’ Achilles’ victory?”"
300,19,1238,Minerva answer’d: “Alter Fate? One long since mark’d for death?
300,19,1239,"Now take from death? Do thou; but know, he still shall run beneath"
300,19,1240,"Our other censures.” “Be it then,” replied the Thunderer,"
300,19,1241,"“My lov’d Tritonia, at thy will; in this I will prefer"
300,19,1242,"Thy free intention, work it all.” Then stoop’d She from the sky"
300,19,1243,To this great combat. Peleus’ son pursu’d incessantly
300,19,1244,"Still - flying Hector. As a hound that having rous’d a hart,"
300,19,1245,"Although he tappish ne’er so oft, and ev’ry shrubby part"
300,19,1246,"Attempts for strength, and trembles in, the hound doth still pursue"
300,19,1247,"So close that not a foot he fails, but hunts it still at view;"
300,19,1248,So plied Achilles Hector’s steps; as oft as he assay’d
300,19,1249,The Dardan ports and tow’rs for strength (to fetch from thence some aid
300,19,1250,"With wingéd shafts) so oft forc’d he amends of pace, and stept"
300,19,1251,"‘Twixt him and all his hopes, and still upon the field he kept"
300,19,1252,"His utmost turnings to the town. And yet, as in a dream,"
300,19,1253,"One thinks he gives another chase, when such a fain’d extreme"
300,19,1254,"Possesseth both, that he in chase the chaser cannot fly,"
300,19,1255,Nor can the chaser get to hand his flying enemy;[2]
300,19,1256,"So nor Achilles’ chase could reach the flight of Hector’s pace,"
300,19,1257,Nor Hector’s flight enlarge itself of swift Achilles’ chace.
300,19,1258,"But how chanc’d this? How, all this time, could Hector bear the knees"
300,19,1259,"Of fierce Achilles with his own, and keep off destinies,"
300,19,1260,"If Phœbus, for his last and best, through all that course had fail’d"
300,19,1261,"To add his succours to his nerves, and, as his foe assail’d"
300,19,1262,"Near and within him, fed his ’scape? Achilles yet well knew"
300,19,1263,"His knees would fetch him, and gave signs to some friends (making shew"
300,19,1264,"Of shooting at him) to forbear, lest they detracted so"
300,19,1265,"From his full glory in first wounds, and in the overthrow"
300,19,1266,Make his hand last. But when they reach’d the fourth time the two
300,19,1267,"founts,"
300,19,1268,"Then Jove his golden scales weigh’d up, and took the last accounts"
300,19,1269,"Of fate for Hector, putting in for him and Peleus’ son"
300,19,1270,"Two fates of bitter death; of which high heav’n receiv’d the one,"
300,19,1271,The other hell; so low declin’d the light of Hector’s life.
300,19,1272,"Then Phœbus left him, when war’s Queen came to resolve the strife"
300,19,1273,"In th’ other’s knowledge: “Now,” said she, “Jove - lov’d Æacides,"
300,19,1274,I hope at last to make renown perform a brave access
300,19,1275,"To all the Grecians; we shall now lay low this champion’s height,"
300,19,1276,Though never so insatiate was his great heart of fight.
300,19,1277,"Nor must he ’scape our púrsuit still, though at the feet of Jove"
300,19,1278,"Apollo bows into a sphere, soliciting more love"
300,19,1279,"To his most favour’d. Breathe thee then, stand firm, myself will haste"
300,19,1280,"And hearten Hector to change blows.” She went, and he stood fast,"
300,19,1281,"Lean’d on his lance, and much was joy’d that single strokes should try"
300,19,1282,This fadging conflict. Then came close the changéd Deity
300,19,1283,"To Hector, like Deiphobus in shape and voice, and said:"
300,19,1284,"“O brother, thou art too much urg’d to be thus combated"
300,19,1285,"About our own walls; let us stand, and force to a retreat"
300,19,1286,"Th’ insulting chaser.” Hector joy’d at this so kind deceit,"
300,19,1287,"And said: “O good Deiphobus, thy love was most before"
300,19,1288,"(Of all my brothers) dear to me, but now exceeding more"
300,19,1289,"It costs me honour, that, thus urg’d, thou com’st to part the charge"
300,19,1290,"Of my last fortunes; other friends keep town, and leave at large"
300,19,1291,"My rack’d endeavours.” She replied: “Good brother, ’tis most true,"
300,19,1292,"One after other, king and queen, and all our friends, did sue,"
300,19,1293,"Ev’n on their knees, to stay me there, such tremblings shake them all"
300,19,1294,With this man’s terror; but my mind so griev’d to see our wall
300,19,1295,"Girt with thy chases, that to death I long’d to urge thy stay."
300,19,1296,"Come, fight we, thirsty of his blood; no more let’s fear to lay"
300,19,1297,"Cost on our lances, but approve, if, bloodied with our spoils,"
300,19,1298,"He can bear glory to their fleet, or shut up all their toils"
300,19,1299,"In his one suff’rance on thy lance.” With this deceit she led,"
300,19,1300,"And, both come near, thus Hector spake: “Thrice have I compasséd"
300,19,1301,"This great town, Peleus’ son, in flight, with aversation"
300,19,1302,"That out of fate put off my steps; but now all flight is flown,"
300,19,1303,"The short course set up, death or life. Our resolutions yet"
300,19,1304,"Must shun all rudeness, and the Gods before our valour set"
300,19,1305,For use of victory; and they being worthiest witnesses
300,19,1306,"Of all vows, since they keep vows best, before their Deities"
300,19,1307,"Let vows of fit respect pass both, when conquest hath bestow’d"
300,19,1308,"Her wreath on either. Here I vow no fury shall be show’d,"
300,19,1309,"That is not manly, on thy corse, but, having spoil’d thy arms,"
300,19,1310,Resign thy person; which swear thou.” These fair and temp’rate terms
300,19,1311,"Far fled Achilles; his brows bent, and out flew this reply:"
300,19,1312,"“Hector, thou only pestilence in all mortality"
300,19,1313,"To my sere spirits, never set the point ’twixt thee and me"
300,19,1314,Any conditions; but as far as men and lions fly
300,19,1315,"All terms of cov’nant, lambs and wolves; in so far opposite state,"
300,19,1316,"Impossible for love t’ atone, stand we, till our souls satiate"
300,19,1317,The God of soldiers. Do not dream that our disjunction can
300,19,1318,"Endure condition. Therefore now, all worth that fits a man"
300,19,1319,"Call to thee, all particular parts that fit a soldier,"
300,19,1320,And they all this include (besides the skill and spirit of war)
300,19,1321,"Hunger for slaughter, and a hate that eats thy heart to eat"
300,19,1322,"Thy foe’s heart. This stirs, this supplies in death the killing heat;"
300,19,1323,And all this need’st thou. No more flight. Pallas Athenia
300,19,1324,"Will quickly cast thee to my lance. Now, now together draw"
300,19,1325,"All griefs for vengeance, both in me, and all my friends late dead"
300,19,1326,"That bled thee, raging with thy lance.” This said, he brandishéd"
300,19,1327,"His long lance, and away it sung; which Hector giving view,"
300,19,1328,"Stoop’d low, stood firm, foreseeing it best, and quite it overflew,"
300,19,1329,"Fast’ning on earth. Athenia drew it, and gave her friend,"
300,19,1330,"Unseen of Hector. Hector then thus spake: “Thou want’st thy end,"
300,19,1331,"God - like Achilles. Now I see, thou hast not learn’d my fate"
300,19,1332,"Of Jove at all, as thy high words would bravely intimate."
300,19,1333,Much tongue affects thee. Cunning words well serve thee to prepare
300,19,1334,"Thy blows with threats, that mine might faint with want of spirit to"
300,19,1335,dare.
300,19,1336,But my back never turns with breath; it was not born to bear
300,19,1337,"Burthens of wounds; strike home before; drive at my breast thy spear,"
300,19,1338,"As mine at thine shall, and try then if heav’n’s will favour thee"
300,19,1339,"With scape of my lance. O would Jove would take it after me,"
300,19,1340,And make thy bosom take it all! An easy end would crown
300,19,1341,"Our difficult wars, were thy soul fled, thou most bane of our town.”"
300,19,1342,"Thus flew his dart, touch’d at the midst of his black shield, and flew"
300,19,1343,A huge way from it; but his heart wrath enter’d with the view
300,19,1344,"Of that hard scape, and heavy thoughts strook through him, when he"
300,19,1345,spied
300,19,1346,"His brother vanish’d, and no lance beside left; out he cried:"
300,19,1347,"“Deiphobus, another lance.” Lance nor Deiphobus"
300,19,1348,"Stood near his call. And then his mind saw all things ominous,"
300,19,1349,"And thus suggested: “Woe is me, the Gods have call’d, and I"
300,19,1350,Must meet death here! Deiphobus I well hop’d had been by
300,19,1351,"With his white shield; but our strong walls shield him, and this deceit"
300,19,1352,"Flows from Minerva. Now, O now, ill death comes, no more flight,"
300,19,1353,"No more recovery. O Jove, this hath been otherwise;"
300,19,1354,Thy bright son and thyself have set the Greeks a greater prize
300,19,1355,"Of Hector’s blood than now; of which, ev’n jealous, you had care,"
300,19,1356,But Fate now conquers; I am hers; and yet not she shall share
300,19,1357,"In my renown; that life is left to every noble spirit,"
300,19,1358,And that some great deed shall beget that all lives shall inherit.”
300,19,1359,"Thus, forth his sword flew, sharp and broad, and bore a deadly weight,"
300,19,1360,With which he rush’d in. And look how an eagle from her height
300,19,1361,"Stoops to the rapture of a lamb, or cuffs a tim’rous hare;"
300,19,1362,So fell in Hector; and at him Achilles; his mind’s fare
300,19,1363,"Was fierce and mighty, his shield cast a sun - like radiance,"
300,19,1364,"Helm nodded, and his four plumes shook, and, when he rais’d his lance,"
300,19,1365,Up Hesp’rus rose ’mongst th’ evening stars. His bright and sparkling
300,19,1366,eyes
300,19,1367,"Look’d through the body of his foe, and sought through all that prise"
300,19,1368,"The next way to his thirsted life. Of all ways, only one"
300,19,1369,"Appear’d to him, and that was where th’ unequal winding bone,"
300,19,1370,"That joins the shoulders and the neck, had place, and where there lay"
300,19,1371,The speeding way to death; and there his quick eye could display
300,19,1372,"The place it sought, e’en through those arms his friend Patroclus wore"
300,19,1373,"When Hector slew him. There he aim’d, and there his jav’lin tore"
300,19,1374,Stern passage quite through Hector’s neck; yet miss’d it so his throat
300,19,1375,It gave him pow’r to change some words; but down to earth it got
300,19,1376,His fainting body. Then triumph’d divine Æacides:
300,19,1377,"“Hector,” said he, “thy heart suppos’d that in my friend’s decease"
300,19,1378,Thy life was safe; my absent arm not car’d for. Fool! he left
300,19,1379,"One at the fleet that better’d him, and he it is that reft"
300,19,1380,Thy strong knees thus; and now the dogs and fowls in foulest use
300,19,1381,"Shall tear thee up, thy corse expos’d to all the Greeks’ abuse.”"
300,19,1382,"He, fainting, said: “Let me implore, ev’n by thy knees and soul,"
300,19,1383,"And thy great parents, do not see a cruelty so foul"
300,19,1384,"Inflicted on me. Brass and gold receive at any rate,"
300,19,1385,"And quit my person, that the peers and ladies of our state"
300,19,1386,"May tomb it, and to sacred fire turn thy profane decrees.”"
300,19,1387,"“Dog,” he replied, “urge not my ruth, by parents, soul, nor knees."
300,19,1388,"I would to God that any rage would let me eat thee raw,"
300,19,1389,"Slic’d into pieces, so beyond the right of any law"
300,19,1390,"I taste thy merits! And, believe, it flies the force of man"
300,19,1391,"To rescue thy head from the dogs. Give all the gold they can,"
300,19,1392,If ten or twenty times so much as friends would rate thy price
300,19,1393,"Were tender’d here, with vows of more, to buy the cruelties"
300,19,1394,"I here have vow’d, and after that thy father with his gold"
300,19,1395,Would free thyself; all that should fail to let thy mother hold
300,19,1396,"Solemnities of death with thee, and do thee such a grace"
300,19,1397,To mourn thy whole corse on a bed; which piecemeal I’ll deface
300,19,1398,"With fowls and dogs.” He, dying, said: “I, knowing thee well, foresaw"
300,19,1399,"Thy now tried tyranny, nor hop’d for any other law,"
300,19,1400,"Of nature, or of nations; and that fear forc’d much more"
300,19,1401,"Than death my flight, which never touch’d at Hector’s foot before."
300,19,1402,"A soul of iron informs thee. Mark, what vengeance th’ equal fates"
300,19,1403,"Will give me of thee for this rage, when in the Scæan gates"
300,19,1404,"Phœbus and Paris meet with thee.” Thus death’s hand clos’d his eyes,"
300,19,1405,"His soul flying his fair limbs to hell, mourning his destinies,"
300,19,1406,"To part so with his youth and strength. Thus dead, thus Thetis’ son"
300,19,1407,"His prophecy answer’d: “Die thou now. When my short thread is spun,"
300,19,1408,"I’ll bear it as the will of Jove.” This said, his brazen spear"
300,19,1409,"He drew, and stuck by; then his arms, that all embruéd were,"
300,19,1410,"He spoil’d his shoulders of. Then all the Greeks ran in to him,"
300,19,1411,"To see his person, and admir’d his terror - stirring limb;"
300,19,1412,Yet none stood by that gave no wound to his so goodly form;
300,19,1413,"When each to other said: “O Jove, he is not in the storm"
300,19,1414,"He came to fleet in with his fire, he handles now more soft.”"
300,19,1415,"“O friends,” said stern Æacides, “now that the Gods have brought"
300,19,1416,"This man thus down, I’ll freely say, he brought more bane to Greece"
300,19,1417,"Than all his aiders. Try we then, thus arm’d at ev’ry piece,"
300,19,1418,"And girding all Troy with our host, if now their hearts will leave"
300,19,1419,"Their city clear, her clear stay slain, and all their lives receive,"
300,19,1420,"Or hold yet, Hector being no more. But why use I a word"
300,19,1421,"Of any act but what concerns my friend? Dead, undeplor’d,"
300,19,1422,"Unsepulchred, he lies at fleet, unthought on! Never hour"
300,19,1423,"Shall make his dead state, while the quick enjoys me, and this pow’r"
300,19,1424,"To move these movers. Though in hell, men say, that such as die"
300,19,1425,"Oblivion seizeth, yet in hell in me shall Memory"
300,19,1426,"Hold all her forms still of my friend. Now, youths of Greece, to fleet"
300,19,1427,"Bear we this body, pæans sing, and all our navy greet"
300,19,1428,"With endless honour; we have slain Hector, the period"
300,19,1429,"Of all Troy’s glory, to whose worth all vow’d as to a God.”"
300,19,1430,"This said, a work not worthy him he set to; of both feet"
300,19,1431,"He bor’d the nerves through from the heel to th’ ankle, and then knit"
300,19,1432,"Both to his chariot with a thong of whitleather, his head[3]"
300,19,1433,"Trailing the centre. Up he got to chariot, where he laid"
300,19,1434,"The arms repurchas’d, and scourg’d on his horse that freely flew."
300,19,1435,"A whirlwind made of startled dust drave with them as they drew,"
300,19,1436,With which were all his black - brown curls knotted in heaps and fil’d.
300,19,1437,"And there lay Troy’s late Gracious, by Jupiter exil’d"
300,19,1438,"To all disgrace in his own land, and by his parents seen;"
300,19,1439,"When, like her son’s head, all with dust Troy’s miserable queen"
300,19,1440,"Distain’d her temples, plucking off her honour’d hair, and tore"
300,19,1441,"Her royal garments, shrieking out. In like kind Priam bore"
300,19,1442,"His sacred person, like a wretch that never saw good day,"
300,19,1443,"Broken with outcries. About both the people prostrate lay,"
300,19,1444,Held down with clamour; all the town veil’d with a cloud of tears.
300,19,1445,"Ilion, with all his tops on fire, and all the massacres,"
300,19,1446,"Left for the Greeks, could put on looks of no more overthrow"
300,19,1447,Than now fraid life. And yet the king did all their looks outshow.
300,19,1448,"The wretched people could not bear his sov’reign wretchedness,"
300,19,1449,"Plaguing himself so, thrusting out, and praying all the press"
300,19,1450,"To open him the Dardan ports, that he alone might fetch"
300,19,1451,"His dearest son in, and (all fil’d with tumbling) did beseech"
300,19,1452,"Each man by name, thus: “Lov’d friends, be you content, let me,"
300,19,1453,"Though much ye grieve, be that poor mean to our sad remedy"
300,19,1454,"Now in our wishes; I will go and pray this impious man,"
300,19,1455,"Author of horrors, making proof if age’s rev’rence can"
300,19,1456,Excite his pity. His own sire is old like me; and he
300,19,1457,"That got him to our griefs, perhaps, may, for my likeness, be"
300,19,1458,"Mean for our ruth to him. Alas, you have no cause of cares,"
300,19,1459,"Compar’d with me! I many sons, grac’d with their freshest years,"
300,19,1460,"Have lost by him, and all their deaths in slaughter of this one"
300,19,1461,(Afflicted man) are doubled. This will bitterly set gone
300,19,1462,My soul to hell. O would to heaven I could but hold him dead
300,19,1463,"In these pin’d arms, then tears on tears might fall, till all were shed"
300,19,1464,"In common fortune! Now amaze their natural course doth stop,"
300,19,1465,"And pricks a mad vein.” Thus he mourn’d, and with him all break ope"
300,19,1466,Their store of sorrows. The poor Queen amongst the women wept
300,19,1467,"Turn’d into anguish: “O my son,” she cried out, “why still kept"
300,19,1468,"Patient of horrors is my life, when thine is vanishéd?"
300,19,1469,"My days thou glorifi’dst, my nights rung of some honour’d deed"
300,19,1470,"Done by thy virtues, joy to me, profit to all our care."
300,19,1471,"All made a God of thee, and thou mad’st them all that they are,"
300,19,1472,"Now under fate, now dead.” These two thus vented as they could"
300,19,1473,There sorrow’s furnace; Hector’s wife not having yet been told
300,19,1474,So much as of his stay without. She in her chamber close
300,19,1475,"Sat at her loom; a piece of work, grac’d with a both sides’ gloss,"
300,19,1476,"Strew’d curiously with varied flowers, her pleasure was; her care,"
300,19,1477,"To heat a caldron for her lord, to bathe him turn’d from war,"
300,19,1478,"Of which she chief charge gave her maids. Poor dame, she little knew"
300,19,1479,How much her cares lack’d of his case! But now the clamour flew
300,19,1480,"Up to her turret; then she shook, her work fell from her hand,"
300,19,1481,"And up she started, call’d her maids, she needs must understand"
300,19,1482,"That ominous outcry: “Come,” said she, I hear through all this cry"
300,19,1483,My mother’s voice shriek; to my throat my heart bounds; ecstasy
300,19,1484,Utterly alters me; some fate is near the hapless sons
300,19,1485,Of fading Priam. Would to God my words’ suspicións
300,19,1486,"No ear had heard yet! O I fear, and that most heartily,"
300,19,1487,"That, with some stratagem, the son of Peleus hath put by"
300,19,1488,"The wall of Ilion my lord, and, trusty of his feet,"
300,19,1489,"Obtain’d the chase of him alone, and now the curious heat"
300,19,1490,Of his still desp’rate spirit is cool’d. It let him never keep
300,19,1491,"In guard of others; before all his violent foot must step,"
300,19,1492,"Or his place forfeited he held.” Thus fury - like she went,"
300,19,1493,"Two women, as she will’d, at hand; and made her quick ascent"
300,19,1494,"Up to the tow’r and press of men, her spirit in uproar. Round"
300,19,1495,"She cast her greedy eye, and saw her Hector slain, and bound"
300,19,1496,"T’ Achilles’ chariot, manlessly dragg’d to the Grecian fleet."
300,19,1497,"Black night strook through her, under her trance took away her feet,"
300,19,1498,"And back she shrunk with such a sway that off her head - tire flew,"
300,19,1499,"Her coronet, caul, ribands, veil that golden Venus threw"
300,19,1500,On her white shoulders that high day when warlike Hector won
300,19,1501,"Her hand in nuptials in the court of king Eetion,"
300,19,1502,"And that great dow’r then giv’n with her. About her, on their knees,"
300,19,1503,"Her husband’s sisters, brothers’ wives, fell round, and by degrees"
300,19,1504,"Recover’d her. Then, when again her respirations found"
300,19,1505,Free pass (her mind and spirit met) these thoughts her words did sound:
300,19,1506,"“O Hector, O me, curséd dame, both born beneath one fate,"
300,19,1507,"Thou here, I in Cilician Thebes, where Placus doth elate"
300,19,1508,"His shady forehead, in the court where king Eetion,"
300,19,1509,"Hapless, begot unhappy me; which would he had not done,"
300,19,1510,"To live past thee! Thou now art div’d to Pluto’s gloomy throne,"
300,19,1511,"Sunk through the coverts of the earth; I, in a hell of moan,"
300,19,1512,"Left here thy widow; one poor babe born to unhappy both,"
300,19,1513,"Whom thou leav’st helpless as he thee, he born to all the wroth"
300,19,1514,Of woe and labour. Lands left him will others seize upon;
300,19,1515,The orphan day of all friends’ helps robs ev’ry mother’s son.
300,19,1516,An orphan all men suffer sad; his eyes stand still with tears;
300,19,1517,"Need tries his father’s friends, and fails; of all his favourers,"
300,19,1518,"If one the cup gives, ’tis not long, the wine he finds in it"
300,19,1519,"Scarce moists his palate; if he chance to gain the grace to sit,"
300,19,1520,"Surviving fathers’ sons repine, use contumelies, strike,"
300,19,1521,"Bid, ‘leave us, where’s thy father’s place?’ He, weeping with dislike,"
300,19,1522,"Retires to me, to me, alas! Astyanax is he"
300,19,1523,"Born to these mis’ries; he that late fed on his father’s knee,"
300,19,1524,"To whom all knees bow’d, daintiest fare appos’d him; and when sleep"
300,19,1525,"Lay on his temples, his cries still’d, his heart ev’n laid in steep"
300,19,1526,"Of all things precious, a soft bed, a careful nurse’s arms,"
300,19,1527,Took him to guardiance. But now as huge a world of harms
300,19,1528,"Lies on his suff’rance; now thou want’st thy father’s hand to friend,"
300,19,1529,"O my Astyanax; O my lord, thy hand that did defend"
300,19,1530,"These gates of Ilion, these long walls by thy arm measur’d still"
300,19,1531,Amply and only. Yet at fleet thy naked corse must fill
300,19,1532,"Vile worms, when dogs are satiate, far from thy parents’ care,"
300,19,1533,Far from those fun’ral ornaments that thy mind would prepare
300,19,1534,(So sudden being the chance of arms) ever expecting death.
300,19,1535,"Which task, though my heart would not serve t’ employ my hands beneath,"
300,19,1536,"I made my women yet perform. Many, and much in price,"
300,19,1537,Were those integuments they wrought t’ adorn thy exsequies;
300,19,1538,"Which, since they fly thy use, thy corse not laid in their attire,"
300,19,1539,Thy sacrifice they shall be made; these hands in mischievous fire
300,19,1540,"Shall vent their vanities. And yet, being consecrate to thee,"
300,19,1541,"They shall be kept for citizens, and their fair wives, to see.”"
300,19,1542,Thus spake she weeping; all the dames endeavouring to cheer
300,19,1543,"Her desert state, fearing their own, wept with her tear for tear."

300,19,1557,"Where Diomed, for horse - race, wins the fame;"
300,19,1558,"For foot, Ulysses; others otherwise"
300,19,1559,"Strive, and obtain; and end the Exsequies."
300,19,1560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,19,1561,"Psi sings the rites of the decease,"
300,19,1562,Ordain’d by great Æacides.
300,19,1563,Thus mourn’d all Troy. But when at fleet and Hellespontus’ shore
300,19,1564,"The Greeks arriv’d, each to his ship; only the Conqueror"
300,19,1565,"Kept undispers’d his Myrmidons, and said, “Lov’d countrymen"
300,19,1566,"Disjoin not we chariots and horse, but, bearing hard our rein,"
300,19,1567,"With state of both, march soft and close, and mourn about the corse;"
300,19,1568,"’Tis proper honour to the dead. Then take we out our horse,"
300,19,1569,When with our friends’ kind woe our hearts have felt delight to do
300,19,1570,"A virtuous soul right, and then sup.” This said, all full of woe"
300,19,1571,"Circled the corse; Achilles led, and thrice, about him close,"
300,19,1572,"All bore their goodly - coated horse. Amongst all Thetis rose,"
300,19,1573,"And stirr’d up a delight in grief, till all their arms with tears,"
300,19,1574,"And all the sands, were wet; so much they lov’d that Lord of Fears."
300,19,1575,"Then to the centre fell the prince; and, putting in the breast"
300,19,1576,"Of his slain friend his slaught’ring hands, began to all the rest"
300,19,1577,"Words to their tears: “Rejoice, said he, “O my Patroclus, thou"
300,19,1578,Courted by Dis now. Now I pay to thy late overthrow
300,19,1579,All my revenges vow’d before. Hector lies slaughter’d here
300,19,1580,"Dragg’d at my chariot, and our dogs shall all in pieces tear"
300,19,1581,"His hated limbs. Twelve Trojan youths, born of their noblest strains,"
300,19,1582,"I took alive; and, yet enrag’d, will empty all their veins"
300,19,1583,"Of vital spirits, sacrific’d before thy heap of fire.”"
300,19,1584,"This said, a work unworthy him he put upon his ire,"
300,19,1585,And trampled Hector under foot at his friend’s feet. The rest
300,19,1586,"Disarm’d, took horse from chariot, and all to sleep address’d"
300,19,1587,At his black vessel. Infinite were those that rested there.
300,19,1588,"Himself yet sleeps not, now his spirits were wrought about the cheer"
300,19,1589,Fit for so high a funeral. About the steel us’d then
300,19,1590,"Oxen in heaps lay bellowing, preparing food for men;"
300,19,1591,"Bleating of sheep and goats fill’d air; numbers of white - tooth’d swine,"
300,19,1592,"Swimming in fat, lay singeing there. The person of the slain"
300,19,1593,"Was girt with slaughter. All this done, all the Greek kings convey’d"
300,19,1594,Achilles to the King of men; his rage not yet allay’d
300,19,1595,"For his Patroclus. Being arriv’d at Agamemnon’s tent,"
300,19,1596,"Himself bade heralds put to fire a caldron, and present"
300,19,1597,"The service of it to the prince, to try if they could win"
300,19,1598,His pleasure to admit their pains to cleanse the blood soak’d in
300,19,1599,"About his conqu’ring hands and brows. “Not by the King of Heav’n,”"
300,19,1600,He swore. “The laws of friendship damn this false - heart licence giv’n
300,19,1601,To men that lose friends. Not a drop shall touch me till I put
300,19,1602,"Patroclus in the fun’ral pile, before these curls be cut,"
300,19,1603,"His tomb erected. ’Tis the last of all care I shall take,"
300,19,1604,"While I consort the careful. Yet, for your entreaties’ sake,"
300,19,1605,"And though I loathe food, I will eat. But early in the morn,"
300,19,1606,"Atrides, use your strict command that loads of wood be borne"
300,19,1607,"To our design’d place, all that fits to light home such a one"
300,19,1608,"As is to pass the shades of death, that fire enough set gone"
300,19,1609,"His person quickly from our eyes, and our diverted men"
300,19,1610,"May ply their business.” This all ears did freely entertain,"
300,19,1611,"And found observance. Then they supp’d with all things fit, and all"
300,19,1612,Repair’d to tents and rest. The friend the shores maritimal
300,19,1613,"Sought for his bed, and found a place, fair, and upon which play’d"
300,19,1614,"The murmuring billows. There his limbs to rest, not sleep, he laid,"
300,19,1615,"Heavily sighing. Round about, silent and not too near,"
300,19,1616,"Stood all his Myrmidons; when straight, so over - labour’d were"
300,19,1617,"His goodly lineaments with chase of Hector, that, beyond"
300,19,1618,"His resolution not to sleep, Sleep cast his sudden bond"
300,19,1619,"Over his sense, and loos’d his care. Then of his wretched friend"
300,19,1620,The Soul appear’d; at ev’ry part the form did comprehend
300,19,1621,"His likeness; his fair eyes, his voice, his stature, ev’ry weed"
300,19,1622,"His person wore, it fantasied; and stood above his head,"
300,19,1623,"This sad speech utt’ring: “Dost thou sleep? Æacides, am I"
300,19,1624,"Forgotten of thee? Being alive, I found thy memory"
300,19,1625,"Ever respectful; but now, dead, thy dying love abates."
300,19,1626,"Inter me quickly, enter me in Pluto’s iron gates,"
300,19,1627,"For now the souls (the shades) of men, fled from this being, beat"
300,19,1628,"My spirit from rest, and stay my much - desir’d receipt"
300,19,1629,Amongst souls plac’d beyond the flood. Now ev’ry way I err
300,19,1630,About this broad - door’d house of Dis. O help then to prefer
300,19,1631,"My soul yet further! Here I mourn, but, had the fun’ral fire"
300,19,1632,"Consum’d my body, never more my spirit should retire"
300,19,1633,From hell’s low región; from thence souls never are retriev’d
300,19,1634,To talk with friends here; nor shall I; a hateful fate depriv’d
300,19,1635,"My being here, that at my birth was fix’d; and to such fate"
300,19,1636,"Ev’n thou, O god - like man, art mark’d; the deadly Ilion gate"
300,19,1637,"Must entertain thy death. O then, I charge thee now, take care"
300,19,1638,That our bones part not; but as life combin’d in equal fare
300,19,1639,"Our loving beings, so let death. When from Opunta’s tow’rs"
300,19,1640,"My father brought me to your roofs (since, ’gainst my will, my pow’rs"
300,19,1641,"Incens’d, and indiscreet at dice, slew fair Amphidamas)"
300,19,1642,Then Peleus entertain’d me well; then in thy charge I was
300,19,1643,By his injunction and thy love; and therein let me still
300,19,1644,"Receive protection. Both our bones, provide in thy last will,"
300,19,1645,"That one urn may contain; and make that vessel all of gold,"
300,19,1646,"That Thetis gave thee, that rich urn.” This said, Sleep ceas’d to hold"
300,19,1647,"Achilles’ temples, and the Shade thus he receiv’d: “O friend,"
300,19,1648,"What needed these commands? My care, before, meant to commend"
300,19,1649,"My bones to thine, and in that urn. Be sure thy will is done."
300,19,1650,"A little stay yet, let’s delight, with some full passión"
300,19,1651,"Of woe enough, either’s affects; embrace we.” Op’ning thus"
300,19,1652,"His greedy arms, he felt no friend; like matter vaporous"
300,19,1653,"The Spirit vanish’d under earth, and murmur’d in his stoop."
300,19,1654,"Achilles started, both his hands he clapp’d, and lifted up,"
300,19,1655,"In this sort wond’ring: “O ye Gods, I see we have a soul"
300,19,1656,"In th’ under - dwellings, and a kind of man - resembling idol;"
300,19,1657,"The soul’s seat yet, all matter felt, stays with the carcass here."
300,19,1658,"O friends, hapless Patroclus’ soul did all this night appear"
300,19,1659,"Weeping and making moan to me, commanding ev’rything"
300,19,1660,That I intended towards him; so truly figuring
300,19,1661,"Himself at all parts, as was strange.” This accident did turn"
300,19,1662,"To much more sorrow, and begat a greediness to mourn"
300,19,1663,"In all that heard. When mourning thus, the rosy Morn arose,"
300,19,1664,"And Agamemnon through the tents wak’d all, and did dispose"
300,19,1665,Both men and mules for carriage of matter for the fire;
300,19,1666,"Of all which work Meriones, the Cretan sov’reign’s squire,"
300,19,1667,Was captain; and abroad they went. Wood - cutting tools they bore
300,19,1668,"Of all hands, and well - twisted cords. The mules march’d all before."
300,19,1669,"Uphill, and down hill, overthwarts, and break - neck cliffs they pass’d;"
300,19,1670,"But, when the fountful Ida’s tops they scal’d with utmost haste,"
300,19,1671,"All fell upon the high - hair’d oaks, and down their curléd brows,"
300,19,1672,"Fell bustling to the earth, and up went all the boles and boughs"
300,19,1673,Bound to the mules; and back again they parted the harsh way
300,19,1674,"Amongst them through the tangling shrubs, and long they thought the day"
300,19,1675,"Till in the plain field all arriv’d, for all the woodmen bore"
300,19,1676,Logs on their necks; Meriones would have it so. The shore
300,19,1677,"At last they reach’d yet, and then down their carriages they cast,"
300,19,1678,"And sat upon them, where the son of Peleüs had plac’d"
300,19,1679,"The ground for his great sepulchre, and for his friend’s, in one."
300,19,1680,"They rais’d a huge pile, and to arms went ev’ry Myrmidon,"
300,19,1681,Charg’d by Achilles; chariots and horse were harnesséd.
300,19,1682,"Fighters and charioteers got up, and they the sad march led,"
300,19,1683,A cloud of infinite foot behind. In midst of all was borne
300,19,1684,"Patroclus’ person by his peers. On him were all heads shorn,"
300,19,1685,Ev’n till they cover’d him with curls. Next to him march’d his friend
300,19,1686,"Embracing his cold neck all sad, since now he was to send"
300,19,1687,His dearest to his endless home. Arriv’d all where the wood
300,19,1688,"Was heap’d for fun’ral, they set down. Apart Achilles stood,"
300,19,1689,"And when enough wood was heap’d on, he cut his golden hair,"
300,19,1690,"Long kept for Sperchius the flood, in hope of safe repair"
300,19,1691,"To Phthia by that river’s pow’r; but now left hopeless thus,"
300,19,1692,"Enrag’d, and looking on the sea, he cried out: “Sperchius,"
300,19,1693,"In vain my father’s piety vow’d, at my implor’d return"
300,19,1694,"To my lov’d country, that these curls should on thy shores be shorn,"
300,19,1695,"Besides a sacred hecatomb, and sacrifice beside"
300,19,1696,"Of fifty wethers, at those founts, where men have edified"
300,19,1697,"A lofty temple, and perfum’d an altar to thy name."
300,19,1698,"There vow’d he all these offerings; but fate prevents thy fame,"
300,19,1699,His hopes not suff’ring satisfied. And since I never more
300,19,1700,"Shall see my lov’d soil, my friend’s hands shall to the Stygian shore"
300,19,1701,Convey these tresses.” Thus he put in his friend’s hands the hair;
300,19,1702,And this bred fresh desire of moan; and in that sad affair
300,19,1703,"The sun had set amongst them all, had Thetis’ son not spoke"
300,19,1704,"Thus to Atrides: “King of men, thy aid I still invoke,"
300,19,1705,"Since thy command all men still hear. Dismiss thy soldiers now,"
300,19,1706,And let them victual; they have mourn’d sufficient; ’tis we owe
300,19,1707,The dead this honour; and with us let all the captains stay.”
300,19,1708,"This heard, Atrides instantly the soldiers sent away;"
300,19,1709,"The fun’ral officers remain’d, and heap’d on matter still,"
300,19,1710,"Till of an hundred foot about they made the fun’ral pile,"
300,19,1711,"In whose hot height they cast the corse, and then they pour’d on tears."
300,19,1712,"Numbers of fat sheep, and like store of crooked - going steers,"
300,19,1713,They slew before the solemn fire; stripp’d off their hides and dress’d.
300,19,1714,"Of which Achilles took the fat, and cover’d the deceas’d"
300,19,1715,From head to foot; and round about he made the officers pile
300,19,1716,"The beasts’ nak’d bodies, vessels full of honey and of oil"
300,19,1717,"Pour’d in them, laid upon a bier, and cast into the fire."
300,19,1718,"Four goodly horse; and of nine hounds, two most in the desire"
300,19,1719,"Of that great prince, and trencher - fed; all fed that hungry flame."
300,19,1720,"Twelve Trojan princes last stood forth, young, and of toward fame,"
300,19,1721,"All which (set on with wicked spirits) there strook he, there he slew,"
300,19,1722,And to the iron strength of fire their noble limbs he threw.
300,19,1723,"Then breath’d his last sighs, and these words: “Again rejoice, my"
300,19,1724,"friend,"
300,19,1725,Ev’n in the joyless depth of hell. Now give I cómplete end
300,19,1726,"To all my vows. Alone thy life sustain’d not violence,"
300,19,1727,"Twelve Trojan princes wait on thee, and labour to incense"
300,19,1728,"Thy glorious heap of funeral. Great Hector I’ll excuse,"
300,19,1729,The dogs shall eat him.” These high threats perform’d not their abuse;
300,19,1730,"Jove’s daughter, Venus, took the guard of noble Hector’s corse,"
300,19,1731,"And kept the dogs off, night and day applying sov’reign force"
300,19,1732,"Of rosy balms, that to the dogs were horrible in taste,"
300,19,1733,And with which she the body fill’d. Renown’d Apollo cast
300,19,1734,"A cloud from heav’n, lest with the sun the nerves and lineaments"
300,19,1735,Might dry and putrefy. And now some Pow’rs denied consents
300,19,1736,To this solemnity; the Fire (for all the oily fuel
300,19,1737,It had injected) would not burn; and then the loving Cruel
300,19,1738,"Studied for help, and, standing off, invok’d the two fair Winds,"
300,19,1739,"Zephyr and Boreas, to afford the rage of both their kinds"
300,19,1740,To aid his outrage. Precious gifts his earnest zeal did vow
300,19,1741,"Pour’d from a golden bowl much wine, and pray’d them both to blow,"
300,19,1742,"That quickly his friend’s corse might burn, and that heap’s sturdy"
300,19,1743,breast
300,19,1744,"Embrace consumption. Iris heard. The Winds were at a feast,"
300,19,1745,"All in the court of Zephyrus, that boist’rous blowing Air,"
300,19,1746,Gather’d together. She that wears the thousand - colour’d hair
300,19,1747,"Flew thither, standing in the porch. They, seeing her, all arose,"
300,19,1748,"Call’d to her, ev’ry one desir’d she would awhile repose,"
300,19,1749,"And eat with them. She answer’d: “No, no place of seat is here;"
300,19,1750,"Retreat calls to the Ocean and Æthiopia, where"
300,19,1751,"A hecatomb is off’ring now to heav’n, and there must I"
300,19,1752,Partake the feast of sacrifice. I come to signify
300,19,1753,"That Thetis’ son implores your aids, princes of North and West,"
300,19,1754,"With vows of much fair sacrifice, if each will set his breast"
300,19,1755,"Against his heap of funeral, and make it quickly burn;"
300,19,1756,"Patroclus lies there, whose decease all the Achaians mourn.”"
300,19,1757,"She said, and parted; and out rush’d, with an unmeasur’d roar,"
300,19,1758,"Those two Winds, tumbling clouds in heaps, ushers to either’s blore,"
300,19,1759,And instantly they reach’d the sea; up flew the waves; the gale
300,19,1760,Was strong; reach’d fruitful Troy; and full upon the fire they fall.
300,19,1761,The huge heap thunder’d. All night long from his chok’d breast they
300,19,1762,blew
300,19,1763,A lib’ral flame up; and all night swift - foot Achilles threw
300,19,1764,"Wine from a golden bowl on earth, and steep’d the soil in wine,"
300,19,1765,Still calling on Patroclus’ soul. No father could incline
300,19,1766,"More to a son most dear, nor more mourn at his burnéd bones,"
300,19,1767,"Than did the great prince to his friend at his combustións,"
300,19,1768,"Still creeping near and near the heap, still sighing, weeping still."
300,19,1769,"But when the Day - star look’d abroad, and promis’d from hi hill"
300,19,1770,"Light, which the saffron Morn made good, and sprinkled on the seas,"
300,19,1771,"Then languish’d the great pile, then sunk the flames, and then calm"
300,19,1772,Peace
300,19,1773,Turn’d back the rough Winds to their homes; the Thracian billow rings.
300,19,1774,"Their high retreat, ruffled with cuffs of their triumphant wings."
300,19,1775,"Pelides then forsook the pile, and to his tired limb"
300,19,1776,"Choos’d place of rest; where laid, sweet sleep fell to his wish on him."
300,19,1777,"When all the king’s guard (waiting then, perceiving will to rise"
300,19,1778,"In that great session) hurried in, and op’d again his eyes"
300,19,1779,"With tumult of their troop, and haste. A little then he rear’d"
300,19,1780,"His troubled person, sitting up, and this affair referr’d"
300,19,1781,"To wish’d commandment of the kings: “Atrides, and the rest"
300,19,1782,"Of our commanders general, vouchsafe me this request"
300,19,1783,Before your parting: Give in charge the quenching with black wine
300,19,1784,"Of this heap’s relics, ev’ry brand the yellow fire made shine;"
300,19,1785,"And then let search Patroclus’ bones, distinguishing them well;"
300,19,1786,"As well ye may, they kept the midst, the rest at random fell"
300,19,1787,About th’ extreme part of the pile; men’s bones and horses’ mixed.
300,19,1788,"Being found, I’ll find an urn of gold t’ enclose them, and betwixt"
300,19,1789,"The air and them two kels of fat lay on them, and to rest"
300,19,1790,"Commit them, till mine own bones seal our love, my soul deceas’d."
300,19,1791,"The sepulchre I have not charg’d to make of too much state,"
300,19,1792,"But of a model something mean, that you of younger fate,"
300,19,1793,"When I am gone, may amplify with such a breadth and height"
300,19,1794,As fits your judgments and our worths.” This charge receiv’d his weight
300,19,1795,"In all observance. First they quench’d with sable wine the heap,"
300,19,1796,"As far as it had fed the flame. The ash fell wondrous deep,"
300,19,1797,"In which his consorts, that his life religiously lov’d,"
300,19,1798,"Search’d, weeping, for his bones; which found, they conscionably prov’d"
300,19,1799,"His will made to Æacides, and what his love did add."
300,19,1800,"A golden vessel, double fat, contain’d them. All which, clad"
300,19,1801,"In veils of linen, pure and rich, were solemnly convey’d"
300,19,1802,T’ Achilles’ tent. The platform then about the pile they laid
300,19,1803,"Of his fit sepulchre, and rais’d a heap of earth, and then"
300,19,1804,"Offer’d departure. But the prince retain’d there still his men,"
300,19,1805,"Employing them to fetch from fleet rich tripods for his games,"
300,19,1806,"Caldrons, horse, mules, broad - headed beeves, bright steel, and brighter"
300,19,1807,"dames,"
300,19,1808,"The best at horse - race he ordain’d a lady for his prize,"
300,19,1809,"Gen’rally praiseful, fair and young, and skill’d in housewif’ries"
300,19,1810,"Of all kinds fitting; and withal a trivet, that inclos’d"
300,19,1811,"Twenty - two measures’ room, with ears. The next prize he propos’d"
300,19,1812,"Was (that which then had high respect) a mare of six years old,"
300,19,1813,"Unhandled, horséd with a mule, and ready to have foal’d."
300,19,1814,"The third game was a caldron, new, fair, bright, and could for size"
300,19,1815,"Contain two measures. For the fourth, two talents’ quantities"
300,19,1816,"Of finest gold. The fifth game was a great new standing bowl,"
300,19,1817,"To set down both ways. These brought in, Achilles then stood up,"
300,19,1818,"And said: “Atrides and my lords, chief horsemen of our host,"
300,19,1819,These games expect ye. If myself should interpose my most
300,19,1820,"For our horse - race, I make no doubt that I should take again"
300,19,1821,"These gifts propos’d. Ye all know well, of how divine a strain"
300,19,1822,"My horse are, and how eminent. Of Neptune’s gift they are"
300,19,1823,"To Peleus, and of his to me. Myself then will not share"
300,19,1824,"In gifts giv’n others, nor my steeds breathe any spirit to shake"
300,19,1825,"Their airy pasterns; so they mourn for their kind guider’s sake,"
300,19,1826,"Late lost; that us’d with humorous oil to slick their lofty manes,"
300,19,1827,"Clear water having cleans’d them first; and, his bane being their"
300,19,1828,"banes,"
300,19,1829,"Those lofty manes now strew the earth, their heads held shaken down."
300,19,1830,"You then that trust in chariots, and hope with horse to crown"
300,19,1831,"Your conqu’ring temples, gird yourselves; now, fame and prize stretch"
300,19,1832,"for,"
300,19,1833,All that have spirits.” This fir’d all. The first competitor
300,19,1834,"Was king Eumelus, whom the art of horsemanship did grace,"
300,19,1835,"Son to Admetus. Next to him rose Diomed to the race,"
300,19,1836,"That under reins rul’d Trojan horse, of late forc’d from the son"
300,19,1837,"Of lord Anchises, himself freed of near confusion"
300,19,1838,By Phœbus. Next to him set forth the yellow - headed king
300,19,1839,"Of Lacedæmon, Jove’s high seed; and, in his managing,"
300,19,1840,"Podargus and swift Æthe trod, steeds to the King of men;"
300,19,1841,"Æthe giv’n by Echepolus, the Anchisiaden,"
300,19,1842,As bribe to free him from the war resolv’d for Ilion;
300,19,1843,"So Delicacy feasted him, whom Jove bestow’d upon"
300,19,1844,A mighty wealth; his dwelling was in broad Sicyone.
300,19,1845,"Old Nestor’s son, Antilochus, was fourth for chivalry"
300,19,1846,"In this contention; his fair horse were of the Pylian breed,"
300,19,1847,"And his old father, coming near, inform’d him, for good speed,"
300,19,1848,"With good race notes, in which himself could good instruction give:"
300,19,1849,"“Antilochus, though young thou art, yet thy grave virtues live"
300,19,1850,Belov’d of Neptune and of Jove. Their spirits have taught thee all
300,19,1851,"The art of horsemanship, for which the less thy merits fall"
300,19,1852,In need of doctrine. Well thy skill can wield a chariot
300,19,1853,"In all fit turnings, yet thy horse their slow feet handle not"
300,19,1854,"As fits thy manage, which makes me cast doubts of thy success."
300,19,1855,I well know all these are not seen in art of this address
300,19,1856,More than thyself; their horses yet superior are to thine
300,19,1857,"For their parts, thine want speed to make discharge of a design"
300,19,1858,"To please an artist. But go on, show but thy art and heart"
300,19,1859,"At all points, and set them against their horses’ heart and art;"
300,19,1860,Good judges will not see thee lose. A carpenter’s desert
300,19,1861,Stands more in cunning than in pow’r. A pilot doth avert
300,19,1862,"His vessel from the rock, and wrack, tost with the churlish winds,"
300,19,1863,"By skill, not strength. So sorts it here; one charioteer that finds"
300,19,1864,Want of another’s pow’r in horse must in his own skill set
300,19,1865,An overplus of that to that; and so the proof will get
300,19,1866,"Skill, that still rests within a man, more grace; than pow’r without."
300,19,1867,"He that in horse and chariots trusts, is often hurl’d about"
300,19,1868,"This way and that, unhandsomely, all - heaven wide of his end."
300,19,1869,"He, better skill’d, that rules worse horse, will all observance bend"
300,19,1870,"Right on the scope still of a race, bear near, know ever when to rein,"
300,19,1871,"When give rein, as his foe before, well noted in his vein"
300,19,1872,"Of manage and his steeds’ estate, presents occasion."
300,19,1873,"I’ll give thee instance now, as plain as if thou saw’st it done:"
300,19,1874,"Here stands a dry stub of some tree, a cubit from the ground;[1]"
300,19,1875,"(Suppose the stub of oak or larch, for either are so sound"
300,19,1876,"That neither rots with wet) two stones, white (mark you), white for"
300,19,1877,"view,"
300,19,1878,Parted on either side the stub; and these lay where they drew
300,19,1879,The way into a strait; the race betwixt both lying clear.
300,19,1880,"Imagine them some monument of one long since tomb’d there,"
300,19,1881,"Or that they had been lists of race for men of former years,"
300,19,1882,As now the lists Achilles sets may serve for charioteers
300,19,1883,"Many years hence. When near to these the race grows, then as right"
300,19,1884,Drive on them as thy eye can judge; then lay thy bridle’s weight
300,19,1885,"Most of thy left side; thy right horse then switching, all thy throat,"
300,19,1886,"Spent in encouragements, give him, and all the rein let float"
300,19,1887,About his shoulders; thy near horse will yet be he that gave
300,19,1888,"Thy skill the prize, and him rein so his head may touch the nave"
300,19,1889,Of thy left wheel; but then take care thou runn’st not on the stone
300,19,1890,(With wrack of horse and chariot) which so thou bear’st upon.
300,19,1891,"Shipwrack within the hav’n avoid, by all means; that will breed"
300,19,1892,"Others delight, and thee a shame. Be wise then, and take heed,"
300,19,1893,"My lov’d son, get but to be first at turning in the course,"
300,19,1894,"He lives not that can cote thee then, not if he back’d the horse"
300,19,1895,"The Gods bred, and Adrastus ow’d; divine Arion’s speed"
300,19,1896,"Could not outpace thee, or the horse Laomedon did breed,"
300,19,1897,"Whose race is famous, and fed here.” Thus sat Neleides,"
300,19,1898,When all that could be said was said. And then Meriones;[2]
300,19,1899,Set fifthly forth his fair - man’d horse. All leap’d to chariot;
300,19,1900,And ev’ry man then for the start cast in his proper lot.
300,19,1901,Achilles drew; Antilochus the lot set foremost forth;
300,19,1902,Eumelus next; Atrides third; Meriones the fourth;
300,19,1903,"The fifth and last was Diomed, far first in excellence."
300,19,1904,"All stood in order, and the lists Achilles fix’d far thence"
300,19,1905,"In plain field; and a seat ordain’d fast by, in which he set"
300,19,1906,"Renownéd Phœnix, that in grace of Peleus was so great,"
300,19,1907,"To see the race, and give a truth of all their passages."
300,19,1908,"All start together, scourg’d, and cried, and gave their business"
300,19,1909,Study and order. Through the field they held a wingéd pace.
300,19,1910,"Beneath the bosom of their steeds a dust so dimm’d the race,"
300,19,1911,"It stood above their heads in clouds, or like to storms amaz’d."
300,19,1912,"Manes flew like ensigns with the wind. The chariots sometime graz’d,"
300,19,1913,"And sometimes jump’d up to the air; yet still sat fast the men,"
300,19,1914,Their spirits ev’n panting in their breasts with fervour to obtain.
300,19,1915,"But when they turn’d to fleet again, then all men’s skills were tried,"
300,19,1916,Then stretch’d the pasterns of their steeds. Eumelus’ horse in pride
300,19,1917,"Still bore their sov’reign. After them came Diomed’s coursers close,"
300,19,1918,"Still apt to leap their chariot, and ready to repose"
300,19,1919,Upon the shoulders of their king their heads; his back ev’n burned
300,19,1920,With fire that from their nostrils flew; and then their lord had turn’d
300,19,1921,"The race for him, or giv’n it doubt, if Phœbus had not smit"
300,19,1922,"The scourge out of his hands, and tears of helpless wrath with it"
300,19,1923,"From forth his eyes, to see his horse for want of scourge made slow,"
300,19,1924,"And th’ others, by Apollo’s help, with much more swiftness go."
300,19,1925,"Apollo’s spite Pallas discern’d, and flew to Tydeus’ son,"
300,19,1926,"His scourge reach’d, and his horse made fresh. Then took her angry run"
300,19,1927,"At king Eumelus, brake his gears; his mares on both sides flew,"
300,19,1928,"His draught - tree fell to earth, and him the toss’d - up chariot threw"
300,19,1929,"Down to the earth, his elbows torn, his forehead, all his face"
300,19,1930,"Strook at the centre, his speech lost. And then the turnéd race"
300,19,1931,"Fell to Tydides; before all his conqu’ring horse he drave,"
300,19,1932,And first he glitter’d in the race; divine Athenia gave
300,19,1933,"Strength to his horse, and fame to him. Next him drave Sparta’s king."
300,19,1934,Antilochus his father’s horse then urg’d with all his sting
300,19,1935,"Of scourge and voice: “Run low,” said he, “stretch out your limbs, and"
300,19,1936,fly;
300,19,1937,"With Diomed’s horse I bid not strive, nor with himself strive I;"
300,19,1938,"Athenia wings his horse, and him renowns; Atrides’ steeds"
300,19,1939,"Are they ye must not fail but reach; and soon, lest soon succeeds"
300,19,1940,"The blot of all your fames, to yield in swiftness to a mare,"
300,19,1941,"To female Æthe. What’s the cause, ye best that ever were,"
300,19,1942,"That thus ye fail us? Be assur’d, that Nestor’s love ye lose"
300,19,1943,"For ever, if ye fail his son. Through both your both sides goes"
300,19,1944,"His hot steel, if ye suffer me to bring the last prize home."
300,19,1945,"Haste, overtake them instantly; we needs must overcome."
300,19,1946,"This harsh way next us, this my mind will take, this I despise"
300,19,1947,"For peril, this I’ll creep through. Hard the way to honour lies,"
300,19,1948,"And that take I, and that shall yield.” His horse by all this knew"
300,19,1949,"He was not pleas’d, and fear’d his voice, and for a while they flew."
300,19,1950,"But straight more clear appear’d the strait Antilochus foresaw,"
300,19,1951,"It was a gasp the earth gave, forc’d by humours cold and raw,"
300,19,1952,"Pour’d out of Winter’s wat’ry breast, met there, and cleaving deep"
300,19,1953,"All that near passage to the lists. This Nestor’s son would keep,"
300,19,1954,"And left the roadway, being about. Atrides fear’d, and cried:[3]"
300,19,1955,"“Antilochus, thy course is mad; contain thy horse, we ride"
300,19,1956,"A way most dangerous; turn head, betime take larger field,"
300,19,1957,We shall be splitted.” Nestor’s son with much more scourge impell’d
300,19,1958,"His horse for this, as if not heard; and got as far before"
300,19,1959,As any youth can cast a quoit. Atrides would no more;
300,19,1960,"He back again, for fear himself, his goodly chariot,"
300,19,1961,"And horse together, strew’d the dust, in being so dusty hot"
300,19,1962,"Of thirsted conquest. But he chid, at parting, passing sore:"
300,19,1963,"“Antilochus,” said he, “a worse than thee earth never bore."
300,19,1964,"Farewell, we never thought thee wise that were wise; but not so"
300,19,1965,"Without oaths shall the wreath, be sure, crown thy mad temples. Go.”"
300,19,1966,"Yet he bethought him, and went too, thus stirring up his steeds:"
300,19,1967,"“Leave me not last thus, nor stand vex’d. Let these fail in the speeds"
300,19,1968,"Of feet and knees, not you. Shall these, these old jades, past the"
300,19,1969,flow’r
300,19,1970,"Of youth that you have, pass you?” This the horse fear’d, and more"
300,19,1971,pow’r
300,19,1972,"Put to their knees, straight getting ground. Both flew, and so the"
300,19,1973,rest.
300,19,1974,"All came in smokes, like spirits. The Greeks, set, to see who did best,"
300,19,1975,"Without the race, aloft, now made a new discovery,"
300,19,1976,Other than that they made at first. Idomenëus’ eye
300,19,1977,"Distinguish’d all, he knew the voice of Diomed, seeing a horse"
300,19,1978,"Of special mark, of colour bay, and was the first in course,"
300,19,1979,"His forehead putting forth a star, round like the moon, and white."
300,19,1980,"Up stood the Cretan, utt’ring this: “Is it alone my sight,"
300,19,1981,"Princes and captains, that discerns another lead the race"
300,19,1982,With other horse than led of late? Eumelus made most pace
300,19,1983,"With his fleet mares, and he began the flexure as we thought;"
300,19,1984,"Now all the field I search, and find nowhere his view; hath nought"
300,19,1985,Befall’n amiss to him? Perhaps he hath not with success
300,19,1986,"Perform’d his flexure; his reins lost, or seat, or with the tress"
300,19,1987,"His chariot fail’d him, and his mares have outray’d with affright."
300,19,1988,"Stand up, try you your eyes, for mine hold with the second sight;"
300,19,1989,"This seems to me th’ Ætolian king, the Tydean Diomed.”"
300,19,1990,"“To you it seems so,” rusticly Ajax Oïleus said,"
300,19,1991,"“Your words are suited to your eyes. Those mares lead still that led,"
300,19,1992,"Eumelus owes them, and he still holds reins and place that did,"
300,19,1993,"Not fall’n as you hop’d. You must prate before us all, though last"
300,19,1994,"In judgment of all. Y’ are too old, your tongue goes still too fast,"
300,19,1995,"You must not talk so. Here are those that better thee, and look"
300,19,1996,For first place in the censure.” This Idomenëus took
300,19,1997,"In much disdain, and thus replied: “Thou best in speeches worst,"
300,19,1998,"Barbarous - languag’d, others here might have reprov’d me first,"
300,19,1999,"Not thou, unfitt’st of all. I bold a tripod with thee here,"
300,19,2000,"Or caldron, and our Gen’ral make our equal arbiter,"
300,19,2001,"Those horse are first, that when thou pay’st thou then may’st know.”"
300,19,2002,This fir’d
300,19,2003,"Oïliades more, and more than words this quarrel had inspir’d,"
300,19,2004,"Had not Achilles rose, and us’d this pacifying speech:"
300,19,2005,“No more. Away with words in war. It toucheth both with breach
300,19,2006,Of that which fits ye. Your deserts should others reprehend
300,19,2007,"That give such foul terms. Sit ye still, the men themselves will end"
300,19,2008,"The strife betwixt you instantly, and either’s own load bear"
300,19,2009,"On his own shoulders. Then to both the first horse will appear,"
300,19,2010,"And which is second.” These words us’d, Tydides was at hand,"
300,19,2011,"His horse ran high, glanc’d on the way, and up they toss’d the sand"
300,19,2012,Thick on their coachman; on their pace their chariot deck’d with gold
300,19,2013,"Swiftly attended, no wheel seen, nor wheel’s print in the mould."
300,19,2014,"Impress’d behind them. These horse flew a flight, not ran a race."
300,19,2015,"Arriv’d, amids the lists they stood, sweat trickling down apace"
300,19,2016,"Their high manes and their prominent breasts; and down jumped Diomed,"
300,19,2017,"Laid up his scourge aloft the seat, and straight his prize was led"
300,19,2018,"Home to his tent. Rough Sthenelus laid quick hand on the dame,"
300,19,2019,"And handled trivet, and sent both home by his men. Next came"
300,19,2020,"Antilochus, that won with wiles, not swiftness of his horse,"
300,19,2021,"Precedence of the gold - lock’d king, who yet maintained the course"
300,19,2022,"So close, that not the king’s own horse gat more before the wheel"
300,19,2023,"Of his rich chariot, that might still the insecution feel"
300,19,2024,With the extreme hairs of his tail (and that sufficient close
300,19,2025,"Held to his leader, no great space it let him interpose"
300,19,2026,Consider’d in so great a field) that Nestor’s wily son
300,19,2027,"Gat of the king, now at his heels, though at the breach he won"
300,19,2028,"A quoit’s cast of him, which the king again at th’ instant gain’d."
300,19,2029,"Æthe Agamemnonides, that was so richly man’d,"
300,19,2030,Gat strength still as she spent; which words her worth had prov’d with
300,19,2031,"deeds,"
300,19,2032,"Had more ground been allow’d the race; and coted far his steeds,"
300,19,2033,No question leaving for the prize. And now Meriones
300,19,2034,"A dart’s cast came behind the king, his horse of speed much less,"
300,19,2035,"Himself less skill’d t’ importune them, and give a chariot wing."
300,19,2036,"Admetus’ son was last, whose plight Achilles pitying"
300,19,2037,Thus spake: “Best man comes last; yet right must see his prize not
300,19,2038,"least,"
300,19,2039,"The second his deserts must bear, and Diomed the best.”"
300,19,2040,"He said, and all allow’d; and sure the mare had been his own,"
300,19,2041,"Had not Antilochus stood forth, and in his answer shown"
300,19,2042,"Good reason for his interest: “Achilles,” he replied,"
300,19,2043,“I should be angry with you much to see this ratified.
300,19,2044,"Ought you to take from me my right, because his horse had wrong,"
300,19,2045,"Himself being good? He should have us’d, as good men do, his tongue"
300,19,2046,"In pray’r to Their pow’rs that bless good, not trusting to his own,"
300,19,2047,Not to have been in this good last. His chariot overthrown
300,19,2048,O’erthrew not me. Who’s last? Who’s first? Men’s goodness without these
300,19,2049,"Is not our question. If his good you pity yet, and please"
300,19,2050,"Princely to grace it, your tents hold a goodly deal of gold,"
300,19,2051,"Brass, horse, sheep, women; out of these your bounty may be bold,"
300,19,2052,"To take a much more worthy prize than my poor merit seeks,"
300,19,2053,"And give it here before my face, and all these, that the Greeks"
300,19,2054,May glorify your lib’ral hands. This prize I will not yield.
300,19,2055,"Who bears this, whatsoever man, he bears a triéd field."
300,19,2056,"His hand and mine must change some blows.” Achilles laugh’d, and said:"
300,19,2057,"“If thy will be, Antilochus, I’ll see Eumelus paid"
300,19,2058,"Out of my tents. I’ll give him th’ arms, which late I conquer’d in"
300,19,2059,"Asteropæus, forg’d of brass, and wav’d about with tin;"
300,19,2060,"‘Twill be a present worthy him.” This said, Automedon"
300,19,2061,He sent for them. He went and brought; and to Admetus’ son
300,19,2062,"Achilles gave them. He, well pleas’d, receiv’d them. Then arose"
300,19,2063,"Wrong’d Menelaus, much incens’d with young Antilochus."
300,19,2064,"He bent to speak, a herald took his sceptre and gave charge"
300,19,2065,Of silence to the other Greeks; then did the king enlarge
300,19,2066,"The spleen he prison’d, utt’ring this: “Antilochus, till now[4]"
300,19,2067,"We grant thee wise, but in this act what wisdom utter’st thou?"
300,19,2068,"Thou hast disgrac’d my virtue, wrong’d my horse, preferring thine"
300,19,2069,"Much their inferiors. But go to, Princes, nor his nor mine"
300,19,2070,"Judge of with favour, him nor me; lest any Grecian use"
300,19,2071,"This scandal: ‘Menelaus won, with Nestor’s son’s abuse,"
300,19,2072,"The prize in question, his horse worst; himself yet wan the best"
300,19,2073,"By pow’r and greatness.’ Yet, because I would not thus contest"
300,19,2074,"To make parts taking, I’ll be judge; and I suppose none here"
300,19,2075,"Will blame my judgment, I’ll do right: Antilochus, come near,"
300,19,2076,"Come, noble gentleman, ’tis your place, swear by th’ earth - circling"
300,19,2077,"God,"
300,19,2078,"(Standing before your chariot and horse, and that self rod"
300,19,2079,With which you scourg’d them in your hand) if both with will and wile
300,19,2080,You did not cross my chariot.” He thus did reconcile
300,19,2081,"Grace with his disgrace, and with wit restor’d him to his wit:"
300,19,2082,"“Now crave I patience. O king, whatever was unfit;[5]"
300,19,2083,"Ascribe to much more youth in me than you. You, more in age"
300,19,2084,"And more in excellence, know well, the outrays that engage"
300,19,2085,"All young men’s actions; sharper wits, but duller wisdoms, still"
300,19,2086,"From us flow than from you; for which, curb, with your wisdom, will."
300,19,2087,"The prize I thought mine, I yield yours, and, if you please, a prize"
300,19,2088,"Of greater value to my tent I’ll send for, and suffice"
300,19,2089,"Your will at full, and instantly; for, in this point of time,"
300,19,2090,"I rather wish to be enjoin’d your favour’s top to climb,"
300,19,2091,Than to be falling all my time from height of such a grace.[6]
300,19,2092,"O Jove - lov’d king, and of the Gods receive a curse in place.”"
300,19,2093,"This said, he fetch’d his prize to him; and it rejoic’d him so,"
300,19,2094,"That as corn - ears shine with the dew, yet having time to grow,"
300,19,2095,When fields set all their bristles up; in such a ruff wert thou.[7]
300,19,2096,"O Menelaus, answ’ring thus: “Antilochus, I now,"
300,19,2097,"Though I were angry, yield to thee, because I see th’ hadst wit,"
300,19,2098,When I thought not; thy youth hath got the mast’ry of thy spirit.
300,19,2099,"And yet, for all this, ’tis more safe not to abuse at all"
300,19,2100,"Great men, than, vent’ring, trust to wit to take up what may fall;"
300,19,2101,"For no man in our host beside had eas’ly calm’d my spleen,"
300,19,2102,Stirr’d with like tempest. But thyself hast a sustainer been
300,19,2103,"Of much affliction in my cause; so thy good father too,"
300,19,2104,"And so thy brother; at thy suit, I therefore let all go,"
300,19,2105,"Give thee the game here, though mine own, that all these may discern"
300,19,2106,King Menelaus bears a mind at no part proud or stern.”
300,19,2107,"The king thus calm’d, Antilochus receiv’d, and gave the steed"
300,19,2108,To lov’d Noemon to lead thence; and then receiv’d beside
300,19,2109,"The caldron. Next, Meriones, for fourth game, was to have"
300,19,2110,"Two talents’ gold. The fifth, unwon, renown’d Achilles gave"
300,19,2111,"To rev’rend Nestor, being a bowl to set on either end;"
300,19,2112,"Which through the press he carried him: “Receive,” said he, “old"
300,19,2113,"friend,"
300,19,2114,"This gift as fun’ral monument of my dear friend deceas’d,"
300,19,2115,Whom never you must see again. I make it his bequest
300,19,2116,"To you as, without any strife, obtaining it from all."
300,19,2117,"Your shoulders must not undergo the churlish whoorlbat’s fall,"
300,19,2118,"Wrastling is past you, strife in darts, the foot’s celerity;"
300,19,2119,"Harsh age in his years fetters you, and honour sets you free.”"
300,19,2120,"Thus gave he it. He took, and joy’d; but, ere he thank’d, he said:"
300,19,2121,"“Now sure, my honourable son, in all points thou hast play’d"
300,19,2122,The comely orator; no more must I contend with nerves;
300,19,2123,"Feet fail, and hands; arms want that strength, that this and that swing"
300,19,2124,serves
300,19,2125,"Under your shoulders. Would to heav’n, I were so young chinn’d now,"
300,19,2126,"And strength threw such a many of bones, to celebrate this show,"
300,19,2127,"As when the Epians brought to fire, actively honouring thus,"
300,19,2128,King Amaryncea’s funerals in fair Buprasius!
300,19,2129,His sons put prizes down for him; where not a man match’d me
300,19,2130,"Of all the Epians, or the sons of great - soul’d Ætolie,"
300,19,2131,"No, nor the Pylians themselves, my countrymen. I beat"
300,19,2132,"Great Clytomedeus, Enops’ son, at buffets. At the feat"
300,19,2133,"Of wrastling, I laid under me one that against me rose,"
300,19,2134,"Ancæus, call’d Pleuronius. I made Iphiclus lose"
300,19,2135,"The foot - game to me. At the spear, I conquer’d Polydore,"
300,19,2136,"And strong Phylëus. Actor’s sons, of all men, only bore"
300,19,2137,"The palm at horse - race, conquering with lashing on more horse,"
300,19,2138,"And envying my victory, because, before their course,"
300,19,2139,All the best games were gone with me. These men were twins; one was
300,19,2140,"A most sure guide, a most sure guide; the other gave the pass"
300,19,2141,With rod and mettle. This was then. But now young men must wage
300,19,2142,"These works, and my joints undergo the sad defects of age;"
300,19,2143,Though then I was another man. At that time I excell’d[8]
300,19,2144,Amongst th’ heroes. But forth now; let th’ other rites be held
300,19,2145,"For thy deceas’d friend; this thy gift in all kind part I take,"
300,19,2146,"And much it joys my heart, that still, for my true kindness’ sake,"
300,19,2147,"You give me mem’ry. You perceive, in what fit grace I stand"
300,19,2148,Amongst the Grecians; and to theirs you set your graceful hand.
300,19,2149,"The Gods give ample recompense of grace again to thee,"
300,19,2150,"For this and all thy favours!” Thus, back through the thrust drave he,"
300,19,2151,When he had stay’d out all the praise of old Neleides.[9]
300,19,2152,"And now for buffets, that rough game, he order’d passages;"
300,19,2153,"Proposing a laborious mule, of six years old, untam’d,"
300,19,2154,"And fierce in handling, brought, and bound, in that place where they"
300,19,2155,gam’d;
300,19,2156,"And, to the conquer’d, a round cup. Both which he thus proclaims:"
300,19,2157,"“Atrides and all friends of Greece, two men, for these two games,"
300,19,2158,"I bid stand forth. Who best can strike, with high contracted fists,"
300,19,2159,"(Apollo giving him the wreath) know all about these lists,"
300,19,2160,"Shall win a mule, patient of toil; the vanquish’d, this round cup.”"
300,19,2161,"This utter’d; Panopëus’ son, Epëus, straight stood up,"
300,19,2162,"A tall huge man, that to the nail knew that red sport of hand,"
300,19,2163,"And, seizing the tough mule, thus spake: “Now let some other stand"
300,19,2164,"Forth for the cup; this mule is mine, at cuffs I boast me best."
300,19,2165,Is’t not enough I am no soldier? Who is worthiest
300,19,2166,"At all works? None; not possible. At this yet this I say,"
300,19,2167,"And will perform this: Who stands forth, I’ll burst him, I will bray"
300,19,2168,His bones as in a mortar. Fetch surgeons enow to take[10]
300,19,2169,His corse from under me.” This speech did all men silent make.
300,19,2170,"At last stood forth Euryalus, a man god - like, and son"
300,19,2171,"To king Mecisteus, the grandchild of honour’d Talaon."
300,19,2172,"He was so strong that, coming once to Thebes, when Œdipus"
300,19,2173,"Had like rites solemniz’d for him, he went victorious"
300,19,2174,"From all the Thebans. This rare man Tydides would prepare,"
300,19,2175,"Put on his girdle, oxhide cords, fair wrought; and spent much care"
300,19,2176,"That he might conquer, hearten’d him, and taught him tricks. Both"
300,19,2177,dress’d
300,19,2178,"Fit for th’ affair, both forth were brought; then breast oppos’d to"
300,19,2179,"breast,"
300,19,2180,"Fists against fists rose, and, they join’d, rattling of jaws was there,"
300,19,2181,"Gnashing of teeth, and heavy blows dash’d blood out ev’rywhere."
300,19,2182,"At length Epëus spy’d clear way, rush’d in, and such a blow"
300,19,2183,"Drave underneath the other’s ear, that his neat limbs did strow"
300,19,2184,"The knock’d earth, no more legs had he; but as a huge fish laid"
300,19,2185,"Near to the cold - weed - gath’ring shore, is with a north flaw fraid."
300,19,2186,"Shoots back, and in the black deep hides; so, sent against the ground,"
300,19,2187,"Was foil’d Euryalus, his strength so bid in more profound"
300,19,2188,"Deeps of Epëus, who took up th’ intranc’d competitor;"
300,19,2189,"About whom rush’d a crowd of friends, that through the clusters bore"
300,19,2190,"His falt’ring knees, he spitting up thick clods of blood, his head"
300,19,2191,"Totter’d of one side, his sense gone; when, to a by - place led,"
300,19,2192,Thither they brought him the round cup. Pelides then set forth
300,19,2193,"Prize for a wrastling; to the best a trivet, that was worth"
300,19,2194,"Twelve oxen, great and fit for fire; the conquer’d was t’ obtain"
300,19,2195,"A woman excellent in works; her beauty, and her gain,"
300,19,2196,"Priz’d at four oxen. Up he stood, and thus proclaim’d: “Arise,"
300,19,2197,"You wrastlers, that will prove for these.” Out stepp’d the ample size"
300,19,2198,"Of mighty Ajax, huge in strength; to him Laertes’ son,"
300,19,2199,"The crafty one, as huge in sleight. Their ceremony done"
300,19,2200,"Of making ready, forth they stepp’d, catch elbows with strong hands,"
300,19,2201,"And as the beams of some high house crack with a storm, yet stands"
300,19,2202,"The house, being built by well - skill’d men; so crack’d their backbones,"
300,19,2203,wrinch’d
300,19,2204,"With horrid twitches; in their sides, arms, shoulders, all bepinch’d,"
300,19,2205,"Ran thick the wales, red with the blood, ready to start out. Both"
300,19,2206,"Long’d for the conquest and the prize; yet show’d no play, being loth"
300,19,2207,To lose both. Nor could Ithacus stir Ajax; nor could he
300,19,2208,"Hale down Ulysses, being more strong than with mere strength to be"
300,19,2209,"Hurl’d from all vantage of his sleight. Tir’d then with tugging play,"
300,19,2210,"Great Ajax Telamonius said: “Thou wisest man, or lay"
300,19,2211,"My face up, or let me lay thine; let Jove take care for these.”"
300,19,2212,"This said, he hois’d him up to air; when Laertiades"
300,19,2213,"His wiles forgat not, Ajax’ thigh he strook behind, and flat"
300,19,2214,He on his back fell; on his breast Ulysses. Wonder’d at
300,19,2215,"Was this of all; all stood amaz’d. Then the much - suff’ring man,"
300,19,2216,"Divine Ulysses, at next close the Telamonian"
300,19,2217,"A little rais’d from earth, not quite, but with his knee implied"
300,19,2218,"Lock’d legs; and down fell both on earth, close by each other’s side,"
300,19,2219,"Both fil’d with dust; but starting up, the third close they had made,"
300,19,2220,"Had not Achilles’ self stood up, restraining them, and bade:"
300,19,2221,"“No more tug one another thus, nor moil yourselves; receive"
300,19,2222,Prize equal; conquest crowns ye both; the lists to others leave.”
300,19,2223,"They heard, and yielded willingly, brush’d off the dust, and on"
300,19,2224,"Put other vests. Pelides then, to those that swiftest run,"
300,19,2225,"Propos’d another prize; a bowl, beyond comparison,"
300,19,2226,"Both for the size and workmanship, past all the bowls of earth."
300,19,2227,It held six measures; silver all; but had his special worth
300,19,2228,"For workmanship, receiving form from those ingenious men"
300,19,2229,"Of Sidon. The Phœnicians made choice, and brought it then"
300,19,2230,"Along the green sea, giving it to Thoas; by degrees"
300,19,2231,"It came t’ Eunæus, Jason’s son, who young Priamides,"
300,19,2232,"Lycaon, of Achilles’ friend bought with it; and this here"
300,19,2233,"Achilles made best game for him, that best his feet could bear."
300,19,2234,"For second he propos’d an ox, a huge one, and a fat;"
300,19,2235,And half a talent gold for last. These thus he set them at:
300,19,2236,"“Rise, you that will assay for these.” Forth stepp’d Oïliades;"
300,19,2237,"Ulysses answer’d; and the third was, one esteem’d past these"
300,19,2238,"For footmanship, Antilochus. All rank’d, Achilles show’d"
300,19,2239,The race - scope. From the start they glid. Oïliades bestow’d
300,19,2240,His feet the swiftest; close to him flew god - like Ithacus.
300,19,2241,"And as a lady at her loom, being young and beauteous,"
300,19,2242,"Her silk - shuttle close to her breast, with grace that doth inflame,"
300,19,2243,"And her white hand, lifts quick and oft, in drawing from her frame"
300,19,2244,"Her gentle thread, which she unwinds with ever at her breast"
300,19,2245,"Gracing her fair hand; so close still, and with such interest"
300,19,2246,"In all men’s likings, Ithacus unwound, and spent the race"
300,19,2247,"By him before, took out his steps with putting in their place"
300,19,2248,"Promptly and gracefully his own, sprinkled the dust before,"
300,19,2249,And clouded with his breath his head. So facilie he bore
300,19,2250,"His royal person, that he strook shouts from the Greeks, with thirst"
300,19,2251,"That he should conquer, though he flew: “Yet come, come, O come first,”"
300,19,2252,Ever they cried to him. And this ev’n his wise breast did move
300,19,2253,"To more desire of victory; it made him pray, and prove,"
300,19,2254,"Minerva’s aid, his fautress still: “O Goddess, hear,” said he,"
300,19,2255,"“And to my feet stoop with thy help, now happy fautress be.”"
300,19,2256,"She was, and light made all his limbs. And now, both near their crown,"
300,19,2257,"Minerva tripp’d up Ajax’ heels, and headlong he fell down"
300,19,2258,"Amids the ordure of the beasts, there negligently left"
300,19,2259,"Since they were slain there; and by this, Minerva’s friend bereft"
300,19,2260,"Oïliades of that rich bowl, and left his lips, nose, eyes,"
300,19,2261,"Ruthfully smear’d. The fat ox yet he seiz’d for second prize,"
300,19,2262,"Held by the horn, spit out the tail, and thus spake all - besmear’d:"
300,19,2263,“O villainous chance! This Ithacus so highly is endear’d
300,19,2264,"To his Minerva, that her hand is ever in his deeds."
300,19,2265,"She, like his mother, nestles him; for from her it proceeds,"
300,19,2266,"I know, that I am us’d thus.” This all in light laughter cast;"
300,19,2267,Amongst whom quick Antilochus laugh’d out his coming last
300,19,2268,"Thus wittily: “Know, all my friends, that all times past, and now,"
300,19,2269,The Gods most honour most - liv’d men. Oïliades ye know
300,19,2270,"More old than I, but Ithacus is of the foremost race,"
300,19,2271,"First generation of men. Give the old man his grace,"
300,19,2272,They count him of the green - hair’d eld; they may; or in his flow’r;
300,19,2273,For not our greatest flourisher can equal him in pow’r
300,19,2274,"Of foot - strife, but Æacides.” Thus sooth’d he Thetis’ son"
300,19,2275,"Who thus accepted it: “Well, youth, your praises shall not run"
300,19,2276,"With unrewarded feet on mine, your half a talent’s prize"
300,19,2277,"I’ll make a whole one. Take you, sir.” He took, and joy’d. Then flies"
300,19,2278,"Another game forth. Thetis’ son set in the lists a lance,"
300,19,2279,"A shield, and helmet, being th’ arms Sarpedon did advance"
300,19,2280,"Against Patroclus, and he pris’d. And thus he nam’d th’ address:"
300,19,2281,"“Stand forth two the most excellent, arm’d, and before all these"
300,19,2282,Give mutual onset to the touch and wound of either’s flesh.
300,19,2283,"Who first shall wound, through other’s arms his blood appearing fresh,"
300,19,2284,"Shall win this sword, silver’d, and hatch’d; the blade is right of"
300,19,2285,Thrace;
300,19,2286,Asteropæus yielded it. These arms shall part their grace
300,19,2287,With either’s valour; and the men I’ll liberally feast
300,19,2288,At my pavilion.” To this game the first man that address’d
300,19,2289,Was Ajax Telamonius; to him king Diomed.
300,19,2290,"Both, in oppos’d parts of the press, full arm’d, both enteréd"
300,19,2291,"The lists amids the multitude, put looks on so austere,"
300,19,2292,"And join’d so roughly, that amaze surpris’d the Greeks in fear"
300,19,2293,"Of either’s mischief. Thrice they threw their fierce darts, and clos’d"
300,19,2294,thrice.
300,19,2295,"Then Ajax strook through Diomed’s shield, but did no prejudice,"
300,19,2296,"His curets saft him. Diomed’s dart still over shoulders flew,"
300,19,2297,Still mounting with the spirit it bore. And now rough Ajax grew
300,19,2298,"So violent, that the Greeks cried: “Hold, no more. Let them no more."
300,19,2299,"Give equal prize to either.” Yet the sword, propos’d before"
300,19,2300,"For him did best, Achilles gave to Diomed. Then a stone,"
300,19,2301,"In fashion of a sphere, he show’d; of no inventión,"
300,19,2302,"But natural, only melted through with iron. ’Twas the bowl"
300,19,2303,That king Eetion us’d to hurl; but he bereft of soul
300,19,2304,"By great Achilles, to the fleet, with store of other prise,"
300,19,2305,"He brought it, and propos’d it now both for the exercise"
300,19,2306,"And prize itself. He stood, and said: “Rise you that will approve"
300,19,2307,Your arms’ strengths now in this brave strife. His vigour that can move
300,19,2308,"This furthest, needs no game but this; for reach he ne’er so far"
300,19,2309,"With large fields of his own in Greece (and so needs for his car,"
300,19,2310,"His plough, or other tools of thrift, much iron) I’ll able this"
300,19,2311,For five revolvéd years; no need shall use his messages
300,19,2312,"To any town to furnish him, this only bowl shall yield"
300,19,2313,"Iron enough for all affairs.” This said; to try this field,"
300,19,2314,First Polypœtes issuéd; next Leontëus; third
300,19,2315,"Great Ajax; huge Epëus fourth, yet he was first that stirr’d"
300,19,2316,"That mine of iron. Up it went, and up he toss’d it so,"
300,19,2317,That laughter took up all the field. The next man that did throw
300,19,2318,"Was Leontëus; Ajax third, who gave it such a hand,"
300,19,2319,That far past both their marks it flew. But now ’twas to be mann’d
300,19,2320,"By Polypœtes, and, as far as at an ox that strays"
300,19,2321,"A herdsman can swing out his goad, so far did he outraise"
300,19,2322,The stone past all men; all the field rose in a shout to see’t;
300,19,2323,"About him flock’d his friends, and bore the royal game to fleet."
300,19,2324,"For archery he then set forth ten axes edg’d two ways,"
300,19,2325,"And ten of one edge. On the shore, far - off, he caus’d to raise"
300,19,2326,"A ship - mast; to whose top they tied a fearful dove by th’ foot,"
300,19,2327,"At which all shot, the game put thus; He that the dove could shoot,"
300,19,2328,"Nor touch the string that fasten’d her, the two - edg’d tools should bear"
300,19,2329,"All to the fleet. Who touch’d the string, and miss’d the dove, should"
300,19,2330,share
300,19,2331,"The one - edg’d axes. This propos’d; king Teucer’s force arose,"
300,19,2332,And with him rose Meriones. And now lots must dispose
300,19,2333,"Their shooting first; both which let fall into a helm of brass,"
300,19,2334,"First Teucer’s came, and first he shot, and his cross fortune was"
300,19,2335,"To shoot the string, the dove untouch’d; Apollo did envy"
300,19,2336,"His skill, since not to him he vow’d, being God of archery,"
300,19,2337,"A first - fall’n lamb. The bitter shaft yet cut in two the cord,"
300,19,2338,"That down fell, and the dove aloft up to the welkin soar’d."
300,19,2339,The Greeks gave shouts. Meriones first made a hearty vow
300,19,2340,"To sacrifice a first - fall’n lamb to Him that rules the bow,"
300,19,2341,"And then fell to his aim, his shaft being ready nock’d before."
300,19,2342,"He spy’d her in the clouds that here, there, ev’rywhere, did soar,"
300,19,2343,"Yet at her height he reach’d her side, strook her quite through, and"
300,19,2344,down
300,19,2345,"The shaft fell at his feet; the dove the mast again did crown,"
300,19,2346,"There hung the head, and all her plumes were ruffled, she stark dead,"
300,19,2347,"And there, far off from him, she fell. The people wonderéd,"
300,19,2348,And stood astonish’d; th’ archer pleas’d. Æacides then shows
300,19,2349,"A long lance, and a caldron new, engrail’d with twenty hues,"
300,19,2350,Priz’d at an ox. These games were show’d for men at darts; and then
300,19,2351,"Up rose the General of all, up rose the King of men,"
300,19,2352,"Up rose late - crown’d Meriones. Achilles, seeing the King"
300,19,2353,"Do him this grace, prevents more deed, his royal offering"
300,19,2354,"Thus interrupting: “King of men, we well conceive how far"
300,19,2355,"Thy worth superior is to all, how much most singular"
300,19,2356,"Thy pow’r is, and thy skill in darts! Accept then this poor prize"
300,19,2357,"Without contention, and (your will pleas’d with what I advise)"
300,19,2358,Afford Meriones the lance.” The King was nothing slow
300,19,2359,To that fit grace. Achilles then the brass lance did bestow
300,19,2360,"On good Meriones. The King his present would not save,"
300,19,2361,But to renown’d Talthybius the goodly caldron gave.

300,19,2377,THE TWENTY - FOURTH BOOK OF HOMER’S ILIADS
300,19,2378,THE ARGUMENT
300,19,2379,"Jove, entertaining care of Hector’s corse,"
300,19,2380,"Sends Thetis to her son for his remorse,"
300,19,2381,And fit dismission of it. Iris then
300,19,2382,He sends to Priam; willing him to gain
300,19,2383,"His son for ransom. He, by Hermes led,"
300,19,2384,Gets through Achilles’ guards; sleeps deep and dead
300,19,2385,"Cast on them by his guide; when, with access"
300,19,2386,"And humble suit made to Æacides,"
300,19,2387,"He gains the body; which to Troy he bears,"
300,19,2388,"And buries it with feasts, buried in tears."
300,19,2389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
300,19,2390,"Omega sings the Exsequies,"
300,19,2391,And Hector’s redemptory prise.
300,19,2392,"The games perform’d; the soldiers wholly dispers’d to fleet,"
300,19,2393,Supper and sleep their only care. Constant Achilles yet
300,19,2394,"Wept for his friend, nor sleep itself, that all things doth subdue,"
300,19,2395,"Could touch at him; this way and that he turn’d, and did renew"
300,19,2396,"His friend’s dear memory, his grace in managing his strength,"
300,19,2397,"And his strength’s greatness, how life rack’d into their utmost length"
300,19,2398,"Griefs, battles, and the wraths of seas, in their joint sufferance."
300,19,2399,"Each thought of which turn’d to a tear. Sometimes he would advance,"
300,19,2400,"In tumbling on the shore, his side; sometimes his face: then turn"
300,19,2401,Flat on his bosom; start upright. Although he saw the morn
300,19,2402,"Show sea and shore his ecstasy, he left not, till at last"
300,19,2403,"Rage varied his distraction; horse, chariot, in haste"
300,19,2404,"He call’d for; and, those join’d, the corse was to his chariot tied,"
300,19,2405,"And thrice about the sepulchre he made his fury ride,"
300,19,2406,Dragging the person. All this past; in his pavilion
300,19,2407,"Rest seiz’d him, but with Hector’s corse his rage had never done,"
300,19,2408,"Still suff’ring it t’ oppress the dust. Apollo yet, ev’n dead,"
300,19,2409,"Pitied the prince, and would not see inhuman tyranny fed"
300,19,2410,With more pollution of his limbs; and therefore cover’d round
300,19,2411,"His person with his golden shield, that rude dogs might not wound"
300,19,2412,"His manly lineaments, which threat Achilles cruelly"
300,19,2413,Had us’d in fury. But now Heav’n let fall a gen’ral eye
300,19,2414,"Of pity on him; the blest Gods persuaded Mercury,"
300,19,2415,"Their good observer, to his stealth; and ev’ry Deity"
300,19,2416,"Stood pleas’d with it; Juno except, green Neptune, and the Maid"
300,19,2417,"Grac’d with the blue eyes, all their hearts stood hatefully appaid"
300,19,2418,"Long since, and held it, as at first, to Priam, Ilion,"
300,19,2419,"And all his subjects, for the rape of his licentious son,"
300,19,2420,"Proud Paris, that despis’d these Dames in their divine access"
300,19,2421,"Made to his cottage, and prais’d Her that his sad wantonness"
300,19,2422,So costly nourish’d. The twelfth morn now shin’d on the delay
300,19,2423,"Of Hector’s rescue, and then spake the Deity of the Day"
300,19,2424,"Thus to th’ Immortals: “Shameless Gods, authors of ill ye are"
300,19,2425,To suffer ill. Hath Hector’s life at all times show’d his care
300,19,2426,"Of all your rights, in burning thighs of beeves and goats to you,"
300,19,2427,"And are your cares no more of him? Vouchsafe ye not ev’n now,"
300,19,2428,"Ev’n dead, to keep him, that his wife, his mother, and his son,"
300,19,2429,"Father, and subjects, may be mov’d to those deeds he hath done,"
300,19,2430,"Seeing you preserve him that serv’d you, and sending to their hands"
300,19,2431,"His person for the rites of fire? Achilles, that withstands"
300,19,2432,"All help to others, you can help; one that hath neither heart"
300,19,2433,"Nor soul within him, that will move or yield to any part"
300,19,2434,"That fits a man, but lion - like, uplandish, and mere wild,"
300,19,2435,"Slave to his pride, and all his nerves being naturally compil’d"
300,19,2436,"Of eminent strength, stalks out and preys upon a silly sheep."
300,19,2437,"And so fares this man, that fit ruth that now should draw so deep"
300,19,2438,"In all the world being lost in him; and shame, a quality[1]"
300,19,2439,"Of so much weight, that both it helps and hurts excessively"
300,19,2440,"Men in their manners, is not known, nor hath the pow’r to be,"
300,19,2441,In this man’s being. Other men a greater loss than he
300,19,2442,"Have undergone, a son, suppose, or brother of one womb;"
300,19,2443,"Yet, after dues of woes and tears, they bury in his tomb"
300,19,2444,All their deplorings. Fates have giv’n to all that are true men
300,19,2445,True manly patience; but this man so soothes his bloody vein
300,19,2446,"That no blood serves it, he must have divine - soul’d Hector bound"
300,19,2447,"To his proud chariot, and danc’d in a most barbarous round"
300,19,2448,"About his lov’d friend’s sepulchre, when he is slain. ’Tis vile,"
300,19,2449,And draws no profit after it. But let him now awhile
300,19,2450,Mark but our angers; he is spent; let all his strength take heed
300,19,2451,"It tempts not our wraths; he begets, in this outrageous deed,"
300,19,2452,"The dull earth with his fury’s hate.” White - wristed Juno said,"
300,19,2453,"Being much incens’d, “This doom is one that thou wouldst have obey’d,"
300,19,2454,"Thou bearer of the silver bow, that we in equal care"
300,19,2455,"And honour should hold Hector’s worth, with him that claims a share"
300,19,2456,"In our deservings. Hector suck’d a mortal woman’s breast,"
300,19,2457,Æacides a Goddess’s; ourself had interest
300,19,2458,"Both in his infant nourishment, and bringing up with state,"
300,19,2459,"And to the human Peleüs we gave his bridal mate,"
300,19,2460,Because he had th’ Immortals’ love. To celebrate the feast
300,19,2461,"Of their high nuptials, ev’ry God was glad to be a guest;"
300,19,2462,"And thou fedd’st of his father’s cates, touching thy harp in grace"
300,19,2463,"Of that beginning of our friend, whom thy perfidious face,"
300,19,2464,"In his perfection, blusheth not to match with Priam’s son,"
300,19,2465,O thou that to betray and shame art still companion!”
300,19,2466,Jove thus receiv’d her: “Never give these broad terms to a God.
300,19,2467,"Those two men shall not be compar’d; and yet, of all that trod"
300,19,2468,"The well - pav’d Ilion, none so dear to all the Deities"
300,19,2469,"As Hector was; at least to me, for off’rings most of prize"
300,19,2470,His hands would never pretermit. Our altars ever stood
300,19,2471,"Furnish’d with banquets fitting us, odours and ev’ry good"
300,19,2472,"Smok’d in our temples; and for this, foreseeing it, his fate"
300,19,2473,"We mark’d with honour, which must stand. But, to give stealth estate"
300,19,2474,"In his deliv’rance, shun we that; nor must we favour one"
300,19,2475,"To shame another. Privily, with wrong to Thetis’ son,"
300,19,2476,"We must not work out Hector’s right. There is a ransom due,"
300,19,2477,"And open course, by laws of arms; in which must humbly sue"
300,19,2478,"The friends of Hector. Which just mean if any God would stay,"
300,19,2479,"And use the other, ’twould not serve; for Thetis night and day"
300,19,2480,"Is guardian to him. But would one call Iris hither, I"
300,19,2481,Would give directions that for gifts the Trojan king should buy
300,19,2482,"His Hector’s body, which the son of Thetis shall resign.”"
300,19,2483,"This said, his will was done; the Dame that doth in vapours shine,"
300,19,2484,"Dewy and thin, footed with storms, jump’d to the sable seas"
300,19,2485,‘Twixt Samos and sharp Imber’s cliffs; the lake groan’d with the press
300,19,2486,"Of her rough feet, and, plummet - like, put in an ox’s horn"
300,19,2487,"That bears death to the raw - fed fish, she div’d, and found forlorn"
300,19,2488,"Thetis lamenting her son’s fate, who was in Troy to have,"
300,19,2489,"Far from his country, his death serv’d. Close to her Iris stood,"
300,19,2490,"And said: “Rise, Thetis, prudent Jove, whose counsels thirst not blood,"
300,19,2491,Calls for thee.” Thetis answer’d her with asking: “What’s the cause
300,19,2492,"The great God calls? My sad pow’rs fear’d to break th’ immortal laws,"
300,19,2493,In going fil’d with griefs to heav’n. But He sets snares for none
300,19,2494,With colour’d counsels; not a word of him but shall be done.”
300,19,2495,"She said, and took a sable veil (a blacker never wore"
300,19,2496,A heav’nly shoulder) and gave way. Swift Iris swum before.
300,19,2497,"About both roll’d the brackish waves. They took their banks, and flew"
300,19,2498,Up to Olympus; where they found Saturnius far - of - view
300,19,2499,"Spher’d with heav’n’s ever - being States. Minerva rose, and gave"
300,19,2500,Her place to Thetis near to Jove; and Juno did receive
300,19,2501,"Her entry with a cup of gold, in which she drank to her,"
300,19,2502,"Grac’d her with comfort, and the cup to her hand did refer."
300,19,2503,"She drank, resigning it; and then the Sire of men and Gods"
300,19,2504,"Thus entertain’d her: “Com’st thou up to these our blest abodes,"
300,19,2505,"Fair Goddess Thetis, yet art sad; and that in so high kind"
300,19,2506,"As passeth suff’rance? This I know, and tried thee, and now find"
300,19,2507,"Thy will by mine rul’d, which is rule to all worlds’ government."
300,19,2508,"Besides this trial yet, this cause sent down for thy ascent,"
300,19,2509,Nine days’ contention hath been held amongst th’ Immortals here
300,19,2510,For Hector’s person and thy son; and some advices were
300,19,2511,To have our good spy Mercury steal from thy son the corse;
300,19,2512,"But that reproach I kept far off, to keep in future force"
300,19,2513,"Thy former love and reverence. Haste then, and tell thy son"
300,19,2514,"The Gods are angry, and myself take that wrong he hath done"
300,19,2515,"To Hector in worst part of all, the rather since he still"
300,19,2516,"Detains his person. Charge him then, if he respect my will"
300,19,2517,"For any reason, to resign slain Hector. I will send"
300,19,2518,"Iris to Priam to redeem his son, and recommend"
300,19,2519,"Fit ransom to Achilles’ grace, in which right he may joy"
300,19,2520,And end his vain grief.” To this charge bright Thetis did employ
300,19,2521,"Instant endeavour. From heav’n’s tops she reach’d Achilles’ tent,"
300,19,2522,"Found him still sighing, and some friends with all their complement"
300,19,2523,Soothing his humour; other some with all contentión
300,19,2524,"Dressing his dinner, all their pains and skills consum’d upon"
300,19,2525,"A huge wool - bearer, slaughter’d there. His rev’rend mother then"
300,19,2526,"Came near, took kindly his fair hand, and ask’d him: “Dear son, when"
300,19,2527,"Will sorrow leave thee? How long time wilt thou thus eat thy heart,"
300,19,2528,"Fed with no other food, nor rest? ’Twere good thou wouldst divert"
300,19,2529,"Thy friend’s love to some lady, cheer thy spirits with such kind parts"
300,19,2530,As she can quit thy grace withal. The joy of thy deserts
300,19,2531,"I shall not long have, death is near, and thy all - conqu’ring fate,"
300,19,2532,"Whose haste thou must not haste with grief, but understand the state"
300,19,2533,"Of things belonging to thy life, which quickly order. I"
300,19,2534,"Am sent from Jove t’ advértise thee, that ev’ry Deity"
300,19,2535,"Is angry with thee, himself most, that rage thus reigns in thee"
300,19,2536,"Still to keep Hector. Quit him then, and, for fit ransom, free"
300,19,2537,His injur’d person.” He replied: “Let him come that shall give
300,19,2538,"The ransom, and the person take. Jove’s pleasure must deprive"
300,19,2539,"Men of all pleasures.” This good speech, and many more, the son"
300,19,2540,"And mother us’d, in ear of all the naval statión."
300,19,2541,And now to holy Ilion Saturnius Iris sent:
300,19,2542,"“Go, swift - foot Iris, bid Troy’s king bear fit gifts, and content"
300,19,2543,Achilles for his son’s release; but let him greet alone
300,19,2544,"The Grecian navy; not a man, excepting such a one"
300,19,2545,"As may his horse and chariot guide, a herald, or one old,"
300,19,2546,"Attending him; and let him take his Hector. Be he bold,"
300,19,2547,"Discourag’d nor with death nor fear, wise Mercury shall guide"
300,19,2548,"His passage till the prince be near; and, he gone, let him ride"
300,19,2549,Resolv’d ev’n in Achilles’ tent. He shall not touch the state
300,19,2550,"Of his high person, nor admit the deadliest desperate"
300,19,2551,"Of all about him; for, though fierce, he is not yet unwise,"
300,19,2552,"Nor inconsid’rate, nor a man past awe of Deities,"
300,19,2553,But passing free and curious to do a suppliant grace.”
300,19,2554,"This said, the Rainbow to her feet tied whirlwinds, and the place"
300,19,2555,Reach’d instantly. The heavy court Clamour and Mourning fill’d;
300,19,2556,"The sons all set about the sire; and there stood Grief, and still’d"
300,19,2557,"Tears on their garments. In the midst the old king sate, his weed"
300,19,2558,"All wrinkled, head and neck dust - fil’d; the princesses his seed,"
300,19,2559,"The princesses his sons’ fair wives, all mourning by; the thought"
300,19,2560,"Of friends so many, and so good, being turn’d so soon to nought"
300,19,2561,"By Grecian hands, consum’d their youth, rain’d beauty from their eyes."
300,19,2562,"Iris came near the king; her sight shook all his faculties,"
300,19,2563,"And therefore spake she soft, and said: “Be glad, Dardanides;"
300,19,2564,"Of good occurrents, and none ill, am I ambassadress."
300,19,2565,"Jove greets thee, who, in care, as much as he is distant, deigns"
300,19,2566,"Eye to thy sorrows, pitying thee. My ambassy contains"
300,19,2567,"This charge to thee from him: He wills thou shouldst redeem thy son,"
300,19,2568,"Bear gifts t’ Achilles, cheer him so; but visit him alone,"
300,19,2569,"None but some herald let attend, thy mules and chariot"
300,19,2570,"To manage for thee. Fear nor death let daunt thee, Jove hath got"
300,19,2571,"Hermes to guide thee, who as near to Thetis’ son as needs"
300,19,2572,"Shall guard thee; and being once with him, nor his, nor others’, deeds"
300,19,2573,"Stand touch’d with, he will all contain; nor is he mad, nor vain,"
300,19,2574,"Nor impious, but with all his nerves studious to entertain"
300,19,2575,One that submits with all fit grace.” Thus vanish’d she like wind.
300,19,2576,"He mules and chariot calls, his sons bids see them join’d, and bind"
300,19,2577,"A trunk behind it; he himself down to his wardrobe goes,"
300,19,2578,"Built all of cedar, highly roof’d, and odoriferous,"
300,19,2579,"That much stuff, worth the sight, contain’d. To him he call’d his"
300,19,2580,"queen,"
300,19,2581,"Thus greeting her: “Come, hapless dame, an angel I have seen,"
300,19,2582,"Sent down from Jove, that bade me free our dear son from the fleet"
300,19,2583,With ransom pleasing to our foe. What holds thy judgment meet?
300,19,2584,My strength and spirit lays high charge on all my being to bear
300,19,2585,"The Greeks’ worst, vent’ring through their host.” The queen cried out"
300,19,2586,to hear
300,19,2587,"His vent’rous purpose, and replied: “O whither now is fled"
300,19,2588,The late discretion that renown’d thy grave and knowing head
300,19,2589,"In foreign and thine own rul’d realms, that thus thou dar’st assay"
300,19,2590,"Sight of that man, in whose brow sticks the horrible decay"
300,19,2591,"Of sons so many, and so strong? Thy heart is iron I think."
300,19,2592,"If this stern man, whose thirst of blood makes cruelty his drink,"
300,19,2593,"Take, or but see, thee, thou art dead. He nothing pities woe,"
300,19,2594,"Nor honours age. Without his sight, we have enough to do"
300,19,2595,"To mourn with thought of him. Keep we our palace, weep we here,"
300,19,2596,"Our son is past our helps. Those throes, that my deliv’rers were"
300,19,2597,"Of his unhappy lineaments, told me they should be torn"
300,19,2598,"With black - foot dogs. Almighty Fate, that black hour he was born,"
300,19,2599,"Spun in his springing thread that end; far from his parents’ reach,"
300,19,2600,"This bloody fellow then ordain’d to be their mean, this wretch,"
300,19,2601,"Whose stony liver would to heav’n I might devour, my teeth"
300,19,2602,"My son’s revengers made! Curs’d Greek, he gave him not his death"
300,19,2603,"Doing an ill work; he alone fought for his country, he"
300,19,2604,"Fled not, nor fear’d, but stood his worst; and curséd policy"
300,19,2605,Was his undoing.” He replied: “Whatever was his end
300,19,2606,"Is not our question, we must now use all means to defend"
300,19,2607,"His end from scandal; from which act dissuade not my just will,"
300,19,2608,Nor let me nourish in my house a bird presaging ill
300,19,2609,To my good actions; ’tis in vain. Had any earthly spirit
300,19,2610,"Giv’n this suggestion, if our priests, or soothsay’rs, challenging"
300,19,2611,merit
300,19,2612,"Of prophets, I might hold it false, and be the rather mov’d"
300,19,2613,"To keep my palace, but these ears and these self eyes approv’d"
300,19,2614,It was a Goddess. I will go; for not a word She spake
300,19,2615,"I know was idle. If it were, and that my fate will make"
300,19,2616,"Quick riddance of me at the fleet, kill me, Achilles; come,"
300,19,2617,"When getting to thee, I shall find a happy dying room"
300,19,2618,"On Hector’s bosom, when enough thirst of my tears finds there"
300,19,2619,"Quench to his fervour.” This resolv’d, the works most fair and dear"
300,19,2620,Of his rich screens he brought abroad; twelve veils wrought curiously;
300,19,2621,Twelve plain gowns; and as many suits of wealthy tapestry;
300,19,2622,As many mantles; horsemen’s coats; ten talents of fine gold;
300,19,2623,"Two tripods; caldrons four; a bowl, whose value he did hold"
300,19,2624,"Beyond all price, presented by th’ ambassadors of Thrace."
300,19,2625,"The old king nothing held too dear, to rescue from disgrace"
300,19,2626,His gracious Hector. Forth he came. At entry of his court
300,19,2627,"The Trojan citizens so press’d, that this opprobrious sort"
300,19,2628,"Of check he us’d: “Hence, cast - aways! Away, ye impious crew!"
300,19,2629,Are not your griefs enough at home? What come ye here to view?
300,19,2630,Care ye for my griefs? Would ye see how miserable I am?
300,19,2631,"Is’t not enough, imagine ye? Ye might know, ere ye came,"
300,19,2632,"What such a son’s loss weigh’d with me. But know this for your pains,"
300,19,2633,Your houses have the weaker doors; the Greeks will find their gains
300,19,2634,"The easier for his loss, be sure. But O Troy! ere I see"
300,19,2635,"Thy ruin, let the doors of hell receive and ruin me!”"
300,19,2636,"Thus with his sceptre set he on the crowding citizens,"
300,19,2637,"Who gave back, seeing him so urge. And now he entertains"
300,19,2638,"His sons as roughly, Helenus, Paris, Hippothous,"
300,19,2639,"Pammon, divine Agathones, renown’d Deiphobus,"
300,19,2640,"Agavus, and Antiphonus, and last, not least in arms,"
300,19,2641,The strong Polites: these nine sons the violence of his harms
300,19,2642,"Help’d him to vent in these sharp terms: “Haste, you infamous brood,"
300,19,2643,And get my chariot. Would to heav’n that all the abject blood
300,19,2644,"In all your veins had Hector ’scus’d! O me, accurséd man,"
300,19,2645,"All my good sons are gone, my light the shades Cimmerian"
300,19,2646,"Have swallow’d from me. I have lost Mestor, surnam’d the fair;"
300,19,2647,"Troilus, that ready knight at arms, that made his field repair"
300,19,2648,"Ever so prompt and joyfully; and Hector, amongst men"
300,19,2649,"Esteem’d a God, not from a mortal’s seed, but of th’ Eternal strain,"
300,19,2650,"He seem’d to all eyes. These are gone, you that survive are base,"
300,19,2651,"Liars and common freebooters; all faulty, not a grace,"
300,19,2652,"But in your heels, in all your parts; dancing companions"
300,19,2653,"Ye all are excellent. Hence, ye brats! Love ye to hear my moans?"
300,19,2654,"Will ye not get my chariot? Command it quickly, fly,"
300,19,2655,That I may perfect this dear work.” This all did terrify;
300,19,2656,"And straight his mule - drawn chariot came, to which they fast did bind"
300,19,2657,"The trunk with gifts. And then came forth, with an afflicted mind,"
300,19,2658,Old Hecuba. In her right hand a bowl of gold she bore
300,19,2659,"With sweet wine crown’d, stood near, and said: “Receive this, and"
300,19,2660,"implore,"
300,19,2661,"With sacrificing it to Jove, thy safe return. I see"
300,19,2662,"Thy mind likes still to go, though mine dislikes it utterly."
300,19,2663,"Pray to the black - cloud - gath’ring God, Idæan Jove, that views"
300,19,2664,"All Troy, and all her miseries, that he will deign to use"
300,19,2665,"His most - lov’d bird to ratify thy hopes, that, her broad wing"
300,19,2666,"Spread on thy right hand, thou mayst know thy zealous offering"
300,19,2667,"Accepted, and thy safe return confirm’d; but if he fail,"
300,19,2668,"Fail thy intent, though never so it labours to prevail.”"
300,19,2669,"“This I refuse not,” he replied, “for no faith is so great"
300,19,2670,"In Jove’s high favour, but it must with held - up hands intreat.”"
300,19,2671,"This said, the chambermaid, that held the ewer and basin by,"
300,19,2672,"He bade pour water on his hands; when, looking to the sky,"
300,19,2673,"He took the bowl, did sacrifice, and thus implor’d: “O Jove,"
300,19,2674,"From Ida using thy commands, in all deserts above"
300,19,2675,"All other Gods, vouchsafe me safe, and pity in the sight"
300,19,2676,"Of great Achilles; and, for trust to that wish’d grace, excite"
300,19,2677,"Thy swift - wing’d Messenger, most strong, most of air’s region lov’d,"
300,19,2678,To soar on my right hand; which sight may firmly see approv’d
300,19,2679,"Thy former summons, and my speed.” He pray’d, and heav’n’s King heard,"
300,19,2680,"And instantly cast from his fist air’s all - commanding bird,"
300,19,2681,"The black - wing’d huntress, perfectest of all fowls, which Gods call"
300,19,2682,"Percnos, the eagle. And how broad the chamber nuptial"
300,19,2683,"Of any mighty man hath doors, such breadth cast either wing;"
300,19,2684,"Which now she us’d, and spread them wide on right hand of the king."
300,19,2685,"All saw it, and rejoic’d, and up to chariot he arose,"
300,19,2686,"Drave forth, the portal and the porch resounding as he goes."
300,19,2687,"His friends all follow’d him, and mourn’d as if he went to die;"
300,19,2688,"And bringing him past town to field, all left him; and the eye"
300,19,2689,"Of Jupiter was then his guard, who pitied him, and us’d"
300,19,2690,"These words to Hermes: “Mercury, thy help hath been profus’d"
300,19,2691,"Ever with most grace in consorts of travellers distress’d,"
300,19,2692,"Now cónsort Priam to the fleet; but so, that not the least"
300,19,2693,"Suspicion of him be attain’d, till at Achilles’ tent"
300,19,2694,The convoy hath arriv’d him safe.” This charge incontinent
300,19,2695,"He put in practice. To his feet his feather’d shoes he tied,"
300,19,2696,"Immortal, and made all of gold, with which he us’d to ride"
300,19,2697,"The rough sea and th’ unmeasur’d earth, and equall’d in his pace"
300,19,2698,"The puffs of wind. Then took he up his rod, that hath the grace"
300,19,2699,"To shut what eyes he lists with sleep, and open them again"
300,19,2700,"In strongest trances. This he held, flew forth, and did attain"
300,19,2701,"To Troy and Hellespontus straight. Then like a fair young prince,"
300,19,2702,"First - down - chinn’d, and of such a grace as makes his looks convince"
300,19,2703,"Contending eyes to view him, forth he went to meet the king."
300,19,2704,"He, having pass’d the mighty tomb of Ilus, watering"
300,19,2705,"His mules in Xanthus, the dark even fell on the earth; and then"
300,19,2706,"Idæus (guider of the mules) discern’d this grace of men,"
300,19,2707,"And spake afraid to Priamus: “Beware, Dardanides,"
300,19,2708,Our states ask counsel; I discern the dangerous access
300,19,2709,Of some man near us; now I fear we perish. Is it best
300,19,2710,"To fly, or kiss his knees and ask his ruth of men distress’d?”"
300,19,2711,"Confusion strook the king, cold fear extremely quench’d his veins,"
300,19,2712,"Upright upon his languishing head his hair stood, and the chains"
300,19,2713,Of strong amaze bound all his pow’rs. To both which then came near
300,19,2714,"The prince turn’d Deity, took his hand, and thus bespake the peer:"
300,19,2715,"“To what place, father, driv’st thou out through solitary night,"
300,19,2716,When others sleep? Give not the Greeks sufficient cause of fright
300,19,2717,"To these late travels, being so near, and such vow’d enemies?"
300,19,2718,"Of all which, if with all this load any should cast his eyes"
300,19,2719,"On thy adventures, what would then thy mind esteem thy state,"
300,19,2720,"Thyself old, and thy follow’r old? Resistance could not rate"
300,19,2721,"At any value; as for me, be sure I mind no harm"
300,19,2722,"To thy grave person, but against the hurt of others arm."
300,19,2723,Mine own lov’d father did not get a greater love in me
300,19,2724,"To his good, than thou dost to thine.” He answer’d: “The degree"
300,19,2725,"Of danger in my course, fair son, is nothing less than that"
300,19,2726,"Thou urgest; but some God’s fair hand puts in for my safe state,"
300,19,2727,That sends so sweet a guardian in this so stern a time
300,19,2728,"Of night, and danger, as thyself, that all grace in his prime"
300,19,2729,"Of body and of beauty show’st, all answer’d with a mind"
300,19,2730,"So knowing, that it cannot be but of some blessed kind"
300,19,2731,"Thou art descended.” “Not untrue,” said Hermes, “thy conceit"
300,19,2732,"In all this holds; but further truth relate, if of such weight"
300,19,2733,"As I conceive thy carriage be, and that thy care conveys"
300,19,2734,Thy goods of most price to more guard; or go ye all your ways
300,19,2735,"Frighted from holy Ilion, so excellent a son"
300,19,2736,"As thou hadst (being your special strength) fallen to destructión,"
300,19,2737,"Whom no Greek better’d for his fight?” “O, what art thou,” said he,"
300,19,2738,"“Most worthy youth, of what race born, that thus recount’st to me"
300,19,2739,"My wretched son’s death with such truth?” “Now, father,” he replied,"
300,19,2740,"“You tempt me far, in wond’ring how the death was signified"
300,19,2741,Of your divine son to a man so mere a stranger here
300,19,2742,As you hold me; but I am one that oft have seen him bear
300,19,2743,His person like a God in field; and when in heaps he slew
300,19,2744,"The Greeks, all routed to their fleet, his so victorious view"
300,19,2745,"Made me admire, not feel his hand; because Æacides,"
300,19,2746,"Incens’d, admitted not our fight, myself being of access"
300,19,2747,"To his high person, serving him, and both to Ilion"
300,19,2748,"In one ship sail’d. Besides, by birth I breathe a Myrmidon,"
300,19,2749,"Polyctor, call’d the rich, my sire, declin’d with age like you."
300,19,2750,"Six sons he hath, and me a seventh; and all those six live now"
300,19,2751,"In Phthia, since, all casting lots, my chance did only fall"
300,19,2752,To follow hither. Now for walk I left my General.
300,19,2753,"To - morrow all the sun - burn’d Greeks will circle Troy with arms,"
300,19,2754,"The princes rage to be withheld so idly, your alarms"
300,19,2755,"Not giv’n half hot enough they think, and can contain no more.”"
300,19,2756,"He answer’d: “If you serve the prince, let me be bold t’ implore"
300,19,2757,"This grace of thee, and tell me true: Lies Hector here at fleet,"
300,19,2758,Or have the dogs his flesh?” He said: “Nor dogs nor fowl have yet
300,19,2759,"Touch’d at his person; still he lies at fleet, and in the tent"
300,19,2760,"Of our great Captain, who indeed is much too negligent"
300,19,2761,"Of his fit usage. But, though now twelve days have spent their heat"
300,19,2762,"On his cold body, neither worms with any taint have eat,"
300,19,2763,"Nor putrefaction perish’d it; yet ever, when the Morn"
300,19,2764,"Lifts her divine light from the sea, unmercifully borne"
300,19,2765,"About Patroclus’ sepulchre, it bears his friend’s disdain,"
300,19,2766,Bound to his chariot; but no fits of further outrage reign
300,19,2767,In his distemper. You would muse to see how deep a dew
300,19,2768,"Ev’n steeps the body, all the blood wash’d off, no slend’rest shew"
300,19,2769,"Of gore or quitture, but his wounds all clos’d, though many were"
300,19,2770,"Open’d about him. Such a love the blest Immortals bear,"
300,19,2771,"Ev’n dead, to thy dear son, because his life show’d love to them.”"
300,19,2772,"He joyful answer’d: “O my son, it is a grace supreme"
300,19,2773,In any man to serve the Gods. And I must needs say this;
300,19,2774,"For no cause, having season fit, my Hector’s hands would miss"
300,19,2775,"Advancement to the Gods with gifts, and therefore do not they"
300,19,2776,Miss his remembrance after death. Now let an old man pray
300,19,2777,"Thy graces to receive this cup, and keep it for my love,"
300,19,2778,Nor leave me till the Gods and thee have made my pray’rs approve
300,19,2779,"Achilles’ pity, by thy guide brought to his princely tent.”"
300,19,2780,"Hermes replied: “You tempt me now, old king, to a consent"
300,19,2781,"Far from me, though youth aptly errs. I secretly receive"
300,19,2782,"Gifts that I cannot broadly vouch, take graces that will give"
300,19,2783,"My lord dishonour, or what he knows not, or will esteem"
300,19,2784,Perhaps unfit? Such briberies perhaps at first may seem
300,19,2785,"Sweet and secure; but futurely they still prove sour, and breed"
300,19,2786,Both fear and danger. I could wish thy grave affairs did need
300,19,2787,"My guide to Argos, either shipp’d, or lackeying by thy side,"
300,19,2788,"And would be studious in thy guard, so nothing could be tried"
300,19,2789,"But care in me to keep thee safe, for that I could excuse,"
300,19,2790,"And vouch to all men.” These words past, he put the deeds in use"
300,19,2791,"For which Jove sent him; up he leapt to Priam’s chariot,"
300,19,2792,"Took scourge and reins, and blew in strength to his free steeds, and"
300,19,2793,got
300,19,2794,The naval tow’rs and deep dike straight. The guards were all at meat;
300,19,2795,"Those he enslumber’d, op’d the ports, and in he safely let"
300,19,2796,Old Priam with his wealthy prize. Forthwith they reach’d the tent
300,19,2797,"Of great Achilles, large and high, and in his most ascent"
300,19,2798,A shaggy roof of seedy reeds mown from the meads; a hall
300,19,2799,"Of state they made their king in it, and strengthen’d it withall"
300,19,2800,Thick with fir rafters; whose approach was let in by a door
300,19,2801,"That had but one bar, but so big that three men evermore"
300,19,2802,"Rais’d it to shut, three fresh take down; which yet Æacides"
300,19,2803,Would shut and ope himself. And this with far more ease
300,19,2804,"Hermes set ope, ent’ring the king; then leapt from horse, and said:"
300,19,2805,"“Now know, old king, that Mercury, a God, hath giv’n this aid"
300,19,2806,"To thy endeavour, sent by Jove; and now away must I,"
300,19,2807,For men would envy thy estate to see a Deity
300,19,2808,"Affect a man thus. Enter thou, embrace Achilles’ knee,"
300,19,2809,"And by his sire, son, mother, pray his ruth and grace to thee.”"
300,19,2810,"This said, he high Olympus reach’d. The king then left his coach"
300,19,2811,"To grave Idæus, and went on, made his resolv’d approach,"
300,19,2812,"And enter’d in a goodly room, where with his princes sate"
300,19,2813,"Jove - lov’d Achilles, at their feast; two only kept the state"
300,19,2814,"Of his attendance, Alcimus, and lord Automedon,"
300,19,2815,At Priam’s entry. A great time Achilles gaz’d upon
300,19,2816,"His wonder’d - at approach, nor ate; the rest did nothing see,"
300,19,2817,"While close he came up, with his hands fast holding the bent knee"
300,19,2818,"Of Hector’s conqueror, and kiss’d that large man - slaught’ring hand"
300,19,2819,"That much blood from his sons had drawn. And as in some strange land,"
300,19,2820,"And great man’s house, a man is driv’n (with that abhorr’d dismay"
300,19,2821,"That follows wilful bloodshed still, his fortune being to slay"
300,19,2822,"One whose blood cries aloud for his) to plead protectión,"
300,19,2823,In such a miserable plight as frights the lookers on;
300,19,2824,In such a stupefied estate Achilles sat to see
300,19,2825,"So unexpected, so in night, and so incredibly,"
300,19,2826,Old Priam’s entry. All his friends one on another star’d
300,19,2827,"To see his strange looks, seeing no cause. Thus Priam then prepar’d"
300,19,2828,"His son’s redemption: “See in me, O God - like Thetis’ son,"
300,19,2829,Thy aged father; and perhaps ev’n now being out - run
300,19,2830,"With some of my woes, neighbour foes (thou absent) taking time"
300,19,2831,To do him mischief; no mean left to terrify the crime
300,19,2832,"Of his oppression; yet he hears thy graces still survive,"
300,19,2833,"And joys to hear it, hoping still to see thee safe arrive"
300,19,2834,"From ruin’d Troy; but I, curs’d man, of all my race shall live"
300,19,2835,To see none living. Fifty sons the Deities did give
300,19,2836,My hopes to live in; all alive when near our trembling shore
300,19,2837,"The Greek ships harbour’d, and one womb nineteen of those sons bore."
300,19,2838,Now Mars a number of their knees hath strength less left; and he
300,19,2839,"That was, of all, my only joy, and Troy’s sole guard, by thee,"
300,19,2840,"Late fighting for his country, slain; whose tender’d person now"
300,19,2841,"I come to ransom. Infinite is that I offer you,"
300,19,2842,"Myself conferring it, expos’d alone to all your odds,"
300,19,2843,"Only imploring right of arms. Achilles! Fear the Gods,"
300,19,2844,"Pity an old man like thy sire; diff’rent in only this,"
300,19,2845,"That I am wretcheder, and bear that weight of miseries"
300,19,2846,"That never man did, my curs’d lips enforc’d to kiss that hand"
300,19,2847,"That slew my children.” This mov’d tears; his father’s name did stand,"
300,19,2848,"Mention’d by Priam, in much help to his compassion,"
300,19,2849,"And mov’d Æacides so much, he could not look upon"
300,19,2850,The weeping father. With his hand he gently put away
300,19,2851,His grave face. Calm remission now did mutually display
300,19,2852,"Her pow’r in either’s heaviness. Old Priam, to record"
300,19,2853,"His son’s death and his deathsman see, his tears and bosom pour’d"
300,19,2854,Before Achilles; at his feet he laid his rev’rend head.
300,19,2855,"Achilles’ thoughts, now with his sire, now with his friend, were fed."
300,19,2856,Betwixt both sorrow fill’d the tent. But now Æacides
300,19,2857,(Satiate at all parts with the ruth of their calamities)
300,19,2858,"Start up, and up he rais’d the king. His milk - white head and beard"
300,19,2859,"With pity he beheld, and said: “Poor man, thy mind is scar’d"
300,19,2860,With much afflictión. How durst thy person thus alone
300,19,2861,"Venture on his sight, that hath slain so many a worthy son,"
300,19,2862,"And so dear to thee? Thy old heart is made of iron. Sit,"
300,19,2863,"And settle we our woes, though huge, for nothing profits it."
300,19,2864,Cold mourning wastes but our lives’ heats. The Gods have destinate
300,19,2865,That wretched mortals must live sad; ’tis the Immortal State
300,19,2866,Of Deity that lives secure. Two tuns of gifts there lie
300,19,2867,"In Jove’s gate, one of good, one ill, that our mortality"
300,19,2868,"Maintain, spoil, order; which when Jove doth mix to any man,"
300,19,2869,"One while he frolics, one while mourns. If of his mournful can"
300,19,2870,"A man drinks only, only wrongs he doth expose him to,"
300,19,2871,"Sad hunger in th’ abundant earth doth toss him to and fro,"
300,19,2872,Respected nor of Gods nor men. The mix’d cup Peleus drank
300,19,2873,Ev’n from his birth; Heav’n blest his life; he liv’d not that could
300,19,2874,thank
300,19,2875,The Gods for such rare benefits as set forth his estate.
300,19,2876,"He reign’d among his Myrmidons most rich, most fortunate,"
300,19,2877,"And, though a mortal, had his bed deck’d with a deathless dame."
300,19,2878,"And yet, with all this good, one ill God mix’d, that takes all name"
300,19,2879,"From all that goodness; his name now, whose preservation here"
300,19,2880,"Men count the crown of their most good, not bless’d with pow’r to bear"
300,19,2881,"One blossom but myself, and I shaken as soon as blown;"
300,19,2882,"Nor shall I live to cheer his age, and give nutritión"
300,19,2883,"To him that nourish’d me. Far off my rest is set in Troy,"
300,19,2884,"To leave thee restless and thy seed; thyself that did enjoy,"
300,19,2885,"As we have heard, a happy life; what Lesbos doth contain,"
300,19,2886,"In times past being a bless’d man’s seat, what the unmeasur’d main"
300,19,2887,"Of Hellespontus, Phrygia, holds, are all said to adorn"
300,19,2888,"Thy empire, wealth and sons enow; but, when the Gods did turn"
300,19,2889,"Thy blest state to partake with bane, war and the bloods of men"
300,19,2890,"Circled thy city, never clear. Sit down and suffer then;"
300,19,2891,Mourn not inevitable things; thy tears can spring no deeds
300,19,2892,"To help thee, nor recall thy son; impatience ever breeds"
300,19,2893,"Ill upon ill, makes worst things worse, and therefore sit.” He said:"
300,19,2894,"“Give me no seat, great seed of Jove, when yet unransomed"
300,19,2895,"Hector lies riteless in thy tents, but deign with utmost speed"
300,19,2896,"His resignation, that these eyes may see his person freed,"
300,19,2897,"And thy grace satisfied with gifts. Accept what I have brought,"
300,19,2898,And turn to Phthia; ’tis enough thy conqu’ring hand hath fought
300,19,2899,"Till Hector falter’d under it, and Hector’s father stood"
300,19,2900,With free humanity safe.” He frown’d and said: “Give not my blood
300,19,2901,"Fresh cause of fury. I know well I must resign thy son,"
300,19,2902,Jove by my mother utter’d it; and what besides is done
300,19,2903,"I know as amply; and thyself, old Priam, I know too."
300,19,2904,Some God hath brought thee; for no man durst use a thought to go
300,19,2905,"On such a service. I have guards, and I have gates to stay"
300,19,2906,"Easy accesses; do not then presume thy will can sway,"
300,19,2907,"Like Jove’s will, and incense again my quench’d blood, lest nor thou"
300,19,2908,"Nor Jove get the command of me.” This made the old king bow,"
300,19,2909,"And down he sat in fear. The prince leapt like a lion forth,"
300,19,2910,Automedon and Alcimus attending: all the worth
300,19,2911,"Brought for the body they took down and brought in, and with it"
300,19,2912,"Idæus, herald to the king; a coat embroider’d yet,"
300,19,2913,"And two rich cloaks, they left to hide the person. Thetis’ son"
300,19,2914,"Call’d out his women, to anoint and quickly overrun"
300,19,2915,"The corse with water, lifting it in private to the coach,"
300,19,2916,"Lest Priam saw, and his cold blood embrac’d a fi’ry touch"
300,19,2917,"Of anger at the turpitude profaning it, and blew"
300,19,2918,"Again his wrath’s fire to his death. This done, his women threw"
300,19,2919,The coat and cloak on; but the corse Achilles’ own hand laid
300,19,2920,"Upon a bed, and with his friends to chariot it convey’d."
300,19,2921,"For which forc’d grace, abhorring so from his free mind, he wept,"
300,19,2922,"Cried out for anger, and thus pray’d: “O friend, do not except"
300,19,2923,"Against this favour to our foe, if in the deep thou hear,"
300,19,2924,And that I give him to his sire; he gave fair ransom; dear
300,19,2925,In my observance is Jove’s will; and whatsoever part
300,19,2926,Of all these gifts by any mean I fitly may convert
300,19,2927,"To thy renown here, and will there, it shall be pour’d upon"
300,19,2928,"Thy honour’d sepulchre. This said, he went, and what was done"
300,19,2929,"Told Priam, saying: “Father, now thy will’s fit rites are paid,"
300,19,2930,Thy son is giv’n up; in the morn thine eyes shall see him laid
300,19,2931,Deck’d in thy chariot on his bed; in mean space let us eat.
300,19,2932,"The rich - hair’d Niobe found thoughts that made her take her meat,"
300,19,2933,"Though twelve dear children she saw slain, six daughters, six young"
300,19,2934,sons.
300,19,2935,The sons incens’d Apollo slew; the maids’ confusions
300,19,2936,Diana wrought; since Niobe her merits durst compare
300,19,2937,"With great Latona’s, arguing that she did only bear"
300,19,2938,"Two children, and herself had twelve; for which those only two"
300,19,2939,"Slew all her twelve. Nine days they lay steep’d in their blood, her woe"
300,19,2940,"Found no friend to afford them fire, Saturnius had turn’d"
300,19,2941,"Humans to stones. The tenth day yet, the good Celestials burn’d"
300,19,2942,"The trunks themselves, and Niobe, when she was tir’d with tears,"
300,19,2943,"Fell to her food, and now with rocks and wild hills mix’d she bears"
300,19,2944,"In Sipylus the Gods’ wrath still, in that place where ’tis said"
300,19,2945,The Goddess Fairies use to dance about the fun’ral bed
300,19,2946,"Of Achelous, where, though turn’d with cold grief to a stone,"
300,19,2947,Heav’n gives her heat enough to feel what plague comparison
300,19,2948,With his pow’rs made by earth deserves. Affect not then too far
300,19,2949,"Without grief, like a God, being a man, but for a man’s life care,"
300,19,2950,And take fit food; thou shalt have time beside to mourn thy son;
300,19,2951,"He shall be tearful, thou being full; not here, but Ilion"
300,19,2952,"Shall find thee weeping - rooms enow.” He said, and so arose,"
300,19,2953,And caus’d a silver - fleec’d sheep kill’d; his friends’ skills did
300,19,2954,dispose
300,19,2955,"The flaying, cutting of it up, and cookly spitted it,"
300,19,2956,"Roasted, and drew it artfully. Automedon, as fit"
300,19,2957,Was for the rev’rend sewer’s place; and all the brown joints serv’d
300,19,2958,On wicker vessel to the board; Achilles’ own hands kerv’d;
300,19,2959,"And close they fell to. Hunger stanch’d; talk, and observing time,"
300,19,2960,Was us’d of all hands. Priam sat amaz’d to see the prime
300,19,2961,"Of Thetis’ son, accomplish’d so with stature, looks, and grace,"
300,19,2962,In which the fashion of a God he thought had chang’d his place.
300,19,2963,"Achilles fell to him as fast, admir’d as much his years"
300,19,2964,"Told in his grave and good aspect; his speech ev’n charm’d his ears,"
300,19,2965,"So order’d, so material. With this food feasted too,"
300,19,2966,"Old Priam spake thus: “Now, Jove’s seed, command that I may go,"
300,19,2967,"And add to this feast grace of rest. These lids ne’er clos’d mine eyes,"
300,19,2968,"Since under thy hands fled the soul of my dear son; sighs, cries,"
300,19,2969,"And woes, all use from food and sleep have taken; the base courts"
300,19,2970,"Of my sad palace made my beds, where all the abject sorts"
300,19,2971,"Of sorrow I have variéd, tumbled in dust, and hid;"
300,19,2972,"No bit, no drop, of sust’nance touch’d.” Then did Achilles bid"
300,19,2973,"His men and women see his bed laid down, and coveréd"
300,19,2974,"With purple blankets, and on them an arras coverlid,"
300,19,2975,"Waistcoats of silk plush laying by. The women straight took lights,"
300,19,2976,"And two beds made with utmost speed, and all the other rites"
300,19,2977,"Their lord nam’d us’d, who pleasantly the king in hand thus bore:"
300,19,2978,"“Good father, you must sleep without; lest any counsellor"
300,19,2979,"Make his access in depth of night, as oft their industry"
300,19,2980,Brings them t’ impart our war - affairs; of whom should any eye
300,19,2981,"Discern your presence, his next steps to Agamemnon fly,"
300,19,2982,"And then shall I lose all these gifts. But go to, signify,"
300,19,2983,"And that with truth, how many days you mean to keep the state"
300,19,2984,Of Hector’s funerals; because so long would I rebate
300,19,2985,"Mine own edge set to sack your town, and all our host contain"
300,19,2986,From interruption of your rites.” He answer’d: “If you mean
300,19,2987,"To suffer such rites to my son, you shall perform a part"
300,19,2988,Of most grace to me. But you know with how dismay’d a heart
300,19,2989,Our host took Troy; and how much fear will therefore apprehend
300,19,2990,"Their spirits to make out again, so far as we must send"
300,19,2991,For wood to raise our heap of death; unless I may assure
300,19,2992,"That this your high grace will stand good, and make their pass secure;"
300,19,2993,"Which if you seriously confirm, nine days I mean to mourn;"
300,19,2994,The tenth keep funeral and feast; th’ eleventh raise and adorn
300,19,2995,"My son’s fit sepulchre; the twelfth, if we must needs, we’ll fight.”"
300,19,2996,"“Be it,” replied Æacides, “do Hector all this right;"
300,19,2997,"I’ll hold war back those whole twelve days; of which, to free all fear,"
300,19,2998,"Take this my right hand.” This confirm’d, the old king rested there;"
300,19,2999,His herald lodg’d by him; and both in forepart of the tent;
300,19,3000,"Achilles in an inmost room of wondrous ornament,"
300,19,3001,Whose side bright - cheek’d Briseis warm’d. Soft sleep tam’d Gods and
300,19,3002,"men,"
300,19,3003,All but most - useful Mercury; sleep could not lay one chain
300,19,3004,"On his quick temples, taking care for getting off again"
300,19,3005,Engagéd Priam undiscern’d of those that did maintain
300,19,3006,The sacred watch. Above his head he stood with this demand:
300,19,3007,"“O father, sleep’st thou so secure, still lying in the hand"
300,19,3008,"Of so much ill, and being dismiss’d by great Æacides?"
300,19,3009,"’Tis true thou hast redeem’d the dead; but for thy life’s release,"
300,19,3010,"Should Agamemnon hear thee here, three times the price now paid"
300,19,3011,"Thy sons’ hands must repay for thee.” This said, the king, afraid,"
300,19,3012,"Start from his sleep, Idæus call’d, and, for both, Mercury"
300,19,3013,"The horse and mules, before loos’d, join’d so soft and curiously"
300,19,3014,"That no ear heard, and through the host drave; but when they drew"
300,19,3015,"To gulfy Xanthus’ bright - wav’d stream, up to Olympus flew"
300,19,3016,"Industrious Mercury. And now the saffron Morning rose,"
300,19,3017,"Spreading her white robe over all the world; when, full of woes,"
300,19,3018,"They scourg’d on with the corse to Troy, from whence no eye had seen,"
300,19,3019,"Before Cassandra, their return. She, like love’s golden Queen,"
300,19,3020,"Ascending Pergamus, discern’d her father’s person nigh,"
300,19,3021,"His herald, and her brother’s corse; and then she cast this cry"
300,19,3022,"Round about Troy: “O Trojans, if ever ye did greet"
300,19,3023,"Hector return’d from fight alive, now look ye out and meet"
300,19,3024,"His ransom’d person. Then his worth was all your city’s joy,"
300,19,3025,Now do it honour.” Out all rush’d; woman nor man in Troy
300,19,3026,"Was left, a most unmeasur’d cry took up their voices. Close"
300,19,3027,To Scæa’s ports they met the corse; and to it headlong goes
300,19,3028,"The rev’rend mother, the dear wife; upon it strow their hair,"
300,19,3029,And lie entrancéd. Round about the people broke the air
300,19,3030,"In lamentations; and all day had stay’d the people there,"
300,19,3031,"If Priam had not cried “Give way, give me but leave to bear"
300,19,3032,"The body home, and mourn your fills.” Then cleft the press, and gave"
300,19,3033,Way to the chariot. To the court herald Idæus drave
300,19,3034,"Where on a rich bed they bestow’d the honour’d person, round"
300,19,3035,Girt it with singers that the woe with skilful voices crown’d.
300,19,3036,"A woeful elegy they sung, wept singing, and the dames"
300,19,3037,Sigh’d as they sung. Andromache the downright prose exclaims
300,19,3038,"Began to all; she on the neck of slaughter’d Hector fell,"
300,19,3039,"And cried out: “O my husband, thou in youth bad’st youth farewell,"
300,19,3040,"Left’st me a widow, thy sole son an infant; ourselves curs’d"
300,19,3041,In our birth made him right our child: for all my care that nurs’d
300,19,3042,"His infancy will never give life to his youth, ere that"
300,19,3043,"Troy from her top will be destroy’d; thou guardian of our state,"
300,19,3044,"Thou ev’n of all her strength the strength, thou, that in care wert"
300,19,3045,past
300,19,3046,"Her careful mothers of their babes, being gone, how can she last?"
300,19,3047,"Soon will the swoln fleet fill her womb with all their servitude,"
300,19,3048,"Myself with them, and thou with me, dear son, in labours rude"
300,19,3049,"Shalt be employ’d, sternly survey’d by cruel conquerors;"
300,19,3050,"Or, rage not suff’ring life so long, some one, whose hate abhors"
300,19,3051,"Thy presence (putting him in mind of his sire slain by thine,"
300,19,3052,"His brother, son, or friend) shall work thy ruin before mine,"
300,19,3053,"Toss’d from some tow’r, for many Greeks have ate earth from the hand"
300,19,3054,"Of thy strong father; in sad fight his spirit was too much mann’d,"
300,19,3055,"And therefore mourn his people; we, thy parents, my dear lord,"
300,19,3056,"For that thou mak’st endure a woe, black, and to be abhorr’d."
300,19,3057,"Of all yet thou hast left me worst, not dying in thy bed,"
300,19,3058,"And reaching me thy last - rais’d hand, in nothing counselléd"
300,19,3059,Nothing commanded by that pow’r thou hadst of me to do
300,19,3060,"Some deed for thy sake. O for these never will end my woe,"
300,19,3061,"Never my tears cease.” Thus wept she, and all the ladies clos’d"
300,19,3062,Her passion with a gen’ral shriek. Then Hecuba dispos’d
300,19,3063,"Her thoughts in like words; “O my son, of all mine much most dear,"
300,19,3064,"Dear while thou liv’dst too ev’n to Gods, and after death they were"
300,19,3065,"Careful to save thee. Being best, thou most wert envied;"
300,19,3066,My other sons Achilles sold; but thee he left not dead.
300,19,3067,"Imber and Samos, the false ports of Lemnos entertain’d"
300,19,3068,"Their persons; thine, no port but death. Nor there in rest remain’d"
300,19,3069,"Thy violated corse, the tomb of his great friend was spher’d"
300,19,3070,With thy dragg’d person; yet from death he was not therefore rear’d
300,19,3071,"But, all his rage us’d, so the Gods have tender’d thy dead state,"
300,19,3072,"Thou liest as living, sweet and fresh, as he that felt the fate"
300,19,3073,"Of Phœbus’ holy shafts.” These words the queen us’d for her moan,"
300,19,3074,"And, next her, Helen held that state of speech and passión:"
300,19,3075,"“O Hector, all my brothers more were not so lov’d of me"
300,19,3076,"As thy most virtues. Not my lord I held so dear, as thee,"
300,19,3077,That brought me hither; before which I would I had been brought
300,19,3078,To ruin; for what breeds that wish (which is the mischief wrought
300,19,3079,"By my access) yet never found one harsh taunt, one word’s ill,"
300,19,3080,From thy sweet carriage. Twenty years do now their circles fill
300,19,3081,Since my arrival; all which time thou didst not only bear
300,19,3082,"Thyself without check, but all else, that my lord’s brothers were,"
300,19,3083,"Their sisters’ lords, sisters themselves, the queen my mother - in - law,"
300,19,3084,(The king being never but most mild) when thy man’s spirit saw
300,19,3085,"Sour and reproachful, it would still reprove their bitterness"
300,19,3086,"With sweet words, and thy gentle soul. And therefore thy decease"
300,19,3087,I truly mourn for; and myself curse as the wretched cause;
300,19,3088,"All broad Troy yielding me not one, that any human laws"
300,19,3089,"Of pity or forgiveness mov’d t’entreat me humanly,"
300,19,3090,"But only thee, all else abhorr’d me for my destiny.”"
300,19,3091,These words made ev’n the commons mourn; to whom the king said:
300,19,3092,"“Friends,"
300,19,3093,"Now fetch wood for our fun’ral fire, nor fear the foe intends"
300,19,3094,"Ambush, or any violence; Achilles gave his word,"
300,19,3095,"At my dismission, that twelve days he would keep sheath’d his sword,"
300,19,3096,"And all men’s else.” Thus oxen, mules, in chariots straight they put,"
300,19,3097,Went forth and an unmeasur’d pile of sylvan matter cut;
300,19,3098,"Nine days employ’d in carriage, but when the tenth morn shin’d"
300,19,3099,"On wretched mortals, then they brought the fit - to - be - divin’d"
300,19,3100,Forth to be burn’d. Troy swum in tears. Upon the pile’s most height
300,19,3101,"They laid the person, and gave fire. All day it burn’d, all night."
300,19,3102,"But when th’ elev’nth morn let on earth her rosy fingers shine,"
300,19,3103,"The people flock’d about the pile, and first with blackish wine"
300,19,3104,"Quench’d all the flames. His brothers then, and friends, the snowy"
300,19,3105,bones
300,19,3106,"Gather’d into an urn of gold, still pouring on their moans."
300,19,3107,"Then wrapt they in soft purple veils the rich urn, digg’d a pit,"
300,19,3108,"Grav’d it, ramm’d up the grave with stones, and quickly built to it"
300,19,3109,"A sepulchre. But, while that work and all the fun’ral rites"
300,19,3110,"Were in performance, guards were held at all parts, days and nights,"
300,19,3111,For fear of false surprise before they had impos’d the crown
300,19,3112,"To these solemnities. The tomb advanc’d once, all the town"
300,19,3113,In Jove - nurs’d Priam’s Court partook a passing sumptuous feast.
300,19,3114,And so horse - taming Hector’s rites gave up his soul to rest.
300,19,3115,THE END OF THE TWENTY - FOURTH BOOK.
400,1,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,1,2,"The Gods in council sit, to call"
400,1,3,"Ulysses from Calypso’s thrall,"
400,1,4,And order their high pleasures thus:
400,1,5,Grey Pallas to Telemachus
400,1,6,(In Ithaca) her way addrest;
400,1,7,And did her heav’nly limbs invest
400,1,8,"In Mentas’ likeness, that did reign"
400,1,9,"King of the Taphians, in the main"
400,1,10,Whose rough waves near Leucadia run.
400,1,11,Advising wise Ulysses’ son
400,1,12,"To seek his father, and address"
400,1,13,"His course to young Tantalides,"
400,1,14,"That govern’d Sparta. Thus much said,"
400,1,15,"She shew’d she was Heav’n’s martial Maid,"
400,1,16,"And vanish’d from him. Next to this,"
400,1,17,The Banquet of the Wooers is.
400,1,18,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,1,19,_Ἂλφα._
400,1,20,The Deities sit;
400,1,21,The Man retired;
400,1,22,Th’ Ulyssean wit
400,1,23,By Pallas fired.
400,1,24,"The man, O Muse, inform, that many a way[1]"
400,1,25,Wound with his wisdom to his wished stay;
400,1,26,"That wander’d wondrous far, when he the town"
400,1,27,Of sacred Troy had sack’d and shiver’d down;
400,1,28,"The cities of a world of nations,"
400,1,29,"With all their manners, minds, and fashions,"
400,1,30,"He saw and knew; at sea felt many woes,"
400,1,31,"Much care sustain’d, to save from overthrows"
400,1,32,Himself and friends in their retreat for home;
400,1,33,"But so their fates he could not overcome,"
400,1,34,"Though much he thirsted it. O men unwise,"
400,1,35,They perish’d by their own impieties!
400,1,36,That in their hunger’s rapine would not shun
400,1,37,"The oxen of the lofty - going Sun,"
400,1,38,Who therefore from their eyes the day bereft
400,1,39,"Of safe return. These acts, in some part left,"
400,1,40,"Tell us, as others, deified Seed of Jove."
400,1,41,Now all the rest that austere death outstrove
400,1,42,"At Troy’s long siege at home safe anchor’d are,"
400,1,43,Free from the malice both of sea and war;
400,1,44,Only Ulysses is denied access
400,1,45,"To wife and home. The grace of Goddesses,"
400,1,46,"The rev’rend nymph Calypso, did detain"
400,1,47,"Him in her caves, past all the race of men"
400,1,48,Enflam’d to make him her lov’d lord and spouse.
400,1,49,"And when the Gods had destin’d that his house,"
400,1,50,"Which Ithaca on her rough bosom bears,"
400,1,51,(The point of time wrought out by ambient years)
400,1,52,"Should be his haven, Contention still extends"
400,1,53,"Her envy to him, ev’n amongst his friends."
400,1,54,"All Gods took pity on him; only he,"
400,1,55,"That girds earth in the cincture of the sea,"
400,1,56,"Divine Ulysses ever did envy,"
400,1,57,And made the fix’d port of his birth to fly.
400,1,58,But he himself solemniz’d a retreat
400,1,59,"To th’ Æthiops, far dissunder’d in their seat,"
400,1,60,"(In two parts parted, at the sun’s descent,"
400,1,61,"And underneath his golden orient,"
400,1,62,The first and last of men) t’ enjoy their feast
400,1,63,"Of bulls and lambs, in hecatombs addrest;[2]"
400,1,64,"At which he sat, giv’n over to delight."
400,1,65,The other Gods in heav’n’s supremest height
400,1,66,Were all in council met; to whom began
400,1,67,The mighty Father both of God and man
400,1,68,"Discourse, inducing matter that inclin’d"
400,1,69,"To wise Ulysses, calling to his mind"
400,1,70,"Faultful Ægisthus, who to death was done[3]"
400,1,71,"By young Orestes, Agamemnon’s son."
400,1,72,His memory to the Immortals then
400,1,73,Mov’d Jove thus deeply: “O how falsely men
400,1,74,Accuse us Gods as authors of their ill!
400,1,75,"When, by the bane their own bad lives instill,"
400,1,76,"They suffer all the mis’ries of their states,"
400,1,77,"Past our inflictions, and beyond their fates."
400,1,78,"As now Ægisthus, past his fate, did wed"
400,1,79,"The wife of Agamemnon, and (in dread"
400,1,80,"To suffer death himself) to shun his ill,"
400,1,81,"Incurr’d it by the loose bent of his will,"
400,1,82,In slaughtering Atrides in retreat.
400,1,83,Which we foretold him would so hardly set
400,1,84,"To his murd’rous purpose, sending Mercury"
400,1,85,"That slaughter’d Argus, our consid’rate spy,"
400,1,86,"To give him this charge: ‘Do not wed his wife,"
400,1,87,Nor murder him; for thou shalt buy his life
400,1,88,"With ransom of thine own, impos’d on thee"
400,1,89,"By his Orestes, when in him shall be"
400,1,90,"Atrides’ - self renew’d, and but the prime"
400,1,91,"Of youth’s spring put abroad, in thirst to climb"
400,1,92,His haughty father’s throne by his high acts.’
400,1,93,These words of Hermes wrought not into facts
400,1,94,"Ægisthus’ powers; good counsel he despis’d,"
400,1,95,And to that good his ill is sacrific’d.”
400,1,96,"Pallas, whose eyes did sparkle like the skies,"
400,1,97,"Answer’d: “O Sire! Supreme of Deities,"
400,1,98,"Ægisthus pass’d his fate, and had desert"
400,1,99,To warrant our infliction; and convert
400,1,100,May all the pains such impious men inflict
400,1,101,"On innocent suff’rers to revenge as strict,"
400,1,102,"Their own hearts eating. But, that Ithacus,"
400,1,103,"Thus never meriting, should suffer thus,"
400,1,104,I deeply suffer. His more pious mind
400,1,105,Divides him from these fortunes. Though unkind
400,1,106,"Is piety to him, giving him a fate"
400,1,107,"More suff’ring than the most unfortunate,"
400,1,108,"So long kept friendless in a sea - girt soil,"
400,1,109,"Where the sea’s navel is a sylvan isle,"
400,1,110,In which the Goddess dwells that doth derive
400,1,111,"Her birth from Atlas, who of all alive"
400,1,112,The motion and the fashion doth command
400,1,113,"With his wise mind, whose forces understand[4]"
400,1,114,"The inmost deeps and gulfs of all the seas,"
400,1,115,Who (for his skill of things superior) stays
400,1,116,The two steep columns that prop earth and heav’n.
400,1,117,"His daughter ‘tis, who holds this homeless - driv’n[5]"
400,1,118,Still mourning with her; evermore profuse
400,1,119,"Of soft and winning speeches, that abuse"
400,1,120,"And make so languishingly, and possest[6]"
400,1,121,"With so remiss a mind her loved guest,"
400,1,122,Manage the action of his way for home.
400,1,123,"Where he, though in affection overcome,"
400,1,124,In judgment yet more longs to show his hopes
400,1,125,"His country’s smoke leap from her chimney tops,"
400,1,126,And death asks in her arms. Yet never shall
400,1,127,"Thy lov’d heart be converted on his thrall,"
400,1,128,"Austere Olympius. Did not ever he,"
400,1,129,"In ample Troy, thy altars gratify,"
400,1,130,And Grecians’ fleet make in thy off’rings swim?
400,1,131,"Jove, why still then burns thy wrath to him?”"
400,1,132,"The Cloud - assembler answer’d: “What words fly,"
400,1,133,"Bold daughter, from thy pale of ivory?[7]"
400,1,134,As if I ever could cast from my care
400,1,135,"Divine Ulysses, who exceeds so far"
400,1,136,"All men in wisdom, and so oft hath giv’n"
400,1,137,To all th’ Immortals thron’d in ample heav’n
400,1,138,"So great and sacred gifts? But his decrees,"
400,1,139,"That holds the earth in with his nimble knees,"
400,1,140,"Stand to Ulysses’ longings so extreme,"
400,1,141,For taking from the God - foe Polypheme
400,1,142,"His only eye; a Cyclop, that excell’d"
400,1,143,"All other Cyclops, with whose burden swell’d"
400,1,144,"The nymph Thoosa, the divine increase"
400,1,145,"Of Phorcys’ seed, a great God of the seas."
400,1,146,"She mix’d with Neptune in his hollow caves,"
400,1,147,And bore this Cyclop to that God of waves.
400,1,148,"For whose lost eye, th’ Earth - shaker did not kill"
400,1,149,"Erring Ulysses, but reserves him still"
400,1,150,"In life for more death. But use we our pow’rs,"
400,1,151,"And round about us cast these cares of ours,"
400,1,152,All to discover how we may prefer
400,1,153,"His wish’d retreat, and Neptune make forbear"
400,1,154,"His stern eye to him, since no one God can,"
400,1,155,"In spite of all, prevail, but ’gainst a man.”"
400,1,156,"To this, this answer made the grey - eyed Maid:"
400,1,157,"“Supreme of rulers, since so well apaid"
400,1,158,"The blesséd Gods are all then, now, in thee,"
400,1,159,"To limit wise Ulysses’ misery,"
400,1,160,And that you speak as you referr’d to me
400,1,161,"Prescription for the means, in this sort be"
400,1,162,Their sacred order: Let us now address
400,1,163,"With utmost speed our swift Argicides,"
400,1,164,To tell the nymph that bears the golden tress
400,1,165,"In th’ isle Ogygia, that ’tis our will"
400,1,166,"She should not stay our lov’d Ulysses still,"
400,1,167,But suffer his return; and then will I
400,1,168,"To Ithaca, to make his son apply"
400,1,169,His sire’s inquest the more; infusing force
400,1,170,"Into his soul, to summon the concourse"
400,1,171,"Of curl’d - head Greeks to council, and deter"
400,1,172,"Each wooer, that hath been the slaughterer"
400,1,173,Of his fat sheep and crooked - headed beeves.
400,1,174,"From more wrong to his mother, and their leaves"
400,1,175,Take in such terms as fit deserts so great.
400,1,176,"To Sparta then, and Pylos, where doth beat"
400,1,177,"Bright Amathus, the flood, and epithet"
400,1,178,"To all that kingdom, my advice shall send"
400,1,179,"The spirit - advanc’d Prince, to the pious end"
400,1,180,"Of seeking his lost father, if he may"
400,1,181,Receive report from Fame where rests his stay;
400,1,182,"And make, besides, his own successive worth"
400,1,183,"Known to the world, and set in action forth.”"
400,1,184,"This said, her wing’d shoes to her feet she tied,"
400,1,185,"Form’d all of gold, and all eternified,"
400,1,186,That on the round earth or the sea sustain’d
400,1,187,Her ravish’d substance swift as gusts of wind.
400,1,188,"Then took she her strong lance with steel made keen,"
400,1,189,"Great, massy, active, that whole hosts of men,"
400,1,190,"Though all heroës, conquers, if her ire"
400,1,191,"Their wrongs inflame, back’d by so great a Sire."
400,1,192,"Down from Olympus’ tops she headlong div’d,"
400,1,193,"And swift as thought in Ithaca arriv’d,"
400,1,194,Close at Ulysses’ gates; in whose first court
400,1,195,"She made her stand, and, for her breast’s support,"
400,1,196,Lean’d on her iron lance; her form imprest
400,1,197,"With Mentas’ likeness, come as being a guest."
400,1,198,"There found she those proud wooers, that were then"
400,1,199,"Set on those ox - hides that themselves had slain,"
400,1,200,"Before the gates, and all at dice were playing."
400,1,201,"To them the heralds, and the rest obeying,"
400,1,202,"Fill’d wine and water; some, still as they play’d,"
400,1,203,"And some, for solemn supper’s state, purvey’d,"
400,1,204,"With porous sponges cleansing tables, serv’d"
400,1,205,With much rich feast; of which to all they kerv’d.
400,1,206,"God - like Telemachus amongst them sat,"
400,1,207,Griev’d much in mind; and in his heart begat
400,1,208,"All representment of his absent sire,"
400,1,209,"How, come from far - off parts, his spirits would fire"
400,1,210,"With those proud wooers’ sight, with slaughter parting"
400,1,211,"Their bold concourse, and to himself converting"
400,1,212,"The honours they usurp’d, his own commanding."
400,1,213,"In this discourse, he first saw Pallas standing,"
400,1,214,"Unbidden entry; up rose, and addrest"
400,1,215,"His pace right to her, angry that a guest"
400,1,216,"Should stand so long at gate; and, coming near,"
400,1,217,"Her right hand took, took in his own her spear,"
400,1,218,"And thus saluted: “Grace to your repair,"
400,1,219,"Fair guest, your welcome shall be likewise fair."
400,1,220,"Enter, and, cheer’d with feast, disclose th’ intent"
400,1,221,"That caus’d your coming.” This said, first he went,"
400,1,222,"And Pallas follow’d. To a room they came,"
400,1,223,"Steep, and of state; the jav’lin of the Dame"
400,1,224,"He set against a pillar vast and high,"
400,1,225,"Amidst a large and bright - kept armory,"
400,1,226,"Which was, besides, with woods of lances grac’d"
400,1,227,Of his grave father’s. In a throne he plac’d
400,1,228,"The man - turn’d Goddess, under which was spread"
400,1,229,"A carpet, rich and of deviceful thread;"
400,1,230,A footstool staying her feet; and by her chair
400,1,231,"Another seat (all garnish’d wondrous fair,"
400,1,232,"To rest or sleep on in the day) he set,"
400,1,233,"Far from the prease of wooers, lest at meat"
400,1,234,"The noise they still made might offend his guest,"
400,1,235,"Disturbing him at banquet or at rest,"
400,1,236,"Ev’n to his combat with that pride of theirs,"
400,1,237,That kept no noble form in their affairs.
400,1,238,"And these he set far from them, much the rather"
400,1,239,To question freely of his absent father.
400,1,240,"A table fairly - polish’d then was spread,"
400,1,241,"On which a rev’rend officer set bread,"
400,1,242,And other servitors all sorts of meat
400,1,243,"(Salads, and flesh, such as their haste could get)"
400,1,244,Serv’d with observance in. And then the sewer
400,1,245,"Pour’d water from a great and golden ewer,"
400,1,246,That from their hands t’ a silver caldron ran.
400,1,247,"Both wash’d, and seated close, the voiceful man"
400,1,248,"Fetch’d cups of gold, and set by them, and round"
400,1,249,Those cups with wine with all endeavour crown’d.
400,1,250,"Then rush’d in the rude wooers, themselves plac’d;"
400,1,251,The heralds water gave; the maids in haste
400,1,252,"Serv’d bread from baskets. When, of all prepar’d"
400,1,253,"And set before them, the bold wooers shar’d,"
400,1,254,Their pages plying their cups past the rest.
400,1,255,But lusty wooers must do more than feast;
400,1,256,"For now, their hungers and their thirsts allay’d,"
400,1,257,"They call’d for songs and dances; those, they said,"
400,1,258,Were th’ ornaments of feast. The herald straight
400,1,259,"A harp, carv’d full of artificial sleight,"
400,1,260,"Thrust into Phemius’, a learn’d singer’s, hand,"
400,1,261,"Who, till he much was urg’d, on terms did stand,"
400,1,262,"But, after, play’d and sung with all his art."
400,1,263,"Telemachus to Pallas then (apart,"
400,1,264,"His ear inclining close, that none might hear)"
400,1,265,"In this sort said: “My guest, exceeding dear,"
400,1,266,Will you not sit incens’d with what I say?
400,1,267,These are the cares these men take; feast and play.
400,1,268,"Which eas’ly they may use, because they eat,"
400,1,269,"Free and unpunish’d, of another’s meat;"
400,1,270,"And of a man’s, whose white bones wasting lie"
400,1,271,In some far region; with th’ incessancy
400,1,272,"Of show’rs pour’d down upon them, lying ashore,"
400,1,273,"Or in the seas wash’d nak’d. Who, if he wore"
400,1,274,"Those bones with flesh and life and industry,"
400,1,275,And these might here in Ithaca set eye
400,1,276,"On him return’d, they all would wish to be"
400,1,277,Either past other in celerity
400,1,278,"Of feet and knees, and not contend t’ exceed"
400,1,279,In golden garments. But his virtues feed
400,1,280,The fate of ill death; nor is left to me
400,1,281,"The least hope of his life’s recovery,"
400,1,282,"No, not if any of the mortal race"
400,1,283,Should tell me his return; the cheerful face
400,1,284,Of his return’d day never will appear.
400,1,285,"But tell me, and let Truth your witness bear,"
400,1,286,"Who, and from whence you are? What city’s birth?"
400,1,287,What parents? In what vessel set you forth?
400,1,288,And with what mariners arriv’d you here?
400,1,289,I cannot think you a foot passenger.
400,1,290,"Recount then to me all, to teach me well"
400,1,291,Fit usage for your worth. And if it fell
400,1,292,"In chance now first that you thus see us here,"
400,1,293,Or that in former passages you were
400,1,294,My father’s guest? For many men have been
400,1,295,Guests to my father. Studious of men
400,1,296,His sociable nature ever was.”
400,1,297,On him again the grey - eyed Maid did pass
400,1,298,This kind reply: “I’ll answer passing true
400,1,299,All thou hast ask’d: My birth his honour drew
400,1,300,From wise Anchialus. The name I bear
400,1,301,"Is Mentas, the commanding islander"
400,1,302,Of all the Taphians studious in the art
400,1,303,Of navigation; having touch’d this part
400,1,304,"With ship and men, of purpose to maintain"
400,1,305,Course through the dark seas t’ other - languag’d men;
400,1,306,And Temesis sustains the city’s name
400,1,307,"For which my ship is bound, made known by fame"
400,1,308,"For rich in brass, which my occasions need,"
400,1,309,"And therefore bring I shining steel in stead,"
400,1,310,"Which their use wants, yet makes my vessel’s freight,"
400,1,311,"That near a plough’d field rides at anchor’s weight,"
400,1,312,"Apart this city, in the harbour call’d"
400,1,313,"Rhethrus, whose waves with Neius’ woods are wall’d."
400,1,314,"Thy sire and I were ever mutual guests,"
400,1,315,At either’s house still interchanging feasts.
400,1,316,"I glory in it. Ask, when thou shalt see"
400,1,317,"Laertes, th’ old heroë, these of me,"
400,1,318,"From the beginning. He, men say, no more"
400,1,319,"Visits the city, but will needs deplore"
400,1,320,His son’s believ’d loss in a private field;
400,1,321,One old maid only at his hands to yield
400,1,322,"Food to his life, as oft as labour makes"
400,1,323,"His old limbs faint; which, though he creeps, he takes"
400,1,324,"Along a fruitful plain, set all with vines,"
400,1,325,"Which husbandman - like, though a king, he proins."
400,1,326,But now I come to be thy father’s guest;
400,1,327,"I hear he wanders, while these wooers feast."
400,1,328,And (as th’ Immortals prompt me at this hour)
400,1,329,"I’ll tell thee, out of a prophetic pow’r,"
400,1,330,"(Not as profess’d a prophet, nor clear seen"
400,1,331,At all times what shall after chance to men)
400,1,332,"What I conceive, for this time, will be true:"
400,1,333,The Gods’ inflictions keep your sire from you.
400,1,334,"Divine Ulysses, yet, abides not dead"
400,1,335,"Above earth, nor beneath, nor buried"
400,1,336,"In any seas, as you did late conceive,"
400,1,337,"But, with the broad sea sieg’d, is kept alive"
400,1,338,"Within an isle by rude and upland men,"
400,1,339,That in his spite his passage home detain.
400,1,340,Yet long it shall not be before he tread
400,1,341,"His country’s dear earth, though solicited,"
400,1,342,"And held from his return, with iron chains;"
400,1,343,"For he hath wit to forge a world of trains,"
400,1,344,"And will, of all, be sure to make good one"
400,1,345,"For his return, so much relied upon."
400,1,346,"But tell me, and be true: Art thou indeed"
400,1,347,"So much a son, as to be said the seed[8]"
400,1,348,Of Ithacus himself? Exceeding much
400,1,349,Thy forehead and fair eyes at his form touch;
400,1,350,"For oftentimes we met, as you and I"
400,1,351,"Meet at this hour, before he did apply"
400,1,352,"His pow’rs for Troy, when other Grecian states"
400,1,353,In hollow ships were his associates.
400,1,354,"But, since that time, mine eyes could never see"
400,1,355,"Renown’d Ulysses, nor met his with me.”"
400,1,356,The wise Telemachus again replied:
400,1,357,“You shall with all I know be satisfied.
400,1,358,My mother certain says I am his son;
400,1,359,I know not; nor was ever simply known
400,1,360,By any child the sure truth of his sire.
400,1,361,But would my veins had took in living fire
400,1,362,"From some man happy, rather than one wise,"
400,1,363,Whom age might see seis’d of what youth made prise.
400,1,364,But he whoever of the mortal race
400,1,365,"Is most unblest, he holds my father’s place."
400,1,366,"This, since you ask, I answer.” She, again:"
400,1,367,“The Gods sure did not make the future strain
400,1,368,"Both of thy race and days obscure to thee,"
400,1,369,Since thou wert born so of Penelope.
400,1,370,"The style may by thy after acts be won,"
400,1,371,Of so great sire the high undoubted son.
400,1,372,Say truth in this then: What’s this feasting here?
400,1,373,What all this rout? Is all this nuptial cheer?
400,1,374,Or else some friendly banquet made by thee?
400,1,375,"For here no shots are, where all sharers be."
400,1,376,Past measure contumeliously this crew
400,1,377,Fare through thy house; which should th’ ingenuous view
400,1,378,"Of any good or wise man come and find,"
400,1,379,(Impiety seeing play’d in ev’ry kind)
400,1,380,He could not but through ev’ry vein be mov’d.”
400,1,381,Again Telemachus: “My guest much lov’d.
400,1,382,"Since you demand and sift these sights so far,"
400,1,383,"I grant ’twere fit a house so regular,"
400,1,384,"Rich, and so faultless once in government,"
400,1,385,Should still at all parts the same form present
400,1,386,That gave it glory while her lord was here.
400,1,387,"But now the Gods, that us displeasure bear,"
400,1,388,"Have otherwise appointed, and disgrace"
400,1,389,My father most of all the mortal race.
400,1,390,"For whom I could not mourn so were he dead,"
400,1,391,Amongst his fellow - captains slaughteréd
400,1,392,"By common enemies, or in the hands"
400,1,393,"Of his kind friends had ended his commands,"
400,1,394,After he had egregiously bestow’d
400,1,395,"His pow’r and order in a war so vow’d,"
400,1,396,"And to his tomb all Greeks their grace had done,"
400,1,397,That to all ages he might leave his son
400,1,398,Immortal honour; but now Harpies have
400,1,399,Digg’d in their gorges his abhorréd grave.
400,1,400,"Obscure, inglorious, death hath made his end,"
400,1,401,"And me, for glories, to all griefs contend."
400,1,402,"Nor shall I any more mourn him alone,"
400,1,403,The Gods have giv’n me other cause of moan.
400,1,404,For look how many optimates remain
400,1,405,"In Samos, or the shores Dulichian,"
400,1,406,"Shady Zacynthus, or how many bear"
400,1,407,Rule in the rough brows of this island here;
400,1,408,So many now my mother and this house
400,1,409,At all parts make defam’d and ruinous;
400,1,410,"And she her hateful nuptials nor denies,"
400,1,411,"Nor will despatch their importunities,"
400,1,412,Though she beholds them spoil still as they feast
400,1,413,"All my free house yields, and the little rest"
400,1,414,Of my dead sire in me perhaps intend
400,1,415,To bring ere long to some untimely end.”
400,1,416,"This Pallas sigh’d and answer’d: “O,” said she,"
400,1,417,"“Absent Ulysses is much miss’d by thee,"
400,1,418,That on these shameless suitors he might lay
400,1,419,"His wreakful hands. Should he now come, and stay"
400,1,420,"In thy court’s first gates, arm’d with helm and shield,"
400,1,421,"And two such darts as I have seen him wield,"
400,1,422,"When first I saw him in our Taphian court,"
400,1,423,"Feasting, and doing his desert’s disport;"
400,1,424,When from Ephyrus he return’d by us
400,1,425,"From Ilus, son to Centaur Mermerus,"
400,1,426,"To whom he travell’d through the wat’ry dreads,"
400,1,427,"For bane to poison his sharp arrows’ heads,"
400,1,428,"That death, but touch’d, caus’d; which he would not give,"
400,1,429,Because he fear’d the Gods that ever live
400,1,430,Would plague such death with death; and yet their fear
400,1,431,Was to my father’s bosom not so dear
400,1,432,As was thy father’s love; (for what he sought
400,1,433,My loving father found him to a thought.)
400,1,434,If such as then Ulysses might but meet
400,1,435,"With these proud wooers, all were at his feet"
400,1,436,"But instant dead men, and their nuptialls"
400,1,437,Would prove as bitter as their dying galls.
400,1,438,"But these things in the Gods’ knees are repos’d,"
400,1,439,"If his return shall see with wreak inclos’d,"
400,1,440,"These in his house, or he return no more;"
400,1,441,And therefore I advise thee to explore
400,1,442,"All ways thyself, to set these wooers gone;"
400,1,443,To which end give me fit attentión:
400,1,444,To - morrow into solemn council call
400,1,445,"The Greek heroës, and declare to all"
400,1,446,(The Gods being witness) what thy pleasure is.
400,1,447,Command to towns of their nativity
400,1,448,These frontless wooers. If thy mother’s mind
400,1,449,"Stands to her second nuptials so inclin’d,"
400,1,450,"Return she to her royal father’s tow’rs,"
400,1,451,"Where th’ one of these may wed her, and her dow’rs"
400,1,452,"Make rich, and such as may consort with grace"
400,1,453,So dear a daughter of so great a race
400,1,454,And thee I warn as well (if thou as well
400,1,455,"Wilt hear and follow) take thy best - built sail,"
400,1,456,"With twenty oars mann’d, and haste t’ inquire"
400,1,457,"Where the abode is of thy absent sire,"
400,1,458,"If any can inform thee, or thine ear"
400,1,459,"From Jove the fame of his retreat may hear,"
400,1,460,For chiefly Jove gives all that honours men.
400,1,461,"To Pylos first be thy addression then,"
400,1,462,"To god - like Nestor; thence to Sparta haste,"
400,1,463,"To gold - lock’d Menelaus, who was last"
400,1,464,Of all the brass - arm’d Greeks that sail’d from Troy;
400,1,465,"And try from both these, if thou canst enjoy"
400,1,466,"News of thy sire’s return’d life anywhere,"
400,1,467,Though sad thou suffer’st in his search a year.
400,1,468,"If of his death thou hear’st, return thou home,"
400,1,469,"And to his memory erect a tomb,"
400,1,470,"Performing parent - rites, of feast and game,"
400,1,471,"Pompous, and such as best may fit his fame;"
400,1,472,And then thy mother a fit husband give.
400,1,473,"These past, consider how thou mayst deprive"
400,1,474,"Of worthless life these wooers in thy house,"
400,1,475,"By open force, or projects enginous."
400,1,476,Things childish fit not thee; th’ art so no more.
400,1,477,"Hast thou not heard, how all men did adore"
400,1,478,"Divine Orestes, after he had slain"
400,1,479,Ægisthus murd’ring by a treach’rous train
400,1,480,"His famous father? Be then, my most lov’d,"
400,1,481,"Valiant and manly, ev’ry way approv’d"
400,1,482,"As great as he. I see thy person fit,"
400,1,483,"Noble thy mind, and excellent thy wit,"
400,1,484,All giv’n thee so to use and manage here
400,1,485,That ev’n past death they may their memories bear.
400,1,486,"In meantime I’ll descend to ship and men,"
400,1,487,That much expect me. Be observant then
400,1,488,"Of my advice, and careful to maintain"
400,1,489,In equal acts thy royal father’s reign.”
400,1,490,"Telemachus replied: “You ope, fair guest,"
400,1,491,"A friend’s heart in your speech, as well exprest"
400,1,492,As might a father serve t’ inform his son;
400,1,493,All which sure place have in my memory won.
400,1,494,"Abide yet, though your voyage calls away,"
400,1,495,"That, having bath’d, and dignified your stay"
400,1,496,"With some more honour, you may yet beside"
400,1,497,Delight your mind by being gratified
400,1,498,"With some rich present taken in your way,"
400,1,499,"That, as a jewel, your respect may lay"
400,1,500,"Up in your treasury, bestow’d by me,"
400,1,501,As free friends use to guests of such degree.”
400,1,502,"“Detain me not,” said she, “so much inclin’d"
400,1,503,To haste my voyage. What thy loved mind
400,1,504,"Commands to give, at my return this way,"
400,1,505,"Bestow on me, that I directly may"
400,1,506,Convey it home; which more of price to me
400,1,507,The more it asks my recompense to thee.”
400,1,508,"This said, away grey - eyed Minerva flew,"
400,1,509,Like to a mounting lark; and did endue
400,1,510,"His mind with strength and boldness, and much more"
400,1,511,Made him his father long for than before;
400,1,512,"And weighing better who his guest might be,"
400,1,513,"He stood amaz’d, and thought a Deity"
400,1,514,Was there descended; to whose will he fram’d
400,1,515,"His pow’rs at all parts, and went so inflam’d"
400,1,516,"Amongst the wooers, who were silent set,"
400,1,517,To hear a poet sing the sad retreat
400,1,518,The Greeks perform’d from Troy; which was from thence
400,1,519,"Proclaim’d by Pallas, pain of her offence."
400,1,520,When which divine song was perceiv’d to bear
400,1,521,That mournful subject by the list’ning ear
400,1,522,"Of wise Penelope, Icarius’ seed,"
400,1,523,"Who from an upper room had giv’n it heed,"
400,1,524,"Down she descended by a winding stair,"
400,1,525,"Not solely, but the state in her repair"
400,1,526,Two maids of honour made. And when this queen
400,1,527,"Of women stoop’d so low, she might be seen"
400,1,528,"By all her wooers. In the door, aloof,"
400,1,529,"Ent’ring the hall grac’d with a goodly roof,"
400,1,530,"She stood, in shade of graceful veils, implied"
400,1,531,"About her beauties; on her either side,"
400,1,532,"Her honour’d women. When, to tears mov’d, thus"
400,1,533,"She chid the sacred singer: “Phemiüs,"
400,1,534,You know a number more of these great deeds
400,1,535,"Of Gods and men, that are the sacred seeds,"
400,1,536,"And proper subjects, of a poet’s song,"
400,1,537,"And those due pleasures that to men belong,"
400,1,538,"Besides these facts that furnish Troy’s retreat,"
400,1,539,"Sing one of those to these, that round your seat"
400,1,540,"They may with silence sit, and taste their wine;"
400,1,541,"But cease this song, that through these ears of mine"
400,1,542,Conveys deserv’d occasion to my heart
400,1,543,"Of endless sorrows, of which the desert"
400,1,544,"In me unmeasur’d is past all these men,"
400,1,545,"So endless is the memory I retain,"
400,1,546,"And so desertful is that memory,"
400,1,547,Of such a man as hath a dignity
400,1,548,So broad it spreads itself through all the pride
400,1,549,Of Greece and Argos.” To the queen replied
400,1,550,Inspir’d Telemachus: “Why thus envies
400,1,551,My mother him that fits societies[9]
400,1,552,"With so much harmony, to let him please"
400,1,553,His own mind in his will to honour these?
400,1,554,"For these ingenious and first sort of men,[10]"
400,1,555,That do immediately from Jove retain
400,1,556,"Their singing raptures, are by Jove as well"
400,1,557,"Inspir’d with choice of what their songs impell,"
400,1,558,"Jove’s will is free in it, and therefore theirs."
400,1,559,"Nor is this man to blame, that the repairs"
400,1,560,The Greeks make homeward sings; for his fresh muse
400,1,561,Men still most celebrate that sings most news.
400,1,562,And therefore in his note your ears employ:
400,1,563,For not Ulysses only lost in Troy
400,1,564,"The day of his return, but numbers more"
400,1,565,The deadly ruins of his fortunes bore.
400,1,566,"Go you then in, and take your work in hand,"
400,1,567,"Your web, and distaff; and your maids command"
400,1,568,"To ply their fit work. Words to men are due,"
400,1,569,"And those reproving counsels you pursue,"
400,1,570,"And most to me of all men, since I bear"
400,1,571,The rule of all things that are manag’d here.”
400,1,572,"She went amaz’d away, and in her heart"
400,1,573,Laid up the wisdom Pallas did impart
400,1,574,"To her lov’d son so lately, turn’d again"
400,1,575,"Up to her chamber, and no more would reign"
400,1,576,In manly counsels. To her women she
400,1,577,Applied her sway; and to the wooers he
400,1,578,"Began new orders, other spirits bewray’d"
400,1,579,Than those in spite of which the wooers sway’d.
400,1,580,"And (whiles his mother’s tears still wash’d her eyes,"
400,1,581,Till grey Minerva did those tears surprise
400,1,582,"With timely sleep, and that her wooers did rouse"
400,1,583,"Rude tumult up through all the shady house,"
400,1,584,Dispos’d to sleep because their widow was)
400,1,585,Telemachus this new - giv’n spirit did pass
400,1,586,"On their old insolence: “Ho! you that are,"
400,1,587,My mother’s wooers! much too high ye bear
400,1,588,"Your petulant spirits; sit; and, while ye may"
400,1,589,"Enjoy me in your banquets, see ye lay"
400,1,590,"These loud notes down, nor do this man the wrong,"
400,1,591,"Because my mother hath disliked his song,"
400,1,592,To grace her interruption. ’Tis a thing
400,1,593,"Honest, and honour’d too, to hear one sing"
400,1,594,"Numbers so like the Gods in elegance,"
400,1,595,"As this man flows in. By the morn’s first light,[11]"
400,1,596,"I’ll call ye all before me in a Court,"
400,1,597,"That I may clearly banish your resort,"
400,1,598,"With all your rudeness, from these roofs of mine."
400,1,599,Away; and elsewhere in your feasts combine.
400,1,600,"Consume your own goods, and make mutual feast"
400,1,601,"At either’s house. Or if ye still hold best,"
400,1,602,"And for your humours’ more sufficéd fill,"
400,1,603,"To feed, to spoil, because unpunish’d still,"
400,1,604,"On other findings, spoil; but here I call"
400,1,605,"Th’ Eternal Gods to witness, if it fall"
400,1,606,"In my wish’d reach once to be dealing wreaks,"
400,1,607,"By Jove’s high bounty, these your present checks"
400,1,608,To what I give in charge shall add more reins
400,1,609,To my revenge hereafter; and the pains
400,1,610,Ye then must suffer shall pass all your pride
400,1,611,"Ever to see redress’d, or qualified.”"
400,1,612,"At this all bit their lips, and did admire"
400,1,613,His words sent from him with such phrase and fire;
400,1,614,"Which so much mov’d them that Antinous,"
400,1,615,"Eupitheus’ son, cried out: “Telemachus!"
400,1,616,"The Gods, I think, have rapt thee to this height"
400,1,617,"Of elocution, and this great conceit"
400,1,618,"Of self - ability. We all may pray,"
400,1,619,That Jove invest not in this kingdom’s sway
400,1,620,"Thy forward forces, which I see put forth"
400,1,621,A hot ambition in thee for thy birth.”
400,1,622,"“Be not offended,” he replied, “if I[12]"
400,1,623,"Shall say, I would assume this empery,"
400,1,624,If Jove gave leave. You are not he that sings:
400,1,625,_The rule of kingdoms is the worst of things._
400,1,626,"Nor is it ill, at all, to sway a throne;"
400,1,627,A man may quickly gain possession
400,1,628,"Of mighty riches, make a wondrous prize"
400,1,629,Set of his virtues; but the dignities
400,1,630,"That deck a king, there are enough beside"
400,1,631,In this circumfluous isle that want no pride
400,1,632,"To think them worthy of, as young as I,"
400,1,633,And old as you are. An ascent so high
400,1,634,My thoughts affect not. Dead is he that held
400,1,635,Desert of virtue to have so excell’d.
400,1,636,But of these turrets I will take on me
400,1,637,"To be the absolute king, and reign as free,"
400,1,638,"As did my father, over all his hand"
400,1,639,Left here in this house slaves to my command.”
400,1,640,"Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,"
400,1,641,To this made this reply: “Telemachus!
400,1,642,The girlond of this kingdom let the knees
400,1,643,Of Deity run for; but the faculties
400,1,644,"This house is seis’d of, and the turrets here,"
400,1,645,"Thou shalt be lord of, nor shall any bear"
400,1,646,"The least part off of all thou dost possess,"
400,1,647,As long as this land is no wilderness.
400,1,648,"Nor rul’d by out - laws. But give these their pass,"
400,1,649,"And tell me, best of princes, who he was"
400,1,650,That guested here so late? From whence? And what
400,1,651,In any region boasted he his state?
400,1,652,His race? His country? Brought he any news
400,1,653,Of thy returning father? Or for dues
400,1,654,Of moneys to him made he fit repair?
400,1,655,"How suddenly he rush’d into the air,"
400,1,656,Nor would sustain to stay and make him known!
400,1,657,His port show’d no debauch’d companion.”
400,1,658,He answer’d: “The return of my lov’d sire
400,1,659,Is past all hope; and should rude Fame inspire
400,1,660,From any place a flatt’ring messenger
400,1,661,"With news of his survival, he should bear"
400,1,662,No least belief off from my desp’rate love.
400,1,663,"Which if a sacred prophet should approve,"
400,1,664,"Call’d by my mother for her care’s unrest,"
400,1,665,"It should not move me. For my late fair guest,"
400,1,666,"He was of old my father’s, touching here"
400,1,667,From sea - girt Taphos; and for name doth bear
400,1,668,"Mentas, the son of wise Anchialus;"
400,1,669,And governs all the Taphians studious
400,1,670,"Of navigation.” This he said, but knew"
400,1,671,It was a Goddess. These again withdrew
400,1,672,To dances and attraction of the song;
400,1,673,"And while their pleasures did the time prolong,"
400,1,674,"The sable Even descended, and did steep"
400,1,675,The lids of all men in desire of sleep.
400,1,676,"Telemachus, into a room built high,"
400,1,677,"Of his illustrious court, and to the eye"
400,1,678,"Of circular prospect, to his bed ascended,"
400,1,679,And in his mind much weighty thought contended
400,1,680,Before him Euryclea (that well knew
400,1,681,"All the observance of a handmaid’s due,"
400,1,682,Daughter to Opis Pisenorides)
400,1,683,Bore two bright torches; who did so much please
400,1,684,"Laërtes in her prime, that, for the price"
400,1,685,"Of twenty oxen, he made merchandise"
400,1,686,"Of her rare beauties; and love’s equal flame,"
400,1,687,"To her he felt, as to his nuptial dame,"
400,1,688,"Yet never durst he mix with her in bed,"
400,1,689,So much the anger of his wife he fled.
400,1,690,"She, now grown old, to young Telemachus"
400,1,691,"Two torches bore, and was obsequious"
400,1,692,"Past all his other maids, and did apply"
400,1,693,Her service to him from his infancy.
400,1,694,"His well - built chamber reach’d, she op’d the door,"
400,1,695,"He on his bed sat, the soft weeds he wore"
400,1,696,"Put off, and to the diligent old maid"
400,1,697,"Gave all; who fitly all in thick folds laid,"
400,1,698,"And hung them on a beam - pin near the bed,"
400,1,699,That round about was rich embroidered.
400,1,700,"Then made she haste forth from him, and did bring"
400,1,701,"The door together with a silver ring,"
400,1,702,And by a string a bar to it did pull.
400,1,703,"He, laid, and cover’d well with curled wool"
400,1,704,"Wov’n in silk quilts, all night employ’d his mind"
400,1,705,About the task that Pallas had design’d.
400,1,706,FINIS LIBRI PRIMI HOM. ODYSS.
400,1,707,[1] The information or fashion of an absolute man; and necessary (or
400,1,708,fatal) passage through many afflictions (according with the most
400,1,709,"Sacred Letter) to his natural haven and country, is the whole argument"
400,1,710,and scope of this inimitable and miraculous poem. And therefore is the
400,1,711,epithet _πολὐτροπον_ given him in the first verse: _πολὐτροπος_
400,1,712,"signifying, _Homo cujus ingenium velut per multas et varias vias"
400,1,713,vertitur in verum._
400,1,714,[2] These notes following I am forced to insert (since the words they
400,1,715,contain differ from all other translations) lest I be thought to err
400,1,716,out of that ignorance that may perhaps possess my depraver.
400,1,717,"[3] _‘Αμὑμονος_ translated in this place _inculpabilis,_ and made the"
400,1,718,"epithet of Ægisthus, is from the true sense of the word, as it is here"
400,1,719,to be understood; which is quite contrary. As _ὰντίθεος_ is to be
400,1,720,"expounded in some place _Divinus,_ or _Deo similis,_ but in another"
400,1,721,(soon after) _contrarius Deo._ The person to whom the epithet is given
400,1,722,"giving reason to distinguish it. And so _ὀλοὁφρων,_ an epithet given"
400,1,723,"to Atlas, instantly following, in one place signifies _mente"
400,1,724,"perniciosus,_ in the next, _qui universa mente gerit._"
400,1,725,"[4] In this place is Atlas given the epithet _ὀλοὁφρων,_ which"
400,1,726,"signifies _qui universa mente agitat,_ here given him for the power"
400,1,727,the stars have in all things. Yet this receives other interpretation
400,1,728,"in other places, as abovesaid."
400,1,729,"[5] _Δὐστηνος_ is here turned by others, _infelix,_ in the general"
400,1,730,"collection; when it hath here a particular exposition, applied to"

400,1,732,locum invenire potest ubi consistat._
400,1,733,"[6] This is thus translated, the rather to express and approve the"
400,1,734,allegory driven through the whole Odysseys. Deciphering the intangling
400,1,735,of the wisest in his affections; and the torments that breed in every
400,1,736,pious mind; to be thereby hindered to arrive so directly as he
400,1,737,"desires, at the proper and only true natural country of every worthy"
400,1,738,"man, whose haven is heaven and the next life, to which, this life is"
400,1,739,but a sea in continual æsture and vexation. The words occasioning all
400,1,740,"this are _μαλακοἳς λὀλοις: μαλακὀς_ signifying, _qui languide, et"
400,1,741,animo remisso rem aliquam gerit;_ which being the effect of Calypso’s
400,1,742,"sweet words in Ulysses, is here applied passively to his own"
400,1,743,sufferance of their operation.
400,1,744,"[7] _῞Ερκος ὀδὀντων,_ viz. _vallum_ or _clanstrum dentium,_ which, for"
400,1,745,"the better sound in our language, is here turned, Pale of Ivory. The"
400,1,746,"teeth being that rampire, or pale, given us by nature in that part for"
400,1,747,"restraint and compression of our speech, till the imagination,"
400,1,748,"appetite, and soul (that ought to rule in their examination, before"
400,1,749,their delivery) have given worthy pass to them. The most grave and
400,1,750,"divine poet, teaching therein, that not so much for the necessary"
400,1,751,"chewing of our sustenance our teeth are given us, as for their stay of"
400,1,752,"our words, lest we utter them rashly."
400,1,753,"[8] _Τὀσος παîς, Tantus filius._ Pallas thus enforcing her question to"
400,1,754,stir up the son the more to the father’s worthiness.
400,1,755,"[9] _’Ερἰηρος ἀοιδὀς. Cantor, cujus tam apta est societas hominibus._"
400,1,756,[10] _’Ανδρἀσιν ἀλφηστᾔσιν. ’Αλφηστᾔσιν_ is an epithet proper to poets
400,1,757,for their first finding out of arts and documents tending to elocution
400,1,758,"and government inspired only by Jove, and are here called the first of"
400,1,759,"men, since first they gave rules to manly life, and have their"
400,1,760,information immediately from Jove (as Plato in Ione witnesseth); the
400,1,761,"word deduced from _ἅλφα,_ which is taken for him _qui primas teneat"
400,1,762,"aliquâ in re,_ and will _ἀλφηστῃσιν_ then be sufficiently expressed"
400,1,763,"with _ingeniosis,_ than which no exposition goes further."
400,1,764,"[11] _’Ηωθεν, prima luce._"
400,1,765,"[12] Upon this answer of Telemachus, because it hath so sudden a"
400,1,766,"change and is so far let down from his late height of heat, altering"
400,1,767,and tempering so commandingly his affections I thought not amiss to
400,1,768,"insert here Spondanus’ further annotations, which is this: _Prudenter"
400,1,769,Telemachus joco furorem Antinoi ac asperitatem emolliit. Nam ita
400,1,770,"dictum illius interpretatur, ut existimetur censere jocosè ilia etiam"
400,1,771,ab Antinoo adversum se pronunciata. Et primum ironicè se Regem esse
400,1,772,exoptat propter commoda quæ Reges solent comitari. Ne tamen invidiam
400,1,773,"in se ambitionis concitet, testatur se regnum, Ithacæ non ambire,"
400,1,774,"mortuo Ulysse, cum id alii possidere queant se longe præstantiores ac"
400,1,775,"digniores: hoc unum ait se moliri, ut propriarum ædium et bonorum"

400,1,777,disperdere conantur._
400,2,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,2,2,Telemachus to court doth call
400,2,3,"The Wooers, and commands them all"
400,2,4,To leave his house; and taking then
400,2,5,"From wise Minerva ship and men,"
400,2,6,"And all things fit for him beside,"
400,2,7,That Euryclea could provide
400,2,8,"For sea - rites till he found his sire,"
400,2,9,He hoists sail; when Heav’n stoops his fire.
400,2,10,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,2,11,_βητα._
400,2,12,The old Maid’s store
400,2,13,The voyage cheers.
400,2,14,"The ship leaves shore,"
400,2,15,Minerva steers.
400,2,16,"Now when with rosy fingers, th’ early born"
400,2,17,"And thrown through all the air, appear’d the Morn,"
400,2,18,"Ulysses’ lov’d son from his bed appear’d,"
400,2,19,"His weeds put on, and did about him gird"
400,2,20,"His sword that thwart his shoulders hung, and tied"
400,2,21,"To his fair feet fair shoes, and all parts plied"
400,2,22,"For speedy readiness: who, when he trod"
400,2,23,"The open earth, to men show’d like a God."
400,2,24,The heralds then he straight charg’d to consort
400,2,25,"The curl’d - head Greeks, with loud calls, to a Court."
400,2,26,They summon’d; th’ other came in utmost haste.
400,2,27,"Who all assembled, and in one heap plac’d"
400,2,28,"He likewise came to council, and did bear"
400,2,29,In his fair hand his iron - headed spear.
400,2,30,"Nor came alone, nor with men - troops prepar’d,"
400,2,31,But two fleet dogs made both his train and guard.
400,2,32,"Pallas supplied with her high wisdom’s grace,"
400,2,33,"That all men’s wants supplies, State’s painted face."
400,2,34,His ent’ring presence all men did admire;
400,2,35,"Who took seat in the high throne of his sire,"
400,2,36,To which the grave peers gave him rev’rend way.
400,2,37,"Amongst whom, an Egyptian heroë"
400,2,38,"(Crookéd with age, and full of skill) begun"
400,2,39,The speech to all; who had a loved son
400,2,40,That with divine Ulysses did ascend
400,2,41,"His hollow fleet to Troy; to serve which end,"
400,2,42,"He kept fair horse, and was a man - at - arms,"
400,2,43,And in the cruel Cyclop’s stern alarms
400,2,44,"His life lost by him in his hollow cave,"
400,2,45,"Whose entrails open’d his abhorréd grave,"
400,2,46,"And made of him, of all Ulysses’ train,"
400,2,47,"His latest supper, being latest slain;"
400,2,48,"His name was Antiphus, And this old man,"
400,2,49,"This crookéd - grown, this wise Egyptian,"
400,2,50,Had three sons more; of which one riotous
400,2,51,"A wooer was, and call’d Eurynomus;"
400,2,52,The other two took both his own wish’d course.
400,2,53,"Yet both the best fates weigh’d not down the worse,"
400,2,54,But left the old man mindful still of moan;
400,2,55,"Who, weeping, thus bespake the Session:"
400,2,56,"“Hear, Ithacensians, all I fitly say:"
400,2,57,Since our divine Ulysses’ parting day
400,2,58,"Never was council call’d, nor session,"
400,2,59,And now by whom is this thus undergone?
400,2,60,"Whom did necessity so much compell,"
400,2,61,Of young or old? Hath anyone heard tell
400,2,62,"Of any coming army, that he thus now"
400,2,63,"May openly take boldness to avow,"
400,2,64,First having heard it? Or will any here
400,2,65,Some motion for the public good prefer?
400,2,66,Some worth of note there is in this command;
400,2,67,"And, methinks, it must be some good man’s hand"
400,2,68,"That’s put to it, that either hath direct"
400,2,69,"Means to assist, or, for his good affect,"
400,2,70,Hopes to be happy in the proof he makes;
400,2,71,"And that Jove grant, whate’er he undertakes.”"
400,2,72,Telemachus (rejoicing much to hear
400,2,73,The good hope and opinion men did bear
400,2,74,"Of his young actions) no longer sat,"
400,2,75,"But long’d t’ approve what this man pointed at,"
400,2,76,And make his first proof in a cause so good;
400,2,77,And in the council’s chief place up he stood;
400,2,78,"When straight Pisenor (herald to his sire,"
400,2,79,And learn’d in counsels) felt his heart on fire
400,2,80,"To hear him speak, and put into his hand"
400,2,81,The sceptre that his father did command;
400,2,82,"Then, to the old Egyptian turn’d, he spoke:"
400,2,83,"“Father, not far he is that undertook"
400,2,84,To call this Council; whom you soon shall know.
400,2,85,"Myself, whose wrongs my griefs will make me show,"
400,2,86,Am he that author’d this assembly here.
400,2,87,"Nor have I heard of any army near,"
400,2,88,"Of which, being first told, I might iterate,"
400,2,89,"Nor for the public good can aught relate,"
400,2,90,"Only mine own affairs all this procure,"
400,2,91,That in my house a double ill endure;
400,2,92,"One, having lost a father so renown’d,"
400,2,93,Whose kind rule once with’ your command was crown’d;
400,2,94,"The other is, what much more doth augment"
400,2,95,"His weighty loss, the ruin imminent"
400,2,96,"Of all my house by it, my goods all spent."
400,2,97,"And of all this the wooers, that are sons"
400,2,98,"To our chief peers, are the confusións,"
400,2,99,Importuning my mother’s marriáge
400,2,100,Against her will; nor dares their blood’s bold rage
400,2,101,"Go to Icarius’, her father’s, court,"
400,2,102,"That, his will ask’d in kind and comely sort,"
400,2,103,"He may endow his daughter with a dow’r,"
400,2,104,"And, she consenting, at his pleasure’s pow’r"
400,2,105,"Dispose her to a man, that, thus behav’d,"
400,2,106,"May have fit grace, and see her honour sav’d."
400,2,107,"But these, in none but my house, all their lives"
400,2,108,"Resolve to spend; slaught’ring my sheep and beeves,"
400,2,109,"And with my fattest goats lay feast on feast,"
400,2,110,My gen’rous wine consuming as they list.
400,2,111,"A world of things they spoil, here wanting one,"
400,2,112,"That, like Ulysses, quickly could set gone"
400,2,113,"These peace - plagues from his house, that spoil like war;"
400,2,114,"Whom my pow’rs are unfit to urge so far,"
400,2,115,"Myself immartial. But, had I the pow’r,"
400,2,116,My will should serve me to exempt this hour
400,2,117,"From out my life - time. For, past patience,"
400,2,118,"Base deeds are done here, that exceed defence"
400,2,119,"Of any honour. Falling is my house,"
400,2,120,Which you should shame to see so ruinous.
400,2,121,"Rev’rence the censures that all good men give,"
400,2,122,That dwell about you; and for fear to live
400,2,123,Expos’d to heav’n’s wrath (that doth ever pay
400,2,124,"Pains for joys forfeit) even by Jove I pray,"
400,2,125,"Or Themis, both which pow’rs have to restrain,"
400,2,126,"Or gather, councils, that ye will abstain"
400,2,127,"From further spoil, and let me only waste"
400,2,128,In that most wretched grief I have embrac’d
400,2,129,For my lost father. And though I am free
400,2,130,"From meriting your outrage, yet, if he,"
400,2,131,"Good man, hath ever with a hostile heart"
400,2,132,"Done ill to any Greek, on me convert"
400,2,133,"Your like hostility, and vengeance take"
400,2,134,"Of his ill on my life, and all these make"
400,2,135,"Join in that justice; but, to see abus’d"
400,2,136,"Those goods that do none ill but being ill - us’d,"
400,2,137,"Exceeds all right. Yet better ’tis for me,"
400,2,138,My whole possessions and my rents to see
400,2,139,"Consum’d by you, than lose my life and all;"
400,2,140,"For on your rapine a revenge may fall,"
400,2,141,While I live; and so long I may complain
400,2,142,"About the city, till my goods again,"
400,2,143,"Oft ask’d, may be with all amends repaid."
400,2,144,But in the mean space your misrule hath laid
400,2,145,"Griefs on my bosom, that can only speak,"
400,2,146,And are denied the instant pow’r of wreak.”
400,2,147,"This said, his sceptre ’gainst the ground he threw,"
400,2,148,"And tears still’d from him; which mov’d all the crew,"
400,2,149,"The court struck silent, not a man did dare"
400,2,150,To give a word that might offend his ear.
400,2,151,Antinous only in this sort replied:
400,2,152,"“High spoken, and of spirit unpacified,"
400,2,153,How have you sham’d us in this speech of yours!
400,2,154,Will you brand us for an offence not ours?
400,2,155,"Your mother, first in craft, is first in cause."
400,2,156,"Three years are past, and near the fourth now draws,"
400,2,157,Since first she mock’d the peers Achaian.
400,2,158,"All she made hope, and promis’d ev’ry man,"
400,2,159,"Sent for us ever, left love’s show in nought,"
400,2,160,But in her heart conceal’d another thought.
400,2,161,"Besides, as curious in her craft, her loom"
400,2,162,"She with a web charg’d, hard to overcome,"
400,2,163,"And thus bespake us: ‘Youths, that seek my bed,"
400,2,164,"Since my divine spouse rests amongst the dead,"
400,2,165,"Hold on your suits but till I end, at most,"
400,2,166,"This funeral weed, lest what is done be lost."
400,2,167,"Besides, I purpose, that when th’ austere fate"
400,2,168,Of bitter death shall take into his state
400,2,169,"Laertes the heroë, it shall deck"
400,2,170,"His royal corse, since I should suffer check"
400,2,171,"In ill report of ev’ry common dame,"
400,2,172,If one so rich should show in death his shame.’
400,2,173,This speech she us’d; and this did soon persuade
400,2,174,Our gentle minds. But this a work she made
400,2,175,"So hugely long, undoing still in night,"
400,2,176,"By torches, all she did by day’s broad light,"
400,2,177,"That three years her deceit div’d past our view,"
400,2,178,And made us think that all she feign’d was true.
400,2,179,"But when the fourth year came, and those sly hours"
400,2,180,"That still surprise at length dames’ craftiest powers,"
400,2,181,"One of her women, that knew all, disclos’d"
400,2,182,"The secret to us, that she still unloos’d"
400,2,183,Her whole day’s fair affair in depth of night.
400,2,184,"And then no further she could force her sleight,"
400,2,185,"But, of necessity, her work gave end."
400,2,186,"And thus, by me, doth ev’ry other friend,"
400,2,187,"Professing love to her, reply to thee;"
400,2,188,"That ev’n thyself, and all Greeks else, may see,"
400,2,189,"That we offend not in our stay, but she."
400,2,190,"To free thy house then, send her to her sire,"
400,2,191,Commanding that her choice be left entire
400,2,192,"To his election, and one settled will."
400,2,193,Nor let her vex with her illusions still
400,2,194,"Her friends that woo her, standing on her wit,"
400,2,195,Because wise Pallas hath giv’n wills to it
400,2,196,"So full of art, and made her understand"
400,2,197,All works in fair skill of a lady’s hand.
400,2,198,But (for her working mind) we read of none
400,2,199,"Of all the old world, in which Greece hath shown"
400,2,200,"Her rarest pieces, that could equal her:"
400,2,201,"Tyro, Alcmena, and Mycena were"
400,2,202,"To hold comparison in no degree,"
400,2,203,"For solid brain, with wise Penelope."
400,2,204,"And yet, in her delays of us, she shows"
400,2,205,No prophet’s skill with all the wit she owes;
400,2,206,For all this time thy goods and victuals go
400,2,207,"To utter ruin; and shall ever so,"
400,2,208,While thus the Gods her glorious mind dispose.
400,2,209,"Glory herself may gain, but thou shalt lose"
400,2,210,"Thy longings ev’n for necessary food,"
400,2,211,"For we will never go where lies our good,"
400,2,212,"Nor any other where, till this delay"
400,2,213,She puts on all she quits with th’ endless stay
400,2,214,"Of some one of us, that to all the rest"
400,2,215,May give free farewell with his nuptial feast.”
400,2,216,The wise young prince replied: “Antinous!
400,2,217,I may by no means turn out of my house
400,2,218,Her that hath brought me forth and nourish’d me.
400,2,219,"Besides, if quick or dead my father be"
400,2,220,"In any region, yet abides in doubt;"
400,2,221,"And ’twill go hard, my means being so run out,"
400,2,222,"To tender to Icarius again,"
400,2,223,If he again my mother must maintain
400,2,224,"In her retreat, the dow’r she brought with her."
400,2,225,"And then a double ill it will confer,"
400,2,226,"Both from my father and from God on me,"
400,2,227,"When, thrust out of her house, on her bent knee,"
400,2,228,My mother shall the horrid Furies raise
400,2,229,"With imprecations, and all men dispraise"
400,2,230,My part in her exposure. Never then
400,2,231,Will I perform this counsel. If your spleen
400,2,232,"Swell at my courses, once more I command"
400,2,233,Your absence from my house; some other’s hand
400,2,234,"Charge with your banquets; on your own goods eat,"
400,2,235,"And either other mutually in treat,"
400,2,236,"At either of your houses, with your feast."
400,2,237,But if ye still esteem more sweet and best
400,2,238,"Another’s spoil, so you still wreakless live,"
400,2,239,"Gnaw, vermin - like, things sacred, no laws give[1]"
400,2,240,To your devouring; it remains that I
400,2,241,"Invoke each Ever - living Deity,"
400,2,242,"And vow, if Jove shall deign in any date"
400,2,243,"Pow’r of like pains for pleasure so past rate,"
400,2,244,"From thenceforth look, where ye have revell’d so"
400,2,245,"Unwreak’d, your ruins all shall undergo.”"
400,2,246,"Thus spake Telemachus; t’ assure whose threat,"
400,2,247,Far - seeing Jove upon their pinions set
400,2,248,"Two eagles from the high brows of a hill,"
400,2,249,"That, mounted on the Winds, together still"
400,2,250,Their strokes extended; but arriving now
400,2,251,"Amidst the Council, over ev’ry brow"
400,2,252,"Shook their thick wings and, threat’ning death’s cold fears,"
400,2,253,Their necks and cheeks tore with their eager seres;
400,2,254,"Then, on the court’s right hand away they flew,"
400,2,255,"Above both court and city. With whose view,"
400,2,256,And study what events they might foretell
400,2,257,The Council into admiration fell.
400,2,258,"The old heroë, Halitherses, then,"
400,2,259,"The son of Nestor, that of all old men,"
400,2,260,"His peers in that court, only could foresee"
400,2,261,"By flight of fowls man’s fixed destiny,"
400,2,262,"’Twixt them and their amaze, this interpos’d:"
400,2,263,"“Hear, Ithacensians, all your doubts disclos’d."
400,2,264,"The Wooers most are touch’d in this ostent,"
400,2,265,To whom are dangers great and imminent;
400,2,266,For now not long more shall Ulysses bear
400,2,267,"Lack of his most lov’d, but fills some place near,"
400,2,268,Addressing to these Wooers fate and death.
400,2,269,And many more this mischief menaceth
400,2,270,Of us inhabiting this famous isle.
400,2,271,"Let us consult yet, in this long forewhile,"
400,2,272,How to ourselves we may prevent this ill.
400,2,273,"Let these men rest secure, and revel still;"
400,2,274,"Though they might find it safer, if with us"
400,2,275,They would in time prevent what threats them thus;
400,2,276,Since not without sure trial I foretell
400,2,277,"These coming storms, but know their issue well."
400,2,278,"For to Ulysses all things have event,"
400,2,279,"As I foretold him, when for Ilion went"
400,2,280,"The whole Greek fleet together, and with them"
400,2,281,Th’ abundant - in - all - counsels took the stream.
400,2,282,"I told him, that, when much ill he had past,"
400,2,283,"And all his men were lost, he should at last,"
400,2,284,"The twentieth year, turn home, to all unknown;"
400,2,285,All which effects are to perfection grown.”
400,2,286,"Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,"
400,2,287,"Oppos’d this man’s presage, and answer’d thus:"
400,2,288,"“Hence, great in years, go, prophesy at home,"
400,2,289,Thy children teach to shun their ills to come.
400,2,290,In these superior far to thee am I.
400,2,291,A world of fowls beneath the sun - beams fly
400,2,292,That are not fit t’ inform a prophecy.
400,2,293,"Besides, Ulysses perish’d long ago;"
400,2,294,"And would thy fates to thee had destin’d so,"
400,2,295,Since so thy so much prophecy had spar’d
400,2,296,"Thy wronging of our rights, which, for reward"
400,2,297,"Expected home with thee, hath summon’d us"
400,2,298,Within the anger of Telemachus.
400,2,299,"But this I will presage, which shall be true:"
400,2,300,If any spark of anger chance t’ ensue
400,2,301,"Thy much old art in these deep auguries,"
400,2,302,"In this young man incenséd by thy lies,"
400,2,303,Ev’n to himself his anger shall confer
400,2,304,"The greater anguish, and thine own ends err"
400,2,305,"From all their objects; and, besides, thine age"
400,2,306,"Shall feel a pain, to make thee curse presage"
400,2,307,"With worthy cause, for it shall touch thee near."
400,2,308,"But I will soon give end to all our fear,"
400,2,309,"Preventing whatsoever chance can fall,"
400,2,310,"In my suit to the young prince for us all,"
400,2,311,"To send his mother to her father’s house,"
400,2,312,"That he may sort her out a worthy spouse,"
400,2,313,"And such a dow’r bestow, as may befit"
400,2,314,"One lov’d, to leave her friends and follow it."
400,2,315,"Before which course be, I believe that none"
400,2,316,Of all the Greeks will cease th’ ambitión
400,2,317,"Of such a match. For, chance what can to us,"
400,2,318,"We no man fear, no not Telemachus,"
400,2,319,Though ne’er so greatly spoken. Nor care we
400,2,320,"For any threats of austere prophecy,"
400,2,321,"Which thou, old dotard, vaunt’st of so in vain."
400,2,322,And thus shalt thou in much more hate remain;
400,2,323,"For still the Gods shall bear their ill expense,"
400,2,324,"Nor ever be dispos’d by competence,"
400,2,325,"Till with her nuptials she dismiss our suits,"
400,2,326,Our whole lives’ days shall sow hopes for such fruits.
400,2,327,"Her virtues we contend to, nor will go"
400,2,328,"To any other, be she never so"
400,2,329,"Worthy of us, and all the worth we owe.”"
400,2,330,"He answer’d him: “Eurymachus, and all"
400,2,331,"Ye gen’rous Wooers, now, in general,"
400,2,332,"I see your brave resolves, and will no more"
400,2,333,"Make speech of these points, and, much less, implore."
400,2,334,"It is enough, that all the Grecians here,"
400,2,335,"And all the Gods besides, just witness bear,"
400,2,336,What friendly premonitions have been spent
400,2,337,"On your forbearance, and their vain event."
400,2,338,"Yet, with my other friends, let love prevail"
400,2,339,"To fit me with a vessel free of sail,"
400,2,340,"And twenty men, that may divide to me"
400,2,341,My ready passage through the yielding sea
400,2,342,"For Sparta, and Amathoan Pylos’ shore,"
400,2,343,"I now am bound, in purpose to explore"
400,2,344,"My long - lack’d father, and to try if fame"
400,2,345,"Or Jove, most author of man’s honour’d name,"
400,2,346,"With his return and life may glad mine ear,"
400,2,347,Though toil’d in that proof I sustain a year.
400,2,348,"If dead I hear him, nor of more state, here"
400,2,349,"Retir’d to my lov’d country, I will rear"
400,2,350,"A sepulchre to him, and celebrate"
400,2,351,"Such royal parent - rites, as fits his state;"
400,2,352,And then my mother to a spouse dispose.”
400,2,353,"This said, he sat; and to the rest arose"
400,2,354,"Mentor, that was Ulysses’ chosen friend,"
400,2,355,"To whom, when he set forth, he did commend"
400,2,356,"His cómplete family, and whom he will’d"
400,2,357,"To see the mind of his old sire fulfill’d,"
400,2,358,"All things conserving safe, till his retreat."
400,2,359,"Who, tender of his charge, and seeing so set"
400,2,360,"In slight care of their king his subjects there,"
400,2,361,"Suff’ring his son so much contempt to bear,"
400,2,362,"Thus gravely, and with zeal, to him began:"
400,2,363,"“No more let any sceptre - bearing man,"
400,2,364,"Benevolent, or mild, or human be,"
400,2,365,"Nor in his mind form acts of piety,"
400,2,366,"But ever feed on blood, and facts unjust"
400,2,367,"Commit, ev’n to the full swing of his lust,"
400,2,368,"Since of divine Ulysses no man now,"
400,2,369,"Of all his subjects, any thought doth show."
400,2,370,"All whom he govern’d, and became to them,"
400,2,371,"Rather than one that wore a diadem,"
400,2,372,"A most indulgent father. But, for all"
400,2,373,"That can touch me, within no envy fall"
400,2,374,"These insolent Wooers, that in violent kind"
400,2,375,"Commit things foul by th’ ill wit of the mind,"
400,2,376,And with the hazard of their heads devour
400,2,377,"Ulysses’ house, since his returning hour"
400,2,378,"They hold past hope. But it affects me much,"
400,2,379,"Ye dull plebeians, that all this doth touch"
400,2,380,"Your free states nothing; who, struck dumb, afford"
400,2,381,"These Wooers not so much wreak as a word,"
400,2,382,"Though few, and you with only number might"
400,2,383,Extinguish to them the profaned light.”
400,2,384,"Evenor’s son, Leocritus, replied:"
400,2,385,"“Mentor! the railer, made a fool with pride,"
400,2,386,What language giv’st thou that would quiet us
400,2,387,"With putting us in storm, exciting thus"
400,2,388,"The rout against us? Who, though more than we,"
400,2,389,Should find it is no easy victory
400,2,390,"To drive men, habited in feast, from feasts,"
400,2,391,No not if Ithacus himself such guests
400,2,392,"Should come and find so furnishing his Court,"
400,2,393,And hope to force them from so sweet a fort.
400,2,394,"His wife should little joy in his arrive,"
400,2,395,"Though much she wants him; for, where she alive"
400,2,396,"Would her’s enjoy, there death should claim his rights."
400,2,397,_He must be conquer’d that with many fights._
400,2,398,Thou speak’st unfit things. To their labours then
400,2,399,"Disperse these people; and let these two men,"
400,2,400,"Mentor and Halitherses, that so boast"
400,2,401,From the beginning to have govern’d most
400,2,402,"In friendship of the father, to the son"
400,2,403,Confirm the course he now affects to run.
400,2,404,"But my mind says, that, if he would but use"
400,2,405,"A little patience, he should here hear news"
400,2,406,"Of all things that his wish would understand,"
400,2,407,But no good hope for of the course in hand.”
400,2,408,"This said, the Council rose; when ev’ry peer"
400,2,409,And all the people in dispersion were
400,2,410,To houses of their own; the Wooers yet
400,2,411,Made to Ulysses’ house their old retreat.
400,2,412,"Telemachus, apart from all the prease,"
400,2,413,"Prepar’d to shore, and, in the aged seas"
400,2,414,"His fair hands wash’d, did thus to Pallas pray:"
400,2,415,"“Hear me, O Goddess, that but yesterday"
400,2,416,"Didst deign access to me at home, and lay"
400,2,417,"Grave charge on me to take ship, and inquire"
400,2,418,Along the dark seas for mine absent sire!
400,2,419,Which all the Greeks oppose; amongst whom most
400,2,420,"Those that are proud still at another’s cost,"
400,2,421,"Past measure, and the civil rights of men,"
400,2,422,"My mother’s Wooers, my repulse maintain.”"
400,2,423,Thus spake he praying; when close to him came
400,2,424,"Pallas, resembling Mentor both in frame"
400,2,425,"Of voice and person, and advis’d him thus:"
400,2,426,"“Those Wooers well might know, Telemachus,"
400,2,427,"Thou wilt not ever weak and childish be,"
400,2,428,If to thee be instill’d the faculty
400,2,429,Of mind and body that thy father grac’d;
400,2,430,"And if, like him, there be in thee enchac’d"
400,2,431,"Virtue to give words works, and works their end."
400,2,432,"This voyage, that to them thou didst commend,"
400,2,433,"Shall not so quickly, as they idly ween,"
400,2,434,"Be vain, or giv’n up, for their opposite spleen."
400,2,435,"But, if Ulysses nor Penelope"
400,2,436,"Were thy true parents, I then hope in thee"
400,2,437,Of no more urging thy attempt in hand;
400,2,438,"For few, that rightly bred on both sides stand,"
400,2,439,"Are like their parents, many that are worse,"
400,2,440,And most few better. Those then that the nurse
400,2,441,"Or mother call true - born yet are not so,"
400,2,442,Like worthy sires much less are like to grow.
400,2,443,But thou show’st now that in thee fades not quite
400,2,444,Thy father’s wisdom; and that future light
400,2,445,"Shall therefore show thee far from being unwise,"
400,2,446,Or touch’d with stain of bastard cowardice.
400,2,447,"Hope therefore says, that thou wilt to the end"
400,2,448,Pursue the brave act thou didst erst intend.
400,2,449,"But for the foolish Wooers, they bewray"
400,2,450,"They neither counsel have nor soul, since they"
400,2,451,"Are neither wise nor just, and so must needs"
400,2,452,Rest ignorant how black above their heads
400,2,453,"Fate hovers holding Death, that one sole day"
400,2,454,Will make enough to make them all away.
400,2,455,"For thee, the way thou wishest shall no more"
400,2,456,"Fly thee a step; I, that have been before"
400,2,457,"Thy father’s friend, thine likewise now will be,"
400,2,458,"Provide thy ship myself, and follow thee."
400,2,459,"Go thou then home, and sooth each Wooer’s vein,"
400,2,460,But under hand fit all things for the main;
400,2,461,"Wine in as strong and sweet casks as you can,"
400,2,462,"And meal, the very marrow of a man,"
400,2,463,"Which put in good sure leather sacks, and see"
400,2,464,That with sweet food sweet vessels still agree.
400,2,465,I from the people straight will press for you
400,2,466,"Free voluntaries; and, for ships, enow"
400,2,467,"Sea - circled Ithaca contains, both new"
400,2,468,"And old - built; all which I’ll exactly view,"
400,2,469,And choose what one soever most doth please;
400,2,470,"Which rigg’d, we’ll straight launch, and assay the seas.”"
400,2,471,"This spake Jove’s daughter, Pallas; whose voice heard,"
400,2,472,"No more Telemachus her charge deferr’d,"
400,2,473,"But hasted home, and, sad at heart, did see"
400,2,474,Amidst his hall th’ insulting Wooers flea
400,2,475,"Goats, and roast swine. ’Mongst whom, Antinous"
400,2,476,"Careless, discov’ring in Telemachus"
400,2,477,"His grudge to see them, laugh’d, met, took his hand,"
400,2,478,"And said: “High - spoken, with the mind so mann’d!"
400,2,479,"Come, do as we do, put not up your spirits"
400,2,480,"With these low trifles, nor our loving merits"
400,2,481,"In gall of any hateful purpose steep,"
400,2,482,"But eat egregiously, and drink as deep."
400,2,483,"The things thou think’st on, all at full shall be"
400,2,484,"By th’ Achives thought on, and perform’d to thee;"
400,2,485,"Ship, and choice oars, that in a trice will land"
400,2,486,"Thy hasty fleet on heav’nly Pylos’ sand,"
400,2,487,And at the fame of thy illustrious sire.”
400,2,488,"He answer’d: “Men, whom pride did so inspire,"
400,2,489,Are not fit consorts for an humble guest;
400,2,490,Nor are constrain’d men merry at their feast.
400,2,491,"Is ’t not enough, that all this time ye have"
400,2,492,"Op’d in your entrails my chief goods a grave,"
400,2,493,"And, while I was a child, made me partake?"
400,2,494,"My now more growth more grown my mind doth make,"
400,2,495,"And, hearing speak more judging men than you,"
400,2,496,Perceive how much I was misgovern’d now.
400,2,497,I now will try if I can bring ye home
400,2,498,An ill Fate to consort you; if it come
400,2,499,"From Pylos, or amongst the people here."
400,2,500,"But thither I resolve, and know that there"
400,2,501,"I shall not touch in vain. Nor will I stay,"
400,2,502,Though in a merchant’s ship I steer my way;
400,2,503,Which shows in your sights best; since me ye know
400,2,504,"Incapable of ship, or men to row.”"
400,2,505,"This said, his hand he coyly snatch’d away"
400,2,506,From forth Antinous’ hand. The rest the day
400,2,507,"Spent through the house with banquets; some with jests,"
400,2,508,"And some with railings, dignifying their feasts."
400,2,509,To whom a jest - proud youth the wit began:
400,2,510,“Telemachus will kill us ev’ry man.
400,2,511,"From Sparta, to the very Pylian sand,"
400,2,512,He will raise aids to his impetuous hand.
400,2,513,O he affects it strangely! Or he means
400,2,514,"To search Ephyra’s fat shores, and from thence"
400,2,515,"Bring deathful poisons, which amongst our bowls"
400,2,516,Will make a general shipwrack of our souls.”
400,2,517,"Another said: “Alas, who knows but he"
400,2,518,"Once gone, and erring like his sire at sea,"
400,2,519,"May perish like him, far from aid of friends,"
400,2,520,And so he makes us work? For all the ends
400,2,521,"Left of his goods here we shall share, the house"
400,2,522,Left to his mother and her chosen spouse.”
400,2,523,"Thus they; while he a room ascended, high"
400,2,524,"And large, built by his father, where did lie"
400,2,525,"Gold and brass heap’d up, and in coffers were"
400,2,526,"Rich robes, great store of odorous oils, and there"
400,2,527,"Stood tuns of sweet old wines along the wall,"
400,2,528,"Neat and divine drink, kept to cheer with all"
400,2,529,"Ulysses’ old heart, if he turn’d again"
400,2,530,From labours fatal to him to sustain.
400,2,531,"The doors of plank were, their close exquisite,"
400,2,532,"Kept with a double key, and day and night"
400,2,533,A woman lock’d within; and that was she
400,2,534,"Who all trust had for her sufficiency,"
400,2,535,"Old Euryclea, one of Opis’ race,"
400,2,536,"Son to Pisenor, and in passing grace"
400,2,537,"With grey Minerva; her the prince did call,"
400,2,538,And said: “Nurse! Draw me the most sweet of all
400,2,539,The wine thou keep’st; next that which for my sire
400,2,540,"Thy care reserves, in hope he shall retire."
400,2,541,"Twelve vessels fill me forth, and stop them well."
400,2,542,Then into well - sew’d sacks of fine ground meal
400,2,543,"Pour twenty measures. Nor, to anyone"
400,2,544,"But thee thyself, let this design be known."
400,2,545,All this see got together; I it all
400,2,546,"In night will fetch off, when my mother shall"
400,2,547,"Ascend her high room, and for sleep prepare."
400,2,548,"Sparta and Pylos I must see, in care"
400,2,549,"To find my father.” Out Euryclea cried,"
400,2,550,And ask’d with tears: “Why is your mind applied.
400,2,551,"Dear son, to this course? Whither will you go?"
400,2,552,"So far off leave us, and belovéd so,"
400,2,553,So only? And the sole hope of your race?
400,2,554,"Royal Ulysses, far from the embrace"
400,2,555,"Of his kind country, in a land unknown"
400,2,556,"Is dead; and, you from your lov’d country gone,"
400,2,557,The Wooers will with some deceit assay
400,2,558,"To your destruction, making then their prey"
400,2,559,"Of all your goods. Where, in your own y’are strong,"
400,2,560,Make sure abode. It fits not you so young
400,2,561,"To suffer so much by the aged seas,"
400,2,562,And err in such a wayless wilderness.”
400,2,563,"“Be cheer’d, lov’d nurse,” said he, “for, not without"
400,2,564,"The will of God, go my attempts about."
400,2,565,"Swear therefore, not to wound my mother’s ears"
400,2,566,"With word of this, before from heav’n appears"
400,2,567,"Th’ elev’nth or twelfth light, or herself shall please"
400,2,568,"To ask of me, or hears me put to seas,"
400,2,569,Lest her fair body with her woe be wore.”
400,2,570,To this the great oath of the Gods she swore;
400,2,571,"Which having sworn, and of it every due"
400,2,572,"Perform’d to full, to vessels wine she drew,"
400,2,573,And into well - sew’d sacks pour’d foody meal.
400,2,574,"In mean time he, with cunning to conceal"
400,2,575,"All thought of this from others, himself bore"
400,2,576,"In broad house, with the Wooers, as before."
400,2,577,"Then grey - eyed Pallas other thoughts did own,"
400,2,578,"And like Telemachus trod through the town,"
400,2,579,Commanding all his men in th’ even to be
400,2,580,Aboard his ship. Again then question’d she
400,2,581,"Noënon, fam’d for aged Phronius’ son,"
400,2,582,About his ship; who all things to be done
400,2,583,"Assur’d her freely should. The sun then set,"
400,2,584,"And sable shadows slid through ev’ry street,"
400,2,585,"When forth they launch’d, and soon aboard did bring"
400,2,586,"All arms, and choice of ev’ry needful thing"
400,2,587,That fits a well - rigg’d ship. The Goddess then
400,2,588,"Stood in the port’s extreme part, where her men,"
400,2,589,"Nobly appointed, thick about her came,"
400,2,590,Whose ev’ry breast she did with spirit enflame.
400,2,591,Yet still fresh projects laid the grey - eyed Dame.
400,2,592,"Straight to the house she hasted, and sweet sleep"
400,2,593,Pour’d on each Wooer; which so laid in steep
400,2,594,"Their drowsy temples, that each brow did nod,"
400,2,595,"As all were drinking, and each hand his load,"
400,2,596,"The cup, let fall. All start up, and to bed,"
400,2,597,"Nor more would watch, when sleep so surfeited"
400,2,598,Their leaden eye - lids. Then did Pallas call
400,2,599,"Telemachus, in body, voice, and all,"
400,2,600,"Resembling Mentor, from his native nest,"
400,2,601,"And said, that all his arm’d men were addrest"
400,2,602,"To use their oars, and all expected now"
400,2,603,He should the spirit of a soldier show.
400,2,604,"“Come then,” said she, “no more let us defer"
400,2,605,Our honour’d action.” Then she took on her
400,2,606,"A ravish’d spirit, and led as she did leap;"
400,2,607,And he her most haste took out step by step.
400,2,608,"Arrived at sea and ship, they found ashore"
400,2,609,The soldiers that their fashion’d - long hair wore;
400,2,610,"To whom the prince said: “Come, my friends, let’s bring"
400,2,611,Our voyage’s provision; ev’ry thing
400,2,612,"Is heap’d together in our court; and none,"
400,2,613,"No not my mother, nor her maids, but one"
400,2,614,"Knows our intention.” This express’d, he led,"
400,2,615,The soldiers close together followed;
400,2,616,And all together brought aboard their store.
400,2,617,Aboard the prince went; Pallas still before
400,2,618,"Sat at the stern, he close to her, the men"
400,2,619,Up hasted after. He and Pallas then
400,2,620,Put from the shore. His soldiers then he bad
400,2,621,"See all their arms fit; which they heard, and had."
400,2,622,"A beechen mast, then, in the hollow base"
400,2,623,"They put, and hoisted, fix’d it in its place"
400,2,624,With cables; and with well - wreath’d halsers hoise
400,2,625,"Their white sails, which grey Pallas now employs"
400,2,626,With full and fore - gales through the dark deep main.

400,2,628,"Against the ship sides, that now ran and plow’d"
400,2,629,The rugged seas up. Then the men bestow’d
400,2,630,"Their arms about the ship, and sacrifice"
400,2,631,With crown’d wine - cups to th’ endless Deities
400,2,632,"They offer’d up. Of all yet thron’d above,"
400,2,633,They most observ’d the grey - eyed seed of Jove;
400,2,634,"Who, from the evening till the morning rose,"
400,2,635,And all day long their voyage did dispose.

400,3,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,3,2,"Telemachus, and Heav’n’s wise Dame"
400,3,3,"That never husband had, now came"
400,3,4,To Nestor; who his either guest
400,3,5,Receiv’d at the religious feast
400,3,6,"He made to Neptune, on his shore;"
400,3,7,And there told what was done before
400,3,8,"The Trojan turrets, and the state"
400,3,9,Of all the Greeks since Ilion’s fate.
400,3,10,This book these three of greatest place
400,3,11,Doth serve with many a varied grace.
400,3,12,"Which past, Minerva takes her leave."
400,3,13,"Whose state when Nestor doth perceive,"
400,3,14,"With sacrifice he makes it known,"
400,3,15,Where many a pleasing rite is shown.
400,3,16,"Which done, Telemachus hath gain’d"
400,3,17,A chariot of him; who ordain’d
400,3,18,"Pisistratus, his son, his guide"
400,3,19,To Sparta; and when starry eyed
400,3,20,"The ample heav’n began to be,"
400,3,21,"All house - rites to afford them free,"
400,3,22,"In Pheris, Diocles did please,"
400,3,23,His surname Ortilochides.
400,3,24,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,3,25,_Γἀμμα._
400,3,26,Ulysses’ son
400,3,27,"With Nestor lies,"
400,3,28,To Sparta gone;
400,3,29,Thence Pallas flies.
400,3,30,"The sun now left the great and goodly lake,"
400,3,31,"And to the firm heav’n bright ascent did make,"
400,3,32,"To shine as well upon the mortal birth,"
400,3,33,"Inhabiting the plow’d life - giving earth,"
400,3,34,As on the ever - treaders upon death.
400,3,35,"And now to Pylos, that so garnisheth"
400,3,36,"Herself with buildings, old Neleus’ town,"
400,3,37,"The prince and Goddess come had strange sights shown,"
400,3,38,"For, on the marine shore, the people there"
400,3,39,"To Neptune, that the azure locks doth wear,"
400,3,40,Beeves that were wholly black gave holy flame.
400,3,41,Nine seats of state they made to his high name;
400,3,42,"And ev’ry seat set with five hundred men,"
400,3,43,And each five hundred was to furnish then
400,3,44,With nine black oxen ev’ry sacred seat.
400,3,45,"These of the entrails only pleas’d to eat,"
400,3,46,And to the God enflam’d the fleshy thighs.
400,3,47,"By this time Pallas with the sparkling eyes,"
400,3,48,"And he she led, within the haven bore,"
400,3,49,"Struck sail, cast anchor, and trod both the shore,"
400,3,50,"She first, he after. Then said Pallas: “Now"
400,3,51,No more befits thee the least bashful brow;
400,3,52,"T’ embolden which this act is put on thee,"
400,3,53,"To seek thy father both at shore and sea,"
400,3,54,"And learn in what clime he abides so close,"
400,3,55,Or in the pow’r of what Fate doth repose.
400,3,56,"Come then, go right to Nestor; let us see,"
400,3,57,"If in his bosom any counsel be,"
400,3,58,That may inform us. Pray him not to trace
400,3,59,"The common courtship, and to speak in grace"
400,3,60,"Of the demander, but to tell the truth;"
400,3,61,"Which will delight him, and commend thy youth"
400,3,62,"For such prevention; for he loves no lies,"
400,3,63,"Nor will report them, being truly wise.”"
400,3,64,"He answer’d: “Mentor! how, alas! shall I"
400,3,65,Present myself? How greet his gravity?
400,3,66,"My youth by no means that ripe form affords,"
400,3,67,That can digest my mind’s instinct in words
400,3,68,"Wise, and beseeming th’ ears of one so sage."
400,3,69,Youth of most hope blush to use words with age.”
400,3,70,"She said: “Thy mind will some conceit impress,"
400,3,71,And something God will prompt thy towardness;
400,3,72,"For, I suppose, thy birth, and breeding too,"
400,3,73,Were not in spite of what the Gods could do.”
400,3,74,"This said, she swiftly went before, and he"
400,3,75,"Her steps made guides, and follow’d instantly."
400,3,76,"When soon they reach’d the Pylian throngs and seats,"
400,3,77,"Where Nestor with his sons sat; and the meats,"
400,3,78,"That for the feast serv’d, round about them were"
400,3,79,"Adherents dressing, all their sacred cheer,"
400,3,80,Being roast and boil’d meats. When the Pylians saw
400,3,81,"These strangers come, in thrust did all men draw"
400,3,82,"About their entry, took their hands, and pray’d"
400,3,83,They both would sit; their entry first assay’d
400,3,84,"By Nestor’s son, Pisistratus. In grace"
400,3,85,"Of whose repair, he gave them honour’d place"
400,3,86,"Betwixt his sire and brother Thrasymed,"
400,3,87,Who sat at feast on soft fells that were spread
400,3,88,"Along the sea sands, kerv’d, and reach’d to them"
400,3,89,"Parts of the inwards, and did make a stream"
400,3,90,Of spritely wine into a golden bowl;
400,3,91,Which to Minerva with a gentle soul
400,3,92,"He gave, and thus spake: “Ere you eat, fair guest,"
400,3,93,"Invoke the Seas’ King, of whose sacred feast"
400,3,94,Your travel hither makes ye partners now;
400,3,95,"When, sacrificing as becomes, bestow"
400,3,96,"This bowl of sweet wine on your friend, that he"
400,3,97,May likewise use these rites of piety;
400,3,98,"For I suppose his youth doth prayers use,"
400,3,99,Since all men need the Gods. But you I choose
400,3,100,"First in this cup’s disposure, since his years"
400,3,101,"Seem short of yours, who more like me appears.”"
400,3,102,Thus gave he her the cup of pleasant wine;
400,3,103,And since a wise and just man did design
400,3,104,"The golden bowl first to her free receit,"
400,3,105,"Ev’n to the Goddess it did add delight,"
400,3,106,"Who thus invok’d: “Hear thou, whose vast embrace"
400,3,107,"Enspheres the whole earth, nor disdain thy grace"
400,3,108,To us that ask it in performing this:
400,3,109,"To Nestor first, and these fair sons of his,"
400,3,110,"Vouchsafe all honour; and, next them, bestow"
400,3,111,"On all these Pylians, that have offer’d now"
400,3,112,"This most renowned hecatomb to thee,"
400,3,113,"Remuneration fit for them, and free;"
400,3,114,"And lastly deign Telemachus and me,"
400,3,115,"The work perform’d for whose effect we came,"
400,3,116,"Our safe return, both with our ship and fame.”"
400,3,117,"Thus pray’d she; and herself herself obey’d,"
400,3,118,In th’ end performing all for which she pray’d.
400,3,119,"And now, to pray, and do as she had done,"
400,3,120,She gave the fair round bowl t’ Ulysses’ son.
400,3,121,"The meat then dress’d, and drawn, and serv’d t’ each guest,"
400,3,122,They celebrated a most sumptuous feast.
400,3,123,"When appetite to wine and food allay’d,"
400,3,124,"Horse - taming Nestor then began, and said:"
400,3,125,"“Now life’s desire is serv’d, as far as fare,"
400,3,126,Time fits me to enquire what guests these are.
400,3,127,"Fair guests, what are ye? And for what coast tries"
400,3,128,Your ship the moist deeps? For fit merchandise?
400,3,129,"Or rudely coast ye, like our men of prise,"
400,3,130,"The rough seas tempting, desperately erring,"
400,3,131,The ill of others in their good conferring?”
400,3,132,"The wise prince now his boldness did begin,"
400,3,133,"For Pallas’ self had harden’d him within,"
400,3,134,By this device of travel to explore
400,3,135,His absent father; which two girlonds wore;
400,3,136,His good by manage of his spirits; and then
400,3,137,To gain him high grace in th’ accounts of men.
400,3,138,“O Nestor! still in whom Nelëus lives!
400,3,139,"And all the glory of the Greeks survives,"
400,3,140,"You ask from whence we are, and I relate:"
400,3,141,From Ithaca (whose seat is situate
400,3,142,"Where Neius, the renownéd mountain, rears"
400,3,143,"His haughty forehead, and the honour bears"
400,3,144,To be our sea - mark) we assay’d the waves.
400,3,145,"The business, I must tell, our own good craves,"
400,3,146,"And not the public. I am come t’ enquire,"
400,3,147,"If, in the fame that best men doth inspire"
400,3,148,"Of my most - suff’ring father, I may hear"
400,3,149,"Some truth of his estate now, who did bear"
400,3,150,"The name, being join’d in fight with you alone,"
400,3,151,To even with earth the height of Ilion.
400,3,152,"Of all men else, that any name did bear,"
400,3,153,"And fought for Troy, the sev’ral ends we hear;"
400,3,154,"But his death Jove keeps from the world unknown,"
400,3,155,The certain fame thereof being told by none;
400,3,156,"If on the continent by enemies slain,"
400,3,157,Or with the waves eat of the ravenous main.
400,3,158,"For his love ’tis that to your knees I sue,"
400,3,159,"That you would please, out of your own clear view,"
400,3,160,"T’ assure his sad end; or say, if your ear"
400,3,161,"Hath heard of the unhappy wanderer,"
400,3,162,To too much sorrow whom his mother bore.
400,3,163,"You then by all your bounties I implore,"
400,3,164,"(If ever to you deed or word hath stood,"
400,3,165,"By my good father promis’d, render’d good"
400,3,166,"Amongst the Trojans, where ye both have tried"
400,3,167,The Grecian suff’rance) that in nought applied
400,3,168,"To my respect or pity you will glose,"
400,3,169,But uncloth’d truth to my desires disclose.”
400,3,170,"“O my much - lov’d,” said he, “since you renew"
400,3,171,Remembrance of the miseries that grew
400,3,172,Upon our still - in - strength - opposing Greece
400,3,173,"Amongst Troy’s people, I must touch a piece"
400,3,174,"Of all our woes there, either in the men"
400,3,175,Achilles brought by sea and led to gain
400,3,176,"About the country, or in us that fought"
400,3,177,"About the city, where to death were brought"
400,3,178,"All our chief men, as many as were there."
400,3,179,There Mars - like Ajax lies; Achilles there;
400,3,180,"There the in - counsel - like - the - Gods, his friend;"
400,3,181,"There my dear son Antilochus took end,"
400,3,182,"Past measure swift of foot, and staid in fight."
400,3,183,A number more that ills felt infinite;
400,3,184,"Of which to reckon all, what mortal man,"
400,3,185,"If five or six years you should stay here, can"
400,3,186,"Serve such enquiry? You would back again,"
400,3,187,"Affected with unsufferable pain,"
400,3,188,"Before you heard it. Nine years sieg’d we them,"
400,3,189,With all the depth and sleight of stratagem
400,3,190,That could be thought. Ill knit to ill past end.
400,3,191,Yet still they toil’d us; nor would yet Jove send
400,3,192,"Rest to our labours, nor will scarcely yet."
400,3,193,"But no man liv’d, that would in public set"
400,3,194,"His wisdom by Ulysses’ policy,"
400,3,195,As thought his equal; so excessively
400,3,196,He stood superior all ways. If you be
400,3,197,"His son indeed, mine eyes ev’n ravish me"
400,3,198,To admiration. And in all consent
400,3,199,Your speech puts on his speech’s ornament.
400,3,200,"Nor would one say, that one so young could use,"
400,3,201,"Unless his son, a rhetoric so profuse."
400,3,202,"And while we liv’d together, he and I"
400,3,203,Never in speech maintain’d diversity;
400,3,204,"Nor sat in council but, by one soul led,"
400,3,205,With spirit and prudent counsel furnishéd
400,3,206,"The Greeks at all hours, that, with fairest course,"
400,3,207,"What best became them, they might put in force."
400,3,208,"But when Troy’s’ high tow’rs we had levell’d thus,"
400,3,209,"We put to sea, and God divided us."
400,3,210,And then did Jove our sad retreat devise;
400,3,211,"For all the Greeks were neither just nor wise,"
400,3,212,"And therefore many felt so sharp a fate,"
400,3,213,Sent from Minerva’s most pernicious hate;
400,3,214,Whose mighty Father can do fearful things.
400,3,215,By whose help she betwixt the brother kings
400,3,216,Let fall contention; who in council met
400,3,217,"In vain, and timeless, when the sun was set,"
400,3,218,"And all the Greeks call’d, that came charg’d with wine."
400,3,219,"Yet then the kings would utter their design,"
400,3,220,"And why they summon’d. Menelaus, he"
400,3,221,"Put all in mind of home, and cried, To sea."
400,3,222,"But Agamemnon stood on contraries,"
400,3,223,"Whose will was, they should stay and sacrifice"
400,3,224,"Whole hecatombs to Pallas, to forego"
400,3,225,Her high wrath to them. Fool! that did not know
400,3,226,She would not so be won; for not with ease
400,3,227,Th’ Eternal Gods are turn’d from what they please.
400,3,228,"So they, divided, on foul language stood."
400,3,229,"The Greeks in huge rout rose, their wine - heat blood"
400,3,230,"Two ways affecting. And, that night’s sleep too,"
400,3,231,We turn’d to studying either other’s woe;
400,3,232,When Jove besides made ready woes enow.
400,3,233,"Morn came, we launch’d, and in our ships did stow"
400,3,234,"Our goods, and fair - girt women. Half our men"
400,3,235,"The people’s guide, Atrides, did contain,"
400,3,236,"And half, being now aboard, put forth to sea."
400,3,237,A most free gale gave all ships prosp’rous way.
400,3,238,"God settled then the huge whale - bearing lake,"
400,3,239,"And Tenedos we reach’d; where, for time’s sake,"
400,3,240,"We did divine rites to the Gods. But Jove,"
400,3,241,"Inexorable still, bore yet no love"
400,3,242,"To our return, but did again excite"
400,3,243,"A second sad contention, that turn’d quite"
400,3,244,A great part of us back to sea again;
400,3,245,"Which were th’ abundant - in - all - counsels man,"
400,3,246,"Your matchless father, who, to gratify"
400,3,247,"The great Atrides, back to him did fly."
400,3,248,"But I fled all, with all that follow’d me,"
400,3,249,"Because I knew God studied misery,"
400,3,250,To hurl amongst us. With me likewise fled
400,3,251,Martial Tydides. I the men he led
400,3,252,Gat to go with him. Winds our fleet did bring
400,3,253,"To Lesbos, where the yellow - headed king,"
400,3,254,"Though late, yet found us, as we put to choice"
400,3,255,A tedious voyage; if we sail should hoise
400,3,256,"Above rough Chius, left on our left hand,"
400,3,257,"To th’ isle of Psyria, or that rugged land"
400,3,258,"Sail under, and for windy Mimas steer."
400,3,259,We ask’d of God that some ostent might clear
400,3,260,"Our cloudy business, who gave us sign,"
400,3,261,"And charge, that all should, in a middle line,"
400,3,262,"The sea cut for Eubœa, that with speed"
400,3,263,Our long - sustain’d infortune might be freed.
400,3,264,"Then did a whistling wind begin to rise,"
400,3,265,"And swiftly flew we through the fishy skies,"
400,3,266,Till to Geræstus we in night were brought;
400,3,267,"Where, through the broad sea since we safe had wrought,"
400,3,268,At Neptune’s altars many solid thighs
400,3,269,Of slaughter’d bulls we burn’d for sacrifice.
400,3,270,"The fourth day came, when Tydeus’ son did greet"
400,3,271,The haven of Argos with his cómplete fleet.
400,3,272,But I for Pylos straight steer’d on my course;
400,3,273,"Nor ever left the wind his foreright force,"
400,3,274,"Since God fore - sent it first. And thus I came,"
400,3,275,"Dear son, to Pylos, uninform’d by fame,"
400,3,276,"Nor know one sav’d by Fate, or overcome."
400,3,277,"Whom I have heard of since, set here at home,"
400,3,278,"As fits, thou shalt be taught, nought left unshown."
400,3,279,"The expert spear - men, ev’ry Myrmidon,"
400,3,280,Led by the brave heir of the mighty - soul’d
400,3,281,"Unpeer’d Achilles, safe of home got hold;"
400,3,282,"Safe Philoctetes, Pœan’s famous seed;"
400,3,283,And safe Idomenæus his men led
400,3,284,"To his home, Crete, who fled the arméd field,"
400,3,285,Of whom yet none the sea from him withheld.
400,3,286,"Atrides, you have both heard, though ye be"
400,3,287,"His far - off dwellers, what an end had he,"
400,3,288,Done by Ægisthus to a bitter death;
400,3,289,"Who miserably paid for forcéd breath,"
400,3,290,"Atrides leaving a good son, that dyed,"
400,3,291,"In blood of that deceitful parricide,"
400,3,292,"His wreakful sword. And thou my friend, as he"
400,3,293,"For this hath his fame, the like spirit in thee"
400,3,294,"Assume at all parts. Fair and great, I see,"
400,3,295,"Thou art in all hope, make it good to th’ end,"
400,3,296,That after - times as much may thee commend.”
400,3,297,"He answer’d: “O thou greatest grace of Greece,"
400,3,298,"Orestes made that wreak his master - piece,"
400,3,299,"And him the Greeks will give a master - praise,"
400,3,300,Verse finding him to last all after - days.
400,3,301,And would to God the Gods would favour me
400,3,302,"With his performance, that my injury,"
400,3,303,"Done by my mother’s Wooers, being so foul,"
400,3,304,I might revenge upon their ev’ry soul;
400,3,305,"Who, pressing me with contumelies, dare"
400,3,306,Such things as past the pow’r of utt’rance are.
400,3,307,But Heav’n’s great Pow’rs have grac’d my destiny
400,3,308,With no such honour. Both my sire and I
400,3,309,Are born to suffer everlastingly.”
400,3,310,"“Because you name those Wooers, friend,” said he,"
400,3,311,"“Report says, many such, in spite of thee,"
400,3,312,"Wooing thy mother, in thy house commit"
400,3,313,The ills thou nam’st. But say: Proceedeth it
400,3,314,From will in thee to bear so foul a foil?
400,3,315,"Or from thy subjects’ hate, that wish thy spoil,"
400,3,316,"And will not aid thee, since their spirits rely,"
400,3,317,"Against thy rule, on some grave augury?"
400,3,318,"What know they, but at length thy father may"
400,3,319,"Come, and with violence their violence pay;"
400,3,320,"Or he alone, or all the Greeks with him?"
400,3,321,But if Minerva now did so esteem
400,3,322,"Thee, as thy father in times past; whom, past"
400,3,323,"All measure, she with glorious favours grac’t"
400,3,324,"Amongst the Trojans, where we suffer’d so;"
400,3,325,"(O! I did never see, in such clear show,"
400,3,326,"The Gods so grace a man, as she to him,"
400,3,327,"To all our eyes, appear’d in all her trim)"
400,3,328,"If so, I say, she would be pleas’d to love,"
400,3,329,"And that her mind’s care thou so much couldst move,"
400,3,330,"As did thy father, ev’ry man of these"
400,3,331,Would lose in death their seeking marriages.”
400,3,332,"“O father,” answer’d he, “you make amaze"
400,3,333,Seize me throughout. Beyond the height of phrase
400,3,334,"You raise expression; but ’twill never be,"
400,3,335,That I shall move in any Deity
400,3,336,"So blest an honour. Not by any means,"
400,3,337,"If Hope should prompt me, or blind Confidence,"
400,3,338,(The Gods of Fools) or ev’ry Deity
400,3,339,Should will it; for ’tis past my destiny.”
400,3,340,The burning - eyed Dame answer’d: “What a speech
400,3,341,Hath past the teeth - guard Nature gave to teach
400,3,342,Fit question of thy words before they fly!
400,3,343,God easily can[1] (when to mortal eye
400,3,344,He’s furthest off) a mortal satisfy;
400,3,345,"And does the more still. For thy car’d - for sire,"
400,3,346,"I rather wish, that I might home retire,"
400,3,347,"After my suff’rance of a world of woes,"
400,3,348,"Far off, and then my glad eyes might disclose"
400,3,349,"The day of my return, then straight retire,"
400,3,350,And perish standing by my household fire;
400,3,351,"As Agamemnon did, that lost his life"
400,3,352,"By false Ægisthus, and his falser wife."
400,3,353,"For Death to come at length, ’tis due to all;"
400,3,354,"Nor can the Gods themselves, when Fate shall call"
400,3,355,"Their most - lov’d man, extend his vital breath"
400,3,356,Beyond the fix’d bounds of abhorréd Death.”
400,3,357,"“Mentor!” said he, “let’s dwell no more on this,"
400,3,358,Although in us the sorrow pious is.
400,3,359,"No such return, as we wish, Fates bequeath"
400,3,360,My erring father; whom a present death
400,3,361,The Deathless have decreed. I’ll now use speech
400,3,362,That tends to other purpose; and beseech
400,3,363,"Instruction of grave Nestor, since he flows"
400,3,364,"Past shore in all experience, and knows"
400,3,365,"The sleights and wisdoms, and whose heights aspire"
400,3,366,"Others, as well as my commended sire,"
400,3,367,Whom Fame reports to have commanded three
400,3,368,"Ages of men, and doth in sight to me"
400,3,369,Show like th’ Immortals. Nestor! the renown
400,3,370,"Of old Neleius, make the clear truth known,"
400,3,371,"How the most - great - in - empire, Atreus’ son,"
400,3,372,"Sustain’d the act of his destruction,"
400,3,373,Where then was Menelaus? How was it
400,3,374,"That false Ægisthus, being so far unfit"
400,3,375,"A match for him, could his death so enforce?"
400,3,376,Was he not then in Argos? or his course
400,3,377,"With men so left, to let a coward breathe"
400,3,378,Spirit enough to dare his brother’s death?”
400,3,379,"“I’ll tell thee truth in all, fair son,” said he:"
400,3,380,“Right well was this event conceiv’d by thee.
400,3,381,If Menelaus in his brother’s house
400,3,382,"Had found the idle liver with his spouse,"
400,3,383,"Arriv’d from Troy, he had not liv’d, nor dead"
400,3,384,"Had the digg’d heap pour’d on his lustful head,"
400,3,385,"But fowls and dogs had torn him in the fields,"
400,3,386,Far off of Argos; not a dame it yields
400,3,387,"Had giv’n him any tear, so foul his fact"
400,3,388,Show’d ev’n to women. Us Troy’s wars had rack’d
400,3,389,"To ev’ry sinew’s sufferance, while he"
400,3,390,"In Argos’ uplands liv’d, from those works free,"
400,3,391,And Agamemnon’s wife with force of word
400,3,392,"Flatter’d and soften’d, who, at first, abhorr’d"
400,3,393,A fact so infamous. The heav’nly dame
400,3,394,"A good mind had, but was in blood to blame."
400,3,395,"There was a poet, to whose care the king"
400,3,396,"His queen committed, and in ev’ry thing,"
400,3,397,"When he from Troy went, charg’d him to apply"
400,3,398,Himself in all guard to her dignity.
400,3,399,"But when strong Fate so wrapt - in her effects,"
400,3,400,"That she resolv’d to leave her fit respects,"
400,3,401,"Into a desert isle her guardian led,"
400,3,402,"There left, the rapine of the vultures fed."
400,3,403,"Then brought he willing home his will’s won prize,"
400,3,404,"On sacred altars offer’d many thighs,"
400,3,405,"Hung in the God’s fanes many ornaments,"
400,3,406,"Garments and gold, that he the vast events"
400,3,407,"Of such a labour to his wish had brought,"
400,3,408,As neither fell into his hope nor thought.
400,3,409,"At last, from Troy sail’d Sparta’s king and I,"
400,3,410,"Both holding her untouch’d. And, that his eye"
400,3,411,"Might see no worse of her, when both were blown"
400,3,412,"To sacred Sunium, of Minerva’s town"
400,3,413,"The goodly promontory, with his shafts severe"
400,3,414,Augur Apollo slew him that did steer
400,3,415,"Atrides’ ship, as he the stern did guide,"
400,3,416,And she the full speed of her sail applied.
400,3,417,He was a man that natións of men
400,3,418,"Excell’d in safe guide of a vessel, when"
400,3,419,A tempest rush’d in on the ruffled seas;
400,3,420,His name was Phrontis Onetorides.
400,3,421,"And thus was Menelaus held from home,"
400,3,422,"Whose way he thirsted so to overcome,"
400,3,423,"To give his friend the earth, being his pursuit,"
400,3,424,And all his exequies to execute.
400,3,425,"But sailing still the wine - hued seas,[2] to reach"
400,3,426,"Some shore for fit performance, he did fetch"
400,3,427,"The steep mount of the Malians, and there,"
400,3,428,"With open voice, offended Jupiter"
400,3,429,"Proclaim’d the voyage his repugnant mind,"
400,3,430,"And pour’d the puffs out of a shrieking wind,"
400,3,431,That nourish’d billows heighten’d like to hills;
400,3,432,And with the fleet’s division fulfills
400,3,433,His hate proclaim’d; upon a part of Crete
400,3,434,"Casting the navy, where the sea - waves meet"
400,3,435,"Rough Jardanus, and where the Cydons live."
400,3,436,"There is a rock, on which the sea doth drive,"
400,3,437,"Bare, and all broken, on the confines set"
400,3,438,"Of Gortys, that the dark seas likewise fret;"
400,3,439,And hither sent the South a horrid drift
400,3,440,"Of waves against the top, that was the left"
400,3,441,Of that torn cliff as far as Phæstus’ strand.
400,3,442,A little stone the great sea’s rage did stand.
400,3,443,"The men here driv’n ‘scap’d hard the ship’s sore shocks,"
400,3,444,"The ships themselves being wrack’d against the rocks,"
400,3,445,"Save only five, that blue fore - castles bore,"
400,3,446,Which wind and water cast on Egypt’s shore.
400,3,447,"When he (there victling well, and store of gold"
400,3,448,"Aboard his ships brought) his wild way did hold,"
400,3,449,And t’ other languag’d men was forc’d to roam.
400,3,450,"Mean space Ægisthus made sad work at home,"
400,3,451,"And slew his brother, forcing to his sway"
400,3,452,"Atrides’ subjects, and did sev’n years lay"
400,3,453,His yoke upon the rich Mycenian state.
400,3,454,"But in the eighth, to his affrighting fate,"
400,3,455,"Divine Orestes home from Athens came,"
400,3,456,"And what his royal father felt, the same"
400,3,457,He made the false Ægisthus groan beneath.
400,3,458,_Death evermore is the reward of death._
400,3,459,"Thus having slain him, a sepulchral feast"
400,3,460,"He made the Argives for his lustful guest,"
400,3,461,And for his mother whom he did detest.
400,3,462,The self - same day upon him stole the king
400,3,463,"Good - at - a - martial - shout, and goods did bring,"
400,3,464,As many as his freighted fleet could bear.
400,3,465,"But thou, my son, too long by no means err,"
400,3,466,"Thy goods left free for many a spoilful guest,"
400,3,467,"Lest they consume some, and divide the rest,"
400,3,468,"And thou, perhaps, besides, thy voyage lose."
400,3,469,To Menelaus yet thy course dispose
400,3,470,I wish and charge thee; who but late arriv’d
400,3,471,"From such a shore and men, as to have liv’d"
400,3,472,"In a return from them he never thought,"
400,3,473,And whom black whirlwinds violently brought
400,3,474,"Within a sea so vast, that in a year"
400,3,475,"Not any fowl could pass it anywhere,"
400,3,476,So huge and horrid was it. But go thou
400,3,477,"With ship and men (or, if thou pleasest now"
400,3,478,"To pass by land, there shall be brought for thee"
400,3,479,"Both horse and chariot, and thy guides shall be"
400,3,480,"My sons themselves) to Sparta the divine,"
400,3,481,And to the king whose locks like amber shine.
400,3,482,"Intreat the truth of him, nor loves he lies,"
400,3,483,"Wisdom in truth is, and he’s passing wise.”"
400,3,484,"This said, the Sun went down, and up rose Night,"
400,3,485,"When Pallas spake: “O father, all good right"
400,3,486,Bear thy directions. But divide we now
400,3,487,"The sacrifices’ tongues, mix wines, and vow"
400,3,488,"To Neptune, and the other Ever - Blest,"
400,3,489,"That, having sacrific’d, we may to rest."
400,3,490,"The fit hour runs now, light dives out of date,"
400,3,491,At sacred feasts we must not sit too late.”
400,3,492,She said; they heard; the heralds water gave;
400,3,493,"The youths crown’d cups with wine, and let all have"
400,3,494,"Their equal shares, beginning from the cup"
400,3,495,"Their parting banquet. All the tongues cut up,"
400,3,496,"The fire they gave them, sacrific’d, and rose,"
400,3,497,"Wine, and divine rites us’d, to each dispose;"
400,3,498,Minerva and Telemachus desir’d
400,3,499,"They might to ship be, with his leave, retir’d."
400,3,500,"He, mov’d with that, provok’d thus their abodes:"
400,3,501,"“Now Jove forbid, and all the long - liv’d Gods,"
400,3,502,"Your leaving me, to sleep aboard a ship;"
400,3,503,"As I had drunk of poor Penia’s whip,"
400,3,504,"Even to my nakedness, and had nor sheet"
400,3,505,Nor cov’ring in my house; that warm nor sweet
400,3,506,"A guest, nor I myself, had means to sleep;"
400,3,507,"Where I, both weeds and wealthy cov’rings keep"
400,3,508,"For all my guests. Nor shall Fame ever say,"
400,3,509,The dear son of the man Ulysses lay
400,3,510,"All night a - ship - board here while my days shine,"
400,3,511,Or in my court whiles any son of mine
400,3,512,"Enjoys survival, who shall guests receive,"
400,3,513,Whomever my house hath a nook to leave.”
400,3,514,"“My much - lov’d father,” said Minerva, “well"
400,3,515,All this becomes thee. But persuade to dwell
400,3,516,"This night with thee thy son Telemachus,"
400,3,517,"For more convenient is the course for us,"
400,3,518,"That he may follow to thy house and rest,"
400,3,519,"And I may board our black - sail, that addrest"
400,3,520,"At all parts I may make our men, and cheer"
400,3,521,"All with my presence, since of all men there"
400,3,522,"I boast myself the senior, th’ others are"
400,3,523,"Youths, that attend in free and friendly care"
400,3,524,"Great - soul’d Telemachus, and are his peers"
400,3,525,In fresh similitude of form and years.
400,3,526,"For their confirmance, I will therefore now"
400,3,527,"Sleep in our black bark. But, when light shall show"
400,3,528,"Her silver forehead, I intend my way"
400,3,529,"Amongst the Caucons, men that are to pay"
400,3,530,"A debt to me, nor small, nor new. For this,"
400,3,531,"Take you him home; whom in the morn dismiss,"
400,3,532,"With chariot and your sons, and give him horse"
400,3,533,"Ablest in strength, and of the speediest course”"
400,3,534,"This said, away she flew, form’d like the fowl"
400,3,535,Men call the ossifrage; when ev’ry soul
400,3,536,"Amaze invaded; even th’ old man admir’d,"
400,3,537,"The youth’s hand took, and said: “O most desir’d,"
400,3,538,"My hope says thy proof will no coward show,"
400,3,539,"Nor one unskill’d in war, when Deities now"
400,3,540,"So young attend thee, and become thy guides;"
400,3,541,"Nor any of the heav’n - hous’d States besides,"
400,3,542,"But Tritogenia’s self, the Seed of Jove,"
400,3,543,"The great - in - prey, that did in honour move"
400,3,544,"So much about thy father, amongst all"
400,3,545,"The Grecian army. Fairest queen, let fall"
400,3,546,On me like favours! Give me good renown!
400,3,547,"Which, as on me, on my lov’d wife let down,"
400,3,548,And all my children. I will burn to thee
400,3,549,"An ox right bred, broad - headed, and yoke - free,"
400,3,550,"To no man’s hand yet humbled. Him will I,"
400,3,551,"His horns in gold hid, give thy Deity.”"
400,3,552,"Thus pray’d he, and she heard; and home he led"
400,3,553,"His sons, and all his heaps of kindered."
400,3,554,"Who ent’ring his court royal, ev’ry one"
400,3,555,He marshall’d in his sev’ral seat and throne;
400,3,556,"And ev’ry one, so kindly come, he gave"
400,3,557,His sweet - wine cup; which none was let to have
400,3,558,Before his ‘leventh year landed him from Troy;
400,3,559,"Which now the butleress had leave t’ employ,"
400,3,560,"Who therefore pierc’d it, and did give it vent."
400,3,561,Of this the old duke did a cup present
400,3,562,To ev’ry guest; made his Maid many a pray’r
400,3,563,"That wears the shield fring’d with his nurse’s hair,"
400,3,564,And gave her sacrifice. With this rich wine
400,3,565,"And food suffic’d, sleep all eyes did decline,"
400,3,566,And all for home went; but his court alone
400,3,567,"Telemachus, divine Ulysses’ son,"
400,3,568,"Must make his lodging, or not please his heart."
400,3,569,"A bed, all chequer’d with elaborate art,"
400,3,570,"Within a portico that rung like brass,"
400,3,571,He brought his guest to; and his bedfere was
400,3,572,"Pisistratus, the martial guide of men,"
400,3,573,"That liv’d, of all his sons, unwed till then."
400,3,574,"Himself lay in a by - room, far above,"
400,3,575,"His bed made by his barren wife, his love."
400,3,576,"The rosy - finger’d Morn no sooner shone,"
400,3,577,"But up he rose, took air, and sat upon"
400,3,578,"A seat of white and goodly polish’d stone,"
400,3,579,"That such a gloss as richest ointments wore,"
400,3,580,Before his high gates; where the counsellor
400,3,581,"That match’d the Gods (his father) us’d to sit,"
400,3,582,"Who now, by fate forc’d, stoop’d as low as it."
400,3,583,"And here sat Nestor, holding in his hand"
400,3,584,"A sceptre; and about him round did stand,"
400,3,585,"As early up, his sons’ troop; Perseus,"
400,3,586,"The god - like Thrasymed, and Aretus,"
400,3,587,"Echephron, Stratius, and sixth and last"
400,3,588,"Pisistratus, and by him (half embrac’d"
400,3,589,Still as they came) divine Telemachus;
400,3,590,"To these spake Nestor, old Gerenius:"
400,3,591,"“Haste, lovéd sons, and do me a desire,"
400,3,592,"That, first of all the Gods, I may aspire"
400,3,593,"To Pallas’ favour, who vouchsaf’d to me"
400,3,594,At Neptune’s feast her sight so openly.
400,3,595,"Let one to field go, and an ox with speed"
400,3,596,"Cause hither brought, which let the herdsman lead;"
400,3,597,"Another to my dear guest’s vessel go,"
400,3,598,"And all his soldiers bring, save only two;"
400,3,599,A third the smith that works in gold command
400,3,600,"(Laertius) to attend, and lend his hand,"
400,3,601,To plate the both horns round about with gold;
400,3,602,"The rest remain here close. But first, see told"
400,3,603,"The maids within, that they prepare a feast,"
400,3,604,"Set seats through all the court, see straight addrest"
400,3,605,"The purest water, and get fuel fell’d.”"
400,3,606,"This said, not one but in the service held"
400,3,607,Officious hand. The ox came led from field;
400,3,608,"The soldiers troop’d from ship; the smith he came,"
400,3,609,And those tools brought that serv’d the actual frame
400,3,610,"His art conceiv’d, brought anvil, hammers brought,"
400,3,611,"Fair tongs, and all, with which the gold was wrought."
400,3,612,"Minerva likewise came, to set the crown"
400,3,613,"On that kind sacrifice, and make ’t her own."
400,3,614,"Then th’ old knight Nestor gave the smith the gold,"
400,3,615,"With which he straight did both the horns infold,"
400,3,616,"And trimm’d the off’ring so, the Goddess joy’d."
400,3,617,About which thus were Nestor’s sons employ’d:
400,3,618,"Divine Echephron, and fair Stratius,"
400,3,619,"Held both the horns. The water odorous,"
400,3,620,"In which they wash’d, what to the rites was vow’d,"
400,3,621,"Aretus, in a caldron all bestrow’d"
400,3,622,"With herbs and flowers, serv’d in from th’ holy room"
400,3,623,"Where all were drest, and whence the rites must come."
400,3,624,"And after him a hallow’d virgin came,"
400,3,625,"That brought the barley - cake, and blew the flame."
400,3,626,"The axe, with which the ox should both be fell’d"
400,3,627,"And cut forth, Thrasymed stood by and held."
400,3,628,Perseus the vessel held that should retain
400,3,629,The purple liquor of the off’ring slain.
400,3,630,"Then wash’d the pious father, then the cake"
400,3,631,"(Of barley, salt, and oil, made) took, and brake,"
400,3,632,"Ask’d many a boon of Pallas, and the state"
400,3,633,"Of all the off’ring did initiate,"
400,3,634,"In three parts cutting off the hair, and cast"
400,3,635,"Amidst the flame. All th’ invocation past,"
400,3,636,"And all the cake broke, manly Thrasymed"
400,3,637,"Stood near, and sure, and such a blow he laid"
400,3,638,"Aloft the off’ring, that to earth he sunk,"
400,3,639,"His neck - nerves sunder’d, and his spirits shrunk."
400,3,640,"Out shriek’d the daughters, daughter - in - laws, and wife"
400,3,641,"Of three - ag’d Nestor, who had eldest life"
400,3,642,"Of Clymen’s daughters, chaste Eurydice."
400,3,643,The ox on broad earth then laid laterally
400,3,644,"They held, while duke Pisistratus the throat"
400,3,645,"Dissolv’d, and set the sable blood afloat,"
400,3,646,And then the life the bones left. Instantly
400,3,647,"They cut him up; apart flew either thigh,"
400,3,648,"That with the fat they dubb’d, with art alone,"
400,3,649,"The throat - brisk, and the sweet - bread pricking on."
400,3,650,"Then Nestor broil’d them on the coal - turn’d wood,"
400,3,651,"Pour’d black wine on; and by him young men stood,"
400,3,652,"That spits fine - pointed held, on which, when burn’d"
400,3,653,"The solid thighs were, they transfix’d, and turn’d"
400,3,654,"The inwards, cut in cantles; which, the meat"
400,3,655,"Vow’d to the Gods consum’d, they roast and eat."
400,3,656,"In mean space, Polycasté (call’d the fair,"
400,3,657,Nestor’s young’st daughter) bath’d Ulysses’ heir;
400,3,658,"Whom having cleans’d, and with rich balms bespread,"
400,3,659,"She cast a white shirt quickly o’er his head,"
400,3,660,"And then his weeds put on; when forth he went,"
400,3,661,"And did the person of a God present,"
400,3,662,"Came, and by Nestor took his honour’d seat,"
400,3,663,"This pastor of the people. Then, the meat"
400,3,664,"Of all the spare parts roasted, off they drew,"
400,3,665,"Sat, and fell to. But soon the temp’rate few"
400,3,666,"Rose, and in golden bowls fill’d others wine."
400,3,667,"Till, when the rest felt thirst of feast decline,"
400,3,668,"Nestor his sons bad fetch his high - man’d horse,"
400,3,669,"And them in chariot join, to run the course"
400,3,670,"The prince resolv’d. Obey’d, as soon as heard,"
400,3,671,"Was Nestor by his sons, who straight prepar’d"
400,3,672,"Both horse and chariot. She that kept the store,"
400,3,673,"Both bread and wine, and all such viands more,"
400,3,674,"As should the feast of Jove - fed kings compose,"
400,3,675,Purvey’d the voyage. To the rich coach rose
400,3,676,"Ulysses’ son, and close to him ascended"
400,3,677,"The duke Pisistratus, the reins intended,"
400,3,678,"And scourg’d, to force to field, who freely flew;"
400,3,679,"And left the town that far her splendour threw,"
400,3,680,"Both holding yoke, and shook it all the day."
400,3,681,"But now the sun set, dark’ning ev’ry way,"
400,3,682,When they to Pheris came; and in the house
400,3,683,"Of Diocles (the son t’ Orsilochus,"
400,3,684,Whom flood Alphëus got) slept all that night;
400,3,685,Who gave them each due hospitable rite.
400,3,686,"But when the rosy - finger’d Morn arose,"
400,3,687,"They went to coach, and did their horse inclose,"
400,3,688,"Drave forth the fore - court, and the porch that yields"
400,3,689,"Each breath a sound, and to the fruitful fields"
400,3,690,"Rode scourging still their willing flying steeds,"
400,3,691,Who strenuously perform’d their wonted speeds.
400,3,692,"Their journey ending just when sun went down,"
400,3,693,And shadows all ways through the earth were thrown.

400,4,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,4,2,"Receiv’d now in the Spartan court,"
400,4,3,Telemachus prefers report
400,4,4,To Menelaus of the throng
400,4,5,"Of Wooers with him, and their wrong."
400,4,6,"Atrides tells the Greeks’ retreat,"
400,4,7,And doth a prophecy repeat
400,4,8,"That Proteus made, by which he knew"
400,4,9,His brother’s death; and then doth show
400,4,10,How with Calypso liv’d the sire
400,4,11,Of his young guest. The Wooers conspire
400,4,12,"Their prince’s death. Whose treach’ry known,"
400,4,13,Penelope in tears doth drown.
400,4,14,"Whom Pallas by a dream doth cheer,"
400,4,15,And in similitude appear
400,4,16,"Of fair Iphthima, known to be"
400,4,17,The sister of Penelope.

400,4,20,Here of the sire
400,4,21,The son doth hear.
400,4,22,The Wooers conspire.
400,4,23,The Mother’s fear.
400,4,24,"In Lacedæmon now, the nurse of whales,[1]"
400,4,25,"These two arriv’d, and found at festivals,"
400,4,26,"With mighty concourse, the renownéd king,"
400,4,27,His son and daughter jointly marrying.
400,4,28,"Alector’s daughter he did give his son,"
400,4,29,"Strong Megapenthes, who his life begun"
400,4,30,By Menelaus’ bondmaid; whom he knew
400,4,31,In years when Helen could no more renew
400,4,32,"In issue like divine Hermione,"
400,4,33,Who held in all fair form as high degree
400,4,34,As golden Venus. Her he married now
400,4,35,"To great Achilles’ son, who was by vow"
400,4,36,"Betroth’d to her at Troy, And thus the Gods"
400,4,37,To constant loves give nuptial periods.
400,4,38,"Whose state here past, the Myrmidons’ rich town"
400,4,39,(Of which she shar’d in the imperial crown)
400,4,40,With horse and chariots he resign’d her to.
400,4,41,"Mean space, the high huge house with feast did flow"
400,4,42,"Of friends and neighbours, joying with the king."
400,4,43,"Amongst whom did a heav’nly poet sing,"
400,4,44,And touch his harp. Amongst whom likewise danc’d
400,4,45,"Two, who in that dumb motion advanc’d,"
400,4,46,Would prompt the singer what to sing and play.[2]
400,4,47,"All this time in the utter court did stay,"
400,4,48,"With horse and chariot, Telemachus,"
400,4,49,And Nestor’s noble son Pisistratus.
400,4,50,"Whom Eteoneus, coming forth, descried,"
400,4,51,"And, being a servant to the king, most tried"
400,4,52,"In care and his respect, he ran and cried:"
400,4,53,"“Guests, Jove - kept Menelaus, two such men"
400,4,54,As are for form of high Saturnius’ strain.
400,4,55,"Inform your pleasure, if we shall unclose"
400,4,56,"Their horse from coach, or say they must dispose"
400,4,57,"Their way to some such house, as may embrace"
400,4,58,Their known arrival with more welcome grace?”
400,4,59,"He, angry, answer’d: “Thou didst never show"
400,4,60,"Thyself a fool, Boethides, till now;"
400,4,61,"But now, as if turn’d child, a childish speech"
400,4,62,Vents thy vain spirits. We ourselves now reach
400,4,63,Our home by much spent hospitality
400,4,64,Of other men; nor know if Jove will try
400,4,65,With other after - wants our state again;
400,4,66,And therefore from our feast no more detain
400,4,67,"Those welcome guests, but take their steeds from coach,"
400,4,68,And with attendance guide in their approach.”
400,4,69,"This said, he rush’d abroad, and call’d some more"
400,4,70,"Tried in such service, that together bore"
400,4,71,"Up to the guests, and took their steeds that swet"
400,4,72,"Beneath their yokes from coach; at mangers set,"
400,4,73,Wheat and white barley gave them mix’d; and plac’d
400,4,74,"Their chariot by a wall so clear, it cast"
400,4,75,A light quite through it. And then they led
400,4,76,Their guests to the divine house; which so fed
400,4,77,"Their eyes at all parts with illustrious sights,"
400,4,78,That admiration seiz’d them. Like the lights
400,4,79,"The sun and moon gave, all the palace threw"
400,4,80,"A lustre through it. Satiate with whose view,"
400,4,81,"Down to the king’s most bright - kept baths they went,"
400,4,82,"Where handmaids did their services present,"
400,4,83,"Bath’d, balm’d them, shirts and well - napt weeds put on,"
400,4,84,And by Atrides’ side set each his throne.
400,4,85,"Then did the handmaid - royal water bring,"
400,4,86,"And to a laver, rich and glittering,"
400,4,87,"Of massy gold, pour’d; which she plac’d upon"
400,4,88,"A silver caldron, into which might run"
400,4,89,The water as they wash’d. Then set she near
400,4,90,"A polish’d table, on which all the cheer"
400,4,91,"The present could afford a rev’rend dame,"
400,4,92,"That kept the larder, set. A cook then came,"
400,4,93,"And divers dishes, borne thence, serv’d again;"
400,4,94,"Furnish’d the board with bowls of gold. And then,"
400,4,95,"His right hand giv’n the guests, Atrides said:"
400,4,96,"“Eat, and be cheerful. Appetite allay’d,"
400,4,97,"I long to ask, of what stock ye descend;"
400,4,98,For not from parents whose race nameless end
400,4,99,We must derive your offspring. Men obscure
400,4,100,Could get none such as you. The portraiture
400,4,101,Of Jove - sustain’d and sceptre - bearing kings
400,4,102,Your either person in his presence brings.”
400,4,103,"An ox’s fat chine then they up did lift,"
400,4,104,"And set before the guests; which was a gift,"
400,4,105,Sent as an honour to the king’s own taste.
400,4,106,"They saw yet ’twas but to be eaten plac’d,"
400,4,107,"And fell to it. But food and wine’s care past,"
400,4,108,"Telemachus thus prompted Nestor’s son,"
400,4,109,"(His ear close laying, to be heard of none):[3]"
400,4,110,"“Consider, thou whom most of my mind esteems,"
400,4,111,"The brass - work here, how rich it is in beams,"
400,4,112,"And how, besides, it makes the whole house sound;"
400,4,113,"What gold, and amber, silver, ivory, round"
400,4,114,"Is wrought about it. Out of doubt, the hall"
400,4,115,Of Jupiter Olympius hath of all
400,4,116,This state the like. How many infinites
400,4,117,Take up to admiration all men’s sights!”
400,4,118,"Atrides over - heard, and said: “Lov’d son,"
400,4,119,No mortal must affect contentión
400,4,120,"With Jove, whose dwellings are of endless date."
400,4,121,"Perhaps of men some one may emulate,"
400,4,122,"Or none, my house, or me; for I am one"
400,4,123,"That many a grave extreme have undergone,"
400,4,124,"Much error felt by sea, and till th’ eighth year,"
400,4,125,"Had never stay, but wander’d far and near,"
400,4,126,"Cyprus, Phœnicia, and Sidonia,"
400,4,127,"And fetch’d the far - off Æthiopia,"
400,4,128,"Reach’d the Erembi of Arabia,"
400,4,129,"And Lybia, where with horns ewes yean their lambs,"
400,4,130,"Which ev’ry full year ewes are three times dams,"
400,4,131,"Where neither king, nor shepherd, want comes near"
400,4,132,"Of cheese, or flesh, or sweet milk; all the year"
400,4,133,They ever milk their ewes. And here while I
400,4,134,"Err’d, gath’ring means to live, one, murd’rously,"
400,4,135,"Unwares, unseen, bereft my brother’s life,"
400,4,136,Chiefly betray’d by his abhorréd wife.
400,4,137,"So hold I, not enjoying, what you see."
400,4,138,"And of your fathers, if they living be,"
400,4,139,"You must have heard this, since my suff’rings were"
400,4,140,So great and famous; from this palace here
400,4,141,"(So rarely - well - built, furnishéd so well,"
400,4,142,And substancéd with such a precious deal
400,4,143,Of well - got treasure) banish’d by the doom
400,4,144,"Of Fate, and erring as I had no home."
400,4,145,"And now I have, and use it, not to take"
400,4,146,"Th’ entire delight it offers, but to make"
400,4,147,"Continual wishes, that a triple part"
400,4,148,"Of all it holds were wanting, so my heart"
400,4,149,"Were eas’d of sorrows, taken for their deaths"
400,4,150,"That fell at Troy, by their revivéd breaths."
400,4,151,"And thus sit I here weeping, mourning still"
400,4,152,"Each least man lost; and sometimes make mine ill,"
400,4,153,"In paying just tears for their loss, my joy."
400,4,154,"Sometimes I breathe my woes, for in annoy"
400,4,155,The pleasure soon admits satiety.
400,4,156,"But all these men’s wants wet not so mine eye,"
400,4,157,"Though much they move me, as one sole man’s miss,"
400,4,158,For which my sleep and meat ev’n loathsome is
400,4,159,"In his renew’d thought, since no Greek hath won"
400,4,160,Grace for such labours as Laërtes’ son
400,4,161,"Hath wrought and suffer’d, to himself nought else"
400,4,162,"But future sorrows forging, to me hells"
400,4,163,"For his long absence, since I cannot know"
400,4,164,If life or death detain him; since such woe
400,4,165,"For his love, old Laërtes, his wise wife,"
400,4,166,"And poor young son sustains, whom new with life"
400,4,167,He left as sireless.” This speech grief to tears
400,4,168,"(Pour’d from the son’s lids on the earth) his ears,"
400,4,169,"Told of the father, did excite; who kept"
400,4,170,"His cheeks dry with his red weed as he wept,"
400,4,171,His both hands us’d therein. Atrides then
400,4,172,"Began to know him, and did strife retain,"
400,4,173,"If he should let himself confess his sire,"
400,4,174,Or with all fitting circumstance enquire.
400,4,175,"While this his thoughts disputed, forth did shine,"
400,4,176,"Like to the golden distaff - deck’d Divine,"
400,4,177,"From her bed’s high and odoriferous room,"
400,4,178,"Helen. To whom, of an elaborate loom,"
400,4,179,Adresta set a chair; Alcippe brought
400,4,180,A piece of tapestry of fine wool wrought;
400,4,181,"Phylo a silver cabinet conferr’d,"
400,4,182,"Giv’n by Alcandra, nuptially endear’d"
400,4,183,"To lord Polybius, whose abode in Thebes"
400,4,184,"Th’ Ægyptian city was, where wealth in heaps"
400,4,185,"His famous house held, out of which did go,"
400,4,186,"In gift t’ Atrides, silver bath - tubs two,"
400,4,187,"Two tripods, and of fine gold talents ten."
400,4,188,His wife did likewise send to Helen then
400,4,189,"Fair gifts, a distaff that of gold was wrought,"
400,4,190,"And that rich cabinet that Phylo brought,"
400,4,191,"Round, and with gold ribb’d, now of fine thread full;"
400,4,192,"On which extended (crown‘d with finest wool,"
400,4,193,Of violet gloss) the golden distaff - lay.
400,4,194,"She took her state - chair, and a foot - stool’s stay"
400,4,195,Had for her feet; and of her husband thus
400,4,196,"Ask’d to know all things: “Is it known to us,"
400,4,197,"King Menelaus, whom these men commend"
400,4,198,"Themselves for, that our court now takes to friend?"
400,4,199,"I must affirm, be I deceiv’d or no,"
400,4,200,I never yet saw man nor woman so
400,4,201,"Like one another, as this man is like"
400,4,202,Ulysses’ son. With admiration strike
400,4,203,"His looks my thoughts, that they should carry now"
400,4,204,"Pow’r to persuade me thus, who did but know,"
400,4,205,"When newly he was born, the form they bore."
400,4,206,"But ’tis his father’s grace, whom more and more"
400,4,207,"His grace resembles, that makes me retain"
400,4,208,"Thought that he now is like Telemachus, then"
400,4,209,"Left by his sire, when Greece did undertake"
400,4,210,Troy’s bold war for my impudency’s sake.”
400,4,211,"He answer’d: “Now wife, what you think I know,"
400,4,212,The true cast of his father’s eye doth show
400,4,213,"In his eyes’ order. Both his head and hair,"
400,4,214,"His hands and feet, his very father’s are."
400,4,215,"Of whom, so well remember’d, I should now"
400,4,216,Acknowledge for me his continual flow
400,4,217,"Of cares and perils, yet still patient."
400,4,218,"But I should too much move him, that doth vent"
400,4,219,"Such bitter tears for that which hath been spoke,"
400,4,220,"Which, shunning soft show, see how he would cloak,"
400,4,221,And with his purple weed his weepings hide.”
400,4,222,"Then Nestor’s son, Pisistratus, replied:"
400,4,223,"“Great pastor of the people, kept of God!"
400,4,224,"He is Ulysses’ son, but his abode"
400,4,225,"Not made before here, and he modest too,"
400,4,226,He holds it an indignity to do
400,4,227,"A deed so vain, to use the boast of words,"
400,4,228,Where your words are on wing; whose voice affords
400,4,229,Delight to us as if a God did break
400,4,230,"The air amongst us, and vouchsafe to speak."
400,4,231,"But me my father, old duke Nestor, sent"
400,4,232,To be his consort hither; his content
400,4,233,"Not to be heighten’d so as with your sight,"
400,4,234,In hope that therewith words and actions might
400,4,235,"Inform his comforts from you, since he is"
400,4,236,Extremely griev’d and injur’d by the miss
400,4,237,"Of his great father; suff’ring ev’n at home,"
400,4,238,And few friends found to help him overcome
400,4,239,"His too weak suff’rance, now his sire is gone;"
400,4,240,"Amongst the people, not afforded one"
400,4,241,To check the miseries that mate him thus.
400,4,242,And this the state is of Telemachus.”
400,4,243,"“O Gods,” said he, “how certain, now, I see"
400,4,244,"My house enjoys that friend’s son, that for me"
400,4,245,Hath undergone so many willing fights!
400,4,246,"Whom I resolv’d, past all the Grecian knights,"
400,4,247,"To hold in love, if our return by seas"
400,4,248,The far - off Thunderer did ever please
400,4,249,To grant our wishes. And to his respect
400,4,250,"A palace and a city to erect,"
400,4,251,My vow had bound me; whither bringing then
400,4,252,"His riches, and his son, and all his men,"
400,4,253,"From barren Ithaca, (some one sole town"
400,4,254,Inhabited about him batter’d down)
400,4,255,All should in Argos live. And there would I
400,4,256,"Ease him of rule, and take the empery"
400,4,257,"Of all on me. And often here would we,"
400,4,258,"Delighting, loving either’s company,"
400,4,259,"Meet and converse; whom nothing should divide,"
400,4,260,Till death’s black veil did each all over hide.
400,4,261,But this perhaps hath been a mean to take
400,4,262,Ev’n God himself with envy; who did make
400,4,263,"Ulysses therefore only the unblest,"
400,4,264,That should not reach his loved country’s rest.”
400,4,265,These woes made ev’ry one with woe in love;
400,4,266,"Ev’n Argive Helen wept, the Seed of Jove;"
400,4,267,Ulysses’ son wept; Atreus’ son did weep;
400,4,268,"And Nestor’s son his eyes in tears did steep,"
400,4,269,But his tears fell not from the present cloud
400,4,270,"That from Ulysses was exhal’d, but flow’d"
400,4,271,"From brave Antilochus’ remember’d due,"
400,4,272,"Whom the renown’d Son of the Morning slew,"
400,4,273,Which yet he thus excus’d: “O Atreus’ son!
400,4,274,"Old Nestor says, there lives not such a one"
400,4,275,Amongst all mortals as Atrides is
400,4,276,"For deathless wisdom. ’Tis a praise of his,"
400,4,277,"Still giv’n in your remembrance, when at home"
400,4,278,Our speech concerns you. Since then overcome
400,4,279,"You please to be with sorrow, ev’n to tears,"
400,4,280,"That are in wisdom so exempt from peers,"
400,4,281,"Vouchsafe the like effect in me excuse,"
400,4,282,"If it be lawful, I affect no use"
400,4,283,"Of tears thus after meals; at least, at night;"
400,4,284,"But when the morn brings forth, with tears, her light,"
400,4,285,It shall not then impair me to bestow
400,4,286,My tears on any worthy’s overthrow.
400,4,287,It is the only rite that wretched men
400,4,288,"Can do dead friends, to cut hair, and complain."
400,4,289,"But Death my brother took, whom none could call"
400,4,290,"The Grecian coward, you best knew of all."
400,4,291,"I was not there, nor saw, but men report"
400,4,292,Antilochus excell’d the common sort
400,4,293,"For footmanship, or for the chariot race,"
400,4,294,Or in the fight for hardy hold of place.”
400,4,295,"“O friend,” said he, “since thou hast spoken so,"
400,4,296,"At all parts as one wise should say and do,"
400,4,297,"And like one far beyond thyself in years,"
400,4,298,Thy words shall bounds be to our former tears.
400,4,299,"O he is questionless a right - born son,"
400,4,300,That of his father hath not only won
400,4,301,The person but the wisdom; and that sire
400,4,302,"Complete himself that hath a son entire,"
400,4,303,"Jove did not only his full fate adorn,"
400,4,304,"When he was wedded, but when he was born."
400,4,305,"As now Saturnius, through his life’s whole date,"
400,4,306,"Hath Nestor’s bliss rais’d to as steep a state,"
400,4,307,"Both in his age to keep in peace his house,"
400,4,308,And to have children wise and valorous.
400,4,309,But let us not forget our rear feast thus.
400,4,310,Let some give water here. Telemachus!
400,4,311,The morning shall yield time to you and me
400,4,312,"To do what fits, and reason mutually.”"
400,4,313,"This said, the careful servant of the king,"
400,4,314,"Asphalion, pour’d on th’ issue of the spring;"
400,4,315,And all to ready feast set ready hand.
400,4,316,"But Helen now on new device did stand,"
400,4,317,"Infusing straight a medicine to their wine,"
400,4,318,"That, drowning care and angers; did decline"
400,4,319,All thought of ill. Who drunk her cup could shed
400,4,320,"All that day not a tear, no not if dead"
400,4,321,"That day his father or his mother were,"
400,4,322,"Not if his brother, child, or chiefest dear,"
400,4,323,He should see murder’d then before his face.
400,4,324,"Such useful medicines, only borne in grace"
400,4,325,"Of what was good, would Helen ever have."
400,4,326,And this juice to her Polydamna gave
400,4,327,"The wife of Thoon, an Ægyptian born,"
400,4,328,Whose rich earth herbs of medicine do adorn
400,4,329,"In great abundance. Many healthful are,"
400,4,330,And many baneful. Ev’ry man is there
400,4,331,"A good physician out of Nature’s grace,"
400,4,332,For all the nation sprung of Pæon’s race.
400,4,333,"When Helen then her medicine had infus’d,"
400,4,334,"She bad pour wine to it, and this speech us’d:"
400,4,335,"“Atrides, and these good men’s sons, great Jove"
400,4,336,"Makes good and ill one after other move,"
400,4,337,In all things earthly; for he can do all.
400,4,338,"The woes past, therefore, he so late let fall,"
400,4,339,The comforts he affords us let us take;
400,4,340,"Feast, and, with fit discourses, merry make."
400,4,341,Nor will I other use. As then our blood
400,4,342,"Griev’d for Ulysses, since he was so good,"
400,4,343,"Since he was good, let us delight to hear"
400,4,344,"How good he was, and what his suff’rings were;"
400,4,345,"Though ev’ry fight, and ev’ry suff’ring deed,"
400,4,346,"Patient Ulysses underwent, exceed"
400,4,347,"My woman’s pow’r to number, or to name."
400,4,348,"But what he did, and suffer’d, when he came"
400,4,349,"Amongst the Trojans, where ye Grecians all"
400,4,350,"Took part with suff’rance, I in part can call"
400,4,351,To your kind memories. How with ghastly wounds
400,4,352,"Himself he mangled, and the Trojan bounds,"
400,4,353,"Thrust thick with enemies, adventur’d on,"
400,4,354,His royal shoulders having cast upon
400,4,355,"Base abject weeds, and enter’d like a slave."
400,4,356,"Then, beggar - like, he did of all men crave,"
400,4,357,"And such a wretch was, as the whole Greek fleet"
400,4,358,Brought not besides. And thus through ev’ry street
400,4,359,"He crept discov’ring, of no one man known."
400,4,360,"And yet through all this diff’rence, I alone"
400,4,361,"Smoked his true person, talk’d with him; but he"
400,4,362,"Fled me with wiles still. Nor could we agree,"
400,4,363,Till I disclaim’d him quite; and so (as mov’d
400,4,364,With womanly remorse of one that prov’d
400,4,365,"So wretched an estate, whate’er he were)"
400,4,366,"Won him to take my house. And yet ev’n there,"
400,4,367,"Till freely I, to make him doubtless, swore"
400,4,368,"A pow’rful oath, to let him reach the shore"
400,4,369,"Of ships and tents before Troy understood,"
400,4,370,I could not force on him his proper good.
400,4,371,"But then I bath’d and sooth’d him, and he then"
400,4,372,"Confess’d, and told me all; and, having slain"
400,4,373,"A number of the Trojan guards, retir’d,"
400,4,374,"And reach’d the fleet, for sleight and force admir’d."
400,4,375,Their husbands’ deaths by him the Trojan wives
400,4,376,"Shriek’d for; but I made triumphs for their lives,"
400,4,377,"For then my heart conceiv’d, that once again"
400,4,378,I should reach home; and yet did still retain
400,4,379,"Woe for the slaughters Venus made for me,"
400,4,380,"When both my husband, my Hermione,"
400,4,381,"And bridal room, she robb’d of so much right,"
400,4,382,"And drew me from my country with her sleight,"
400,4,383,"Though nothing under heaven I here did need,"
400,4,384,That could my fancy or my beauty feed.”
400,4,385,Her husband said: “Wife! what you please to tell
400,4,386,"Is true at all parts, and becomes you well;"
400,4,387,"And I myself, that now may say have seen"
400,4,388,"The minds and manners of a world of men,"
400,4,389,"And great heroes, measuring many a ground,"
400,4,390,"Have never, by these eyes that light me, found"
400,4,391,"One with a bosom so to be belov’d,"
400,4,392,As that in which th’ accomplish’d spirit mov’d
400,4,393,"Of patient Ulysses. What, brave man,"
400,4,394,"He both did act, and suffer, when he wan"
400,4,395,"The town of Ilion, in the brave - built horse,"
400,4,396,When all we chief states of the Grecian force
400,4,397,"Were hous’d together, bringing death and Fate"
400,4,398,"Amongst the Trojans, you, wife, may relate;"
400,4,399,"For you, at last, came to us; God, that would"
400,4,400,"The Trojans’ glory give, gave charge you should"
400,4,401,"Approach the engine; and Deiphobus,"
400,4,402,"The god - like, follow’d. Thrice ye circled us"
400,4,403,With full survey of it; and often tried
400,4,404,The hollow crafts that in it were implied.[4]
400,4,405,When all the voices of their wives in it
400,4,406,"You took on you with voice so like and fit,"
400,4,407,"And ev’ry man by name so visited,"
400,4,408,"That I, Ulysses, the king Diomed,"
400,4,409,"(Set in the midst, and hearing how you call’d)"
400,4,410,"Tydides, and myself (as half appall’d"
400,4,411,With your remorseful plaints) would passing fain
400,4,412,"Have broke our silence, rather than again"
400,4,413,"Endure, respectless, their so moving cries."
400,4,414,But Ithacus our strongest phantasies
400,4,415,"Contain’d within us from the slenderest noise,"
400,4,416,And ev’ry man there sat without a voice.
400,4,417,"Anticlus only would have answer’d thee,"
400,4,418,But his speech Ithacus incessantly
400,4,419,"With strong hand held in, till, Minerva’s call"
400,4,420,"Charging thee off, Ulysses sav’d us all.”"
400,4,421,Telemachus replied: “Much greater is
400,4,422,"My grief, for hearing this high praise of his."
400,4,423,"For all this doth not his sad death divert,"
400,4,424,"Nor can, though in him swell’d an iron heart."
400,4,425,"Prepare, and lead then, if you please, to rest:"
400,4,426,"Sleep, that we hear not, will content us best.”"
400,4,427,"Then Argive Helen made her handmaid go,"
400,4,428,"And put fair bedding in the portico,"
400,4,429,"Lay purple blankets on, rugs warm and soft,"
400,4,430,And cast an arras coverlet aloft.
400,4,431,"They torches took, made haste, and made the bed;"
400,4,432,When both the guests were to their lodgings led
400,4,433,Within a portico without the house.
400,4,434,"Atrides, and his large - train - wearing spouse,"
400,4,435,"The excellent of women, for the way,"
400,4,436,"In a retir’d receit, together lay."
400,4,437,"The Morn arose; the king rose, and put on"
400,4,438,"His royal weeds, his sharp sword hung upon"
400,4,439,"His ample shoulders, forth his chamber went,"
400,4,440,And did the person of a God present.
400,4,441,"Telemachus accosts him, who begun"
400,4,442,Speech of his journey’s proposition:
400,4,443,"“And what, my young Ulyssean heroë,"
400,4,444,"Provok’d thee on the broad back of the sea,"
400,4,445,To visit Lacedæmon the divine?
400,4,446,"Speak truth, some public [good] or only thine?”"
400,4,447,"“I come,” said he, “to hear, if any fame"
400,4,448,Breath’d of my father to thy notice came.
400,4,449,"My house is sack’d, my fat works of the field"
400,4,450,Are all destroy’d; my house doth nothing yield
400,4,451,"But enemies, that kill my harmless sheep,"
400,4,452,"And sinewy oxen, nor will ever keep"
400,4,453,Their steels without them. And these men are they
400,4,454,"That woo my mother, most inhumanly"
400,4,455,Committing injury on injury.
400,4,456,"To thy knees therefore I am come, t’ attend"
400,4,457,Relation of the sad and wretched end
400,4,458,"My erring father felt, if witness’d by"
400,4,459,"Your own eyes, or the certain news that fly"
400,4,460,"From others’ knowledges. For, more than is"
400,4,461,"The usual heap of human miseries,"
400,4,462,"His mother bore him to. Vouchsafe me then,"
400,4,463,"Without all ruth of what I can sustain,"
400,4,464,The plain and simple truth of all you know.
400,4,465,"Let me beseech so much, if ever vow"
400,4,466,"Was made, and put in good effect to you,"
400,4,467,"At Troy, where suff’rance bred you so much smart,"
400,4,468,"Upon my father good Ulysses’ part,"
400,4,469,And quit it now to me (himself in youth)
400,4,470,Unfolding only the uncloséd truth.”
400,4,471,"He, deeply sighing, answer’d him: “O shame,"
400,4,472,That such poor vassals should affect the fame
400,4,473,To share the joys of such a worthy’s bed!
400,4,474,"As when a hind, her calves late farrowéd,"
400,4,475,"To give suck, enters the bold lion’s den,"
400,4,476,He roots of hills and herby vallies then
400,4,477,For food (there feeding) hunting; but at length
400,4,478,"Returning to his cavern, gives his strength"
400,4,479,The lives of both the mother and her brood
400,4,480,In deaths indecent; so the Wooers’ blood
400,4,481,Must pay Ulysses’ pow’rs as sharp an end.
400,4,482,"O would to Jove, Apollo, and thy friend"
400,4,483,"The wise Minerva, that thy father were"
400,4,484,"As once he was, when he his spirits did rear"
400,4,485,"Against Philomelides, in a fight"
400,4,486,"Perform’d in well - built Lesbos, where, down - right"
400,4,487,"He strook the earth with him, and gat a shout"
400,4,488,"Of all the Grecians! O, if now full out"
400,4,489,"He were as then, and with the Wooers coped,"
400,4,490,"Short - liv’d they all were, and their nuptials hoped"
400,4,491,"Would prove as desp’rate. But, for thy demand"
400,4,492,"Enforc’d with pray’rs, I’ll let thee understand"
400,4,493,"The truth directly, nor decline a thought,"
400,4,494,"Much less deceive, or sooth thy search in ought;"
400,4,495,"But what the old and still - true - spoken God,"
400,4,496,"That from the sea breathes oracles abroad,"
400,4,497,"Disclos’d to me, to thee I’ll all impart,"
400,4,498,Nor hide one word from thy sollicitous heart.
400,4,499,"I was in Ægypt, where a mighty time"
400,4,500,"The Gods detain’d me, though my natural clime"
400,4,501,"I never so desir’d, because their homes"
400,4,502,I did not greet with perfect hecatombs.
400,4,503,"For they will put men evermore in mind,"
400,4,504,How much their masterly commandments bind.
400,4,505,"There is, besides, a certain island, call’d"
400,4,506,"Pharos, that with the high - wav’d sea is wall’d,"
400,4,507,"Just against Ægypt, and so much remote,"
400,4,508,"As in a whole day, with a fore - gale smote,"
400,4,509,A hollow ship can sail. And this isle bears
400,4,510,"A port most portly, where sea - passengers"
400,4,511,"Put in still for fresh water, and away"
400,4,512,To sea again. Yet here the Gods did stay
400,4,513,"My fleet full twenty days; the winds, that are"
400,4,514,"Masters at sea, no prosp’rous puff would spare"
400,4,515,To put us off; and all my victuals here
400,4,516,"Had quite corrupted, as my men’s minds were,"
400,4,517,"Had not a certain Goddess giv’n regard,"
400,4,518,And pitied me in an estate so hard;
400,4,519,"And ’twas Idothea, honour’d Proteus’ seed,"
400,4,520,That old sea - farer. Her mind I make bleed
400,4,521,"With my compassion, when (walk’d all alone,"
400,4,522,"From all my soldiers, that were ever gone"
400,4,523,About the isle on fishing with hooks bent;
400,4,524,Hunger their bellies on her errand sent)
400,4,525,"She came close to me, spake, and thus began:"
400,4,526,‘Of all men thou art the most foolish man!
400,4,527,"Or slack in business, or stay’st here of choice,"
400,4,528,"And dost in all thy suff’rances rejoice,"
400,4,529,"That thus long liv’st detain’d here, and no end"
400,4,530,Canst give thy tarriance? Thou dost much offend
400,4,531,The minds of all thy fellows.’ I replied:
400,4,532,"‘Whoever thou art of the Deified,"
400,4,533,"I must affirm, that no way with my will"
400,4,534,"I make abode here; but, it seems, some ill"
400,4,535,"The Gods, inhabiting broad heav’n, sustain"
400,4,536,"Against my getting off. Inform me then,"
400,4,537,"For Godheads all things know, what God is he"
400,4,538,That stays my passage from the fishy sea?’
400,4,539,"‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘I’ll tell thee true: There lives"
400,4,540,"An old sea - farer in these seas, that gives"
400,4,541,"A true solution of all secrets here,"
400,4,542,"Who deathless Proteus is, th’ Ægyptian peer,"
400,4,543,"Who can the deeps of all the seas exquire,"
400,4,544,"Who Neptune’s priest is, and, they say, the sire"
400,4,545,"That did beget me. Him, if any way"
400,4,546,"Thou couldst inveigle, he would clear display"
400,4,547,"Thy course from hence, and how far off doth lie"
400,4,548,Thy voyage’s whole scope through Neptune’s sky.
400,4,549,"Informing thee, O God - preserv’d, beside,"
400,4,550,"If thy desires would so be satisfied,"
400,4,551,"Whatever good or ill hath got event,"
400,4,552,"In all the time thy long and hard course spent,"
400,4,553,Since thy departure from thy house.’ This said;
400,4,554,Again I answer’d: ‘Make the sleights display’d
400,4,555,"Thy father useth, lest his foresight see,"
400,4,556,"Or his foreknowledge taking note of me,"
400,4,557,He flies the fixt place of his us’d abode.
400,4,558,’Tis hard for man to countermine with God.’
400,4,559,She straight replied: ‘I’ll utter truth in all:
400,4,560,"When heav’n’s supremest height the sun doth skall,"
400,4,561,"The old Sea - tell - truth leaves the deeps, and hides"
400,4,562,"Amidst a black storm, when the West Wind chides,"
400,4,563,In caves still sleeping. Round about him sleep
400,4,564,(With short feet swimming forth the foamy deep)
400,4,565,"The sea - calves, lovely Halosydnes call’d,"
400,4,566,"From whom a noisome odour is exhal’d,"
400,4,567,"Got from the whirl - pools, on whose earth they lie."
400,4,568,"Here, when the morn illustrates all the sky,"
400,4,569,"I’ll guide, and seat thee in the fittest place"
400,4,570,For the performance thou hast now in chace.
400,4,571,"In mean time, reach thy fleet, and choose out three"
400,4,572,"Of best exploit, to go as aids to thee."
400,4,573,But now I’ll show thee all the old God’s sleights:
400,4,574,"He first will number, and take all the sights"
400,4,575,"Of those his guard, that on the shore arrives."
400,4,576,"When having view’d, and told them forth by fives,"
400,4,577,"He takes place in their midst, and there doth sleep,"
400,4,578,Like to a shepherd midst his flock of sheep.
400,4,579,"In his first sleep, call up your hardiest cheer,"
400,4,580,"Vigour and violence, and hold him there,"
400,4,581,In spite of all his strivings to be gone.
400,4,582,He then will turn himself to ev’ry one
400,4,583,"Of all things that in earth creep and respire,"
400,4,584,"In water swim, or shine in heav’nly fire."
400,4,585,"Yet still hold you him firm, and much the more"
400,4,586,"Press him from passing. But when, as before,"
400,4,587,"When sleep first bound his pow’rs, his form ye see,"
400,4,588,"Then cease your force, and th’ old heroë free,"
400,4,589,"And then demand, which heav’n - born it may be"
400,4,590,"That so afflicts you, hind’ring your retreat,"
400,4,591,And free sea - passage to your native seat.’
400,4,592,"This said, she div’d into the wavy seas,"
400,4,593,"And I my course did to my ships address,"
400,4,594,"That on the sands stuck; where arriv’d, we made"
400,4,595,Our supper ready. Then th’ ambrosian shade
400,4,596,"Of night fell on us, and to sleep we fell."
400,4,597,"Rosy Aurora rose; we rose as well,"
400,4,598,"And three of them on whom I most relied,"
400,4,599,"For firm at ev’ry force, I choos’d, and hied"
400,4,600,Straight to the many - river - servéd seas;
400,4,601,And all assistance ask’d the Deities.
400,4,602,Mean time Idothea the sea’s broad breast
400,4,603,"Embrac’d, and brought for me, and all my rest,"
400,4,604,"Four of the sea - calves’ skins but newly flay’d,"
400,4,605,To work a wile which she had fashionéd
400,4,606,"Upon her father. Then, within the sand"
400,4,607,"A covert digging, when these calves should land,"
400,4,608,She sat expecting. We came close to her;
400,4,609,"She plac’d us orderly, and made us wear"
400,4,610,Each one his calf’s skin. But we then must pass
400,4,611,A huge exploit. The sea - calves’ savour was
400,4,612,"So passing sour, they still being bred at seas,"
400,4,613,It much afflicted us; for who can please
400,4,614,To lie by one of these same sea - bred whales?
400,4,615,"But she preserves us, and to memory calls"
400,4,616,A rare commodity; she fetch’d to us
400,4,617,"Ambrosia, that an air most odorous"
400,4,618,"Bears still about it, which she ‘nointed round"
400,4,619,"Our either nosthrils, and in it quite drown’d"
400,4,620,The nasty whale - smell. Then the great event
400,4,621,"The whole morn’s date, with spirits patient,"
400,4,622,"We lay expecting. When bright noon did flame,"
400,4,623,"Forth from the sea in shoals the sea - calves came,"
400,4,624,"And orderly, at last lay down and slept"
400,4,625,Along the sands. And then th’ old Sea - God crept
400,4,626,"From forth the deeps, and found his fat calves there,"
400,4,627,"Survey’d, and number’d, and came never near"
400,4,628,"The craft we us’d, but told us five for calves."
400,4,629,His temples then dis - eas’d with sleep he salves;
400,4,630,"And in rush’d we, with an abhorréd cry,"
400,4,631,Cast all our hands about him manfully;
400,4,632,And then th’ old Forger all his forms began:
400,4,633,"First was a lion with a mighty mane,"
400,4,634,"Then next a dragon, a pied panther then,"
400,4,635,"A vast boar next, and suddenly did strain"
400,4,636,"All into water. Last he was a tree,"
400,4,637,"Curl’d all at top, and shot up to the sky."
400,4,638,"We, with resolv’d hearts, held him firmly still,"
400,4,639,When th’ old one (held too strait for all his skill
400,4,640,"To extricate) gave words, and question’d me:"
400,4,641,"“Which of the Gods, O Atreus’ son,’ said he,"
400,4,642,"‘Advis’d and taught thy fortitude this sleight,"
400,4,643,To take and hold me thus in my despite?’
400,4,644,‘What asks thy wish now?’ I replied. ‘Thou know’st.
400,4,645,Why dost thou ask? What wiles are these thou show’st?
400,4,646,I have within this isle been held for wind
400,4,647,"A wondrous time, and can by no means find"
400,4,648,An end to my retention. It hath spent
400,4,649,The very heart in me. Give thou then vent
400,4,650,"To doubts thus bound in me, ye Gods know all,"
400,4,651,Which of the Godheads doth so foully fall
400,4,652,"On my addression home, to stay me here,"
400,4,653,"Avert me from my way, the fishy clear"
400,4,654,"Barr’d to my passage?’ He replied: ‘Of force,"
400,4,655,"If to thy home thou wishest free recourse,"
400,4,656,"To Jove, and all the other Deities,"
400,4,657,Thou must exhibit solemn sacrifice;
400,4,658,"And then the black sea for thee shall be clear,"
400,4,659,Till thy lov’d country’s settled reach. But where
400,4,660,Ask these rites thy performance? ’Tis a fate
400,4,661,"To thee and thy affairs appropriate,"
400,4,662,"That thou shalt never see thy friends, nor tread"
400,4,663,"Thy country’s earth, nor see inhabited"
400,4,664,"Thy so magnificent house, till thou make good"
400,4,665,"Thy voyage back to the Ægyptian flood,"
400,4,666,"Whose waters fell from Jove, and there hast giv’n"
400,4,667,"To Jove, and all Gods housed in ample heav’n,"
400,4,668,"Devoted hecatombs, and then free ways"
400,4,669,"Shall open to thee, clear’d of all delays.’"
400,4,670,"This told he; and, methought, he brake my heart,"
400,4,671,In such a long and hard course to divert
400,4,672,"My hope for home, and charge my back retreat"
400,4,673,As far as Ægypt. I made answer yet:
400,4,674,"‘Father, thy charge I’ll perfect; but before"
400,4,675,"Resolve me truly, if their natural shore"
400,4,676,"All those Greeks, and their ships, do safe enjoy,"
400,4,677,"That Nestor and myself left, when from Troy"
400,4,678,We first rais’d sail? Or whether any died
400,4,679,"At sea a death unwish’d? Or, satisfied,"
400,4,680,"When war was past, by friends embrac’d, in peace"
400,4,681,Resign’d their spirits? He made answer: ‘Cease
400,4,682,To ask so far. It fits thee not to be
400,4,683,So cunning in thine own calamity.
400,4,684,Nor seek to learn what learn’d thou shouldst forget.
400,4,685,"Men’s knowledges have proper limits set,"
400,4,686,And should not prease into the mind of God.
400,4,687,"But ’twill not long be, as my thoughts abode,"
400,4,688,Before thou buy this curious skill with tears.
400,4,689,"Many of those, whose states so tempt thine ears,"
400,4,690,"Are stoop’d by death, and many left alive,"
400,4,691,"One chief of which in strong hold doth survive,"
400,4,692,"Amidst the broad sea. Two, in their retreat,"
400,4,693,Are done to death. I list not to repeat
400,4,694,"Who fell at Troy, thyself was there in fight,"
400,4,695,"But in return swift Ajax lost the light,"
400,4,696,"In his long - oar’d ship. Neptune, yet, awhile"
400,4,697,"Saft him unwrack’d, to the Gyræan isle,"
400,4,698,A mighty - rock removing from his way.
400,4,699,"And surely he had ‘scap’d the fatal day,"
400,4,700,"In spite of Pallas, if to that foul deed"
400,4,701,"He in her fane did, (when he ravishéd"
400,4,702,The Trojan prophetess) he had not here
400,4,703,"Adjoin’d an impious boast, that he would bear,"
400,4,704,"Despite the Gods, his ship safe through the waves"
400,4,705,Then rais’d against him. These his impious braves
400,4,706,"When Neptune heard, in his strong hand he took"
400,4,707,"His massy trident, and so soundly strook"
400,4,708,"The rock Gyræan, that in two it cleft;"
400,4,709,"Of which one fragment on the land he left,"
400,4,710,The other fell into the troubled seas;
400,4,711,"At which first rush’d Ajax Oïliades,"
400,4,712,"And split his ship, and then himself afloat"
400,4,713,"Swum on the rough waves of the world’s vast mote,"
400,4,714,"Till having drunk a salt cup for his sin,"
400,4,715,There perish’d he. Thy brother yet did win
400,4,716,"The wreath from death, while in the waves they strove,"
400,4,717,Afflicted by the rev’rend wife of Jove.
400,4,718,But when the steep mount of the Malian shore
400,4,719,"He seem’d to reach, a most tempestuous blore,"
400,4,720,"Far to the fishy world that sighs so sore,"
400,4,721,"Straight ravish’d him again as far away,"
400,4,722,"As to th’ extreme bounds where the Agrians stay,"
400,4,723,"Where first Thyestes dwelt, but then his son"
400,4,724,"Ægisthus Thyestiades liv’d. This done,"
400,4,725,"When his return untouch’d appear’d again,"
400,4,726,"Back turn’d the Gods the wind, and set him then"
400,4,727,"Hard by his house. Then, full of joy, he left"
400,4,728,"His ship, and close t’ his country earth he cleft,"
400,4,729,"Kiss’d it, and wept for joy, pour’d tear on tear,"
400,4,730,To set so wishedly his footing there.
400,4,731,"But see, a sentinel that all the year"
400,4,732,Crafty Ægisthus in a watchtow’r set
400,4,733,"To spy his landing, for reward as great"
400,4,734,"As two gold talents, all his pow’rs did call"
400,4,735,"To strict remembrance of his charge, and all"
400,4,736,"Discharg’d at first sight, which at first he cast"
400,4,737,"On Agamemnon, and with all his haste"
400,4,738,Inform’d Ægisthus. He an instant train
400,4,739,Laid for his slaughter: Twenty chosen men
400,4,740,Of his plebeians he in ambush laid;
400,4,741,His other men he charg’d to see purvey’d
400,4,742,"A feast; and forth, with horse and chariots grac’d,"
400,4,743,"He rode t’ invite him, but in heart embrac’d"
400,4,744,"Horrible welcomes, and to death did bring,"
400,4,745,"With treach’rous slaughter, the unwary king,"
400,4,746,"Receiv’d him at a feast, and, like an ox"
400,4,747,"Slain at his manger, gave him bits and knocks."
400,4,748,"No one left of Atrides’ train, nor one"
400,4,749,"Sav’d to Ægisthus, but himself alone,"
400,4,750,All strew’d together there the bloody court.’
400,4,751,"This said, my soul he sunk with his report,"
400,4,752,"Flat on the sands I fell, tears spent their store,"
400,4,753,"I light abhorr’d, my heart would live no more."
400,4,754,"When dry of tears, and tir’d of tumbling there,"
400,4,755,Th’ old Tell - truth thus my daunted spirits did cheer:
400,4,756,"‘No more spend tears nor time, O Atreus’ son,"
400,4,757,"With ceaseless weeping never wish was won,"
400,4,758,"Use uttermost assay to reach thy home,"
400,4,759,"And all unwares upon the murderer come,"
400,4,760,"For torture, taking him thyself alive;"
400,4,761,"Or let Orestes, that should far out - strive"
400,4,762,"Thee in fit vengeance, quickly quit the light"
400,4,763,"Of such a dark soul, and do thou the rite"
400,4,764,Of burial to him with a funeral feast.’
400,4,765,"With these last words I fortified my breast,"
400,4,766,In which again a gen’rous spring began
400,4,767,"Of fitting comfort, as I was a man;"
400,4,768,"But, as a brother, I must ever mourn."
400,4,769,"Yet forth I went, and told him the return"
400,4,770,"Of these I knew; but he had nam’d a third,"
400,4,771,"Held on the broad sea, still with life inspir’d,"
400,4,772,"Whom I besought to know, though likewise dead,"
400,4,773,And I must mourn alike. He answeréd:
400,4,774,‘He is Laertes’ son; whom I beheld
400,4,775,"In nymph Calypso’s palace, who compell’d"
400,4,776,"His stay with her, and, since he could not see"
400,4,777,"His country earth, he mourn’d incessantly."
400,4,778,"For he had neither ship instruct with oars,"
400,4,779,Nor men to fetch him from those stranger shores.
400,4,780,"Where leave we him, and to thy self descend,"
400,4,781,"Whom not in Argos Fate nor Death shall end,"
400,4,782,"But the immortal ends of all the earth,"
400,4,783,"So rul’d by them that order death by birth,"
400,4,784,"The fields Elysian, Fate to thee will give;"
400,4,785,"Where Rhadamanthus rules, and where men live"
400,4,786,"A never - troubled life, where snow, nor show’rs,"
400,4,787,"Nor irksome Winter spends his fruitless pow’rs,"
400,4,788,But from the ocean Zephyr still resumes
400,4,789,"A constant breath, that all the fields perfumes."
400,4,790,"Which, since thou marriedst Helen, are thy hire,"
400,4,791,And Jove himself is by her side thy sire.’
400,4,792,This said; he div’d the deepsome wat’ry heaps;
400,4,793,"I and my tried men took us to our ships,"
400,4,794,And worlds of thoughts I varied with my steps.
400,4,795,"Arriv’d and shipp’d, the silent solemn night"
400,4,796,And sleep bereft us of our visual light.
400,4,797,"At morn, masts, sails, rear’d, we sat, left the shores,"
400,4,798,And beat the foamy ocean with our oars.
400,4,799,"Again then we the Jove - fall’n flood did fetch,"
400,4,800,As far as Ægypt; where we did beseech
400,4,801,"The Gods with hecatombs; whose angers ceast,"
400,4,802,I tomb’d my brother that I might be blest.
400,4,803,"All rites perform’d, all haste I made for home,"
400,4,804,"And all the prosp’rous winds about were come,"
400,4,805,"I had the passport now of ev’ry God,"
400,4,806,And here clos’d all these labours’ period.
400,4,807,"Here stay then till th’ eleventh or twelfth day’s light,"
400,4,808,"And I’ll dismiss thee well, gifts exquisite"
400,4,809,"Preparing for thee, chariot, horses three,"
400,4,810,A cup of curious frame to serve for thee
400,4,811,"To serve th’ immortal Gods with sacrifice,"
400,4,812,Mindful of me while all suns light thy skies.”
400,4,813,"He answer’d: “Stay me not too long time here,"
400,4,814,Though I could sit attending all the year.
400,4,815,"Nor should my house, nor parents, with desire,"
400,4,816,"Take my affections from you, so on fire"
400,4,817,With love to hear you are my thoughts; but so
400,4,818,My Pylian friends I shall afflict with woe
400,4,819,Who mourn ev’n this stay. Whatsoever be
400,4,820,"The gifts your grace is to bestow on me,"
400,4,821,Vouchsafe them such as I may bear and save
400,4,822,"For your sake ever. Horse, I list not have,"
400,4,823,"To keep in Ithaca, but leave them here,"
400,4,824,"To your soil’s dainties, where the broad fields bear"
400,4,825,"Sweet cypers grass, where men - fed lote doth flow,"
400,4,826,"Where wheat - like spelt, and wheat itself, doth grow,"
400,4,827,"Where barley, white, and spreading like a tree;"
400,4,828,"But Ithaca hath neither ground to be,"
400,4,829,"For any length it comprehends, a race"
400,4,830,"To try a horse’s speed, nor any place"
400,4,831,To make him fat in; fitter far to feed
400,4,832,"A cliff - bred goat, than raise or please a steed."
400,4,833,"Of all isles, Ithaca doth least provide"
400,4,834,"Or meads to feed a horse, or ways to ride.”"
400,4,835,"He, smiling, said: “Of good blood art thou, son."
400,4,836,"What speech, so young! What observatión"
400,4,837,Hast thou made of the world! I well am pleas’d
400,4,838,"To change my gifts to thee, as being confess’d"
400,4,839,"Unfit indeed, my store is such I may."
400,4,840,"Of all my house - gifts then, that up I lay"
400,4,841,"For treasure there, I will bestow on thee"
400,4,842,"The fairest, and of greatest price to me."
400,4,843,"I will bestow on thee a rich carv’d cup,"
400,4,844,"Of silver all, but all the brims wrought up"
400,4,845,With finest gold; it was the only thing
400,4,846,That the heroical Sidonian king
400,4,847,"Presented to me, when we were to part"
400,4,848,"At his receipt of me, and ’twas the art"
400,4,849,Of that great Artist that of heav’n is free;
400,4,850,And yet ev’n this will I bestow on thee.”
400,4,851,"This speech thus ended, guests came, and did bring"
400,4,852,"Muttons, for presents, to the God - like king,"
400,4,853,"And spirit - prompting wine, that strenuous makes."
400,4,854,Their riband - wreathed wives brought fruit and cakes.
400,4,855,Thus in this house did these their feast apply;
400,4,856,And in Ulysses’ house activity
400,4,857,"The Wooers practis’d; tossing of the spear,"
400,4,858,"The stone, and hurling; thus delighted, where"
400,4,859,"They exercis’d such insolence before,"
400,4,860,Ev’n in the court that wealthy pavements wore
400,4,861,"Antinous did still their strifes decide,"
400,4,862,And he that was in person deified
400,4,863,"Eurymachus; both ring - leaders of all,"
400,4,864,For in their virtues they were principal.
400,4,865,"These by Noëmon, son to Phronius,"
400,4,866,"Were sided now, who made the question thus:"
400,4,867,"“Antinous! Does any friend here know,"
400,4,868,"When this Telemachus returns, or no,"
400,4,869,From sandy Pylos? He made bold to take
400,4,870,"My ship with him; of which, I now should make"
400,4,871,"Fit use myself, and sail in her as far"
400,4,872,"As spacious Elis, where of mine there are"
400,4,873,"Twelve delicate mares, and under their sides go"
400,4,874,"Laborious mules, that yet did never know"
400,4,875,"The yoke, nor labour; some of which should bear"
400,4,876,"The taming now, if I could fetch them there.”"
400,4,877,"This speech the rest admir’d, nor dream’d that he"
400,4,878,"Neleïan Pylos ever thought to see,"
400,4,879,"But was at field about his flocks’ survey,"
400,4,880,Or thought his herdsmen held him so away.
400,4,881,"Eupitheus son, Antinous, then replied:"
400,4,882,"“When went he, or with what train dignified?"
400,4,883,Of his selected Ithacensian youth?
400,4,884,"Prest men, or bond men, were they? Tell the truth."
400,4,885,Could he effect this? Let me truly know.
400,4,886,"To gain thy vessel did he violence show,"
400,4,887,"And us’d her ’gainst thy will? or had her free,"
400,4,888,When fitting question he had made with thee?”
400,4,889,Noëmon answer’d: “I did freely give
400,4,890,My vessel to him. Who deserves to live
400,4,891,"That would do other, when such men as he"
400,4,892,Did in distress ask? He should churlish be
400,4,893,That would deny him. Of our youth the best
400,4,894,"Amongst the people, to the interest"
400,4,895,"His charge did challenge in them, giving way,"
400,4,896,With all the tribute all their pow’rs could pay.
400,4,897,"Their captain, as he took the ship, I knew,"
400,4,898,"Who Mentor was, or God. A Deity’s shew"
400,4,899,"Mask’d in his likeness. But, to think ’twas he,"
400,4,900,"I much admire, for I did clearly see,"
400,4,901,"But yester - morning, God - like Mentor here;"
400,4,902,"Yet th’ other ev’ning he took shipping there,"
400,4,903,"And went for Pylos.” Thus went he for home,"
400,4,904,And left the rest with envy overcome;
400,4,905,"Who sat, and pastime left. Eupitheus son,"
400,4,906,"Sad, and with rage his entrails overrun,"
400,4,907,"His eyes like flames, thus interpos’d his speech:"
400,4,908,“Strange thing! An action of how proud a reach
400,4,909,Is here committed by Telemachus!
400,4,910,"A boy, a child, and we, a sort of us,"
400,4,911,"Vow’d ’gainst his voyage, yet admit it thus!"
400,4,912,With ship and choice youth of our people too!
400,4,913,"But let him on, and all his mischief do,"
400,4,914,"Jove shall convert upon himself his pow’rs,"
400,4,915,Before their ill presum’d he brings on ours.
400,4,916,"Provide me then a ship, and twenty men"
400,4,917,"To give her manage, that, against again"
400,4,918,"He turns for home, on th’ Ithacensian seas,"
400,4,919,"Or cliffy Samian, I may interprease,"
400,4,920,"Way - lay, and take him, and make all his craft"
400,4,921,Sail with his ruin for his father saft.”
400,4,922,"This all applauded, and gave charge to do,"
400,4,923,"Rose, and to greet Ulysses’ house did go."
400,4,924,"But long time past not, ere Penelope"
400,4,925,Had notice of their far - fetch’d treachery.
400,4,926,"Medon the herald told her, who had heard"
400,4,927,"Without the hall how they within conferr’d,"
400,4,928,"And hasted straight to tell it to the queen,"
400,4,929,"Who, from the entry having Medon seen,"
400,4,930,"Prevents him thus: “Now herald, what affair"
400,4,931,"Intend the famous Wooers, in your repair?"
400,4,932,To tell Ulysses’ maids that they must cease
400,4,933,"From doing our work, and their banquets dress?"
400,4,934,"I would to heav’n, that, leaving wooing me,"
400,4,935,"Nor ever troubling other company,"
400,4,936,"Here might the last feast be, and most extreme,"
400,4,937,That ever any shall address for them.
400,4,938,"They never meet but to consent in spoil,"
400,4,939,And reap the free fruits of another’s toil.
400,4,940,"O did they never, when they children were,"
400,4,941,"What to their fathers was Ulysses, hear?"
400,4,942,Who never did ’gainst anyone proceed
400,4,943,"With unjust usage, or in word or deed?"
400,4,944,"’Tis yet with other kings another right,"
400,4,945,"One to pursue with love, another spite;"
400,4,946,"He still yet just, nor would, though might, devour,"
400,4,947,Nor to the worst did ever taste of pow’r.
400,4,948,But their unrul’d acts show their minds’ estate.
400,4,949,"Good turns receiv’d once, thanks grow out of date.”"
400,4,950,"Medon, the learn’d in wisdom, answer’d her:"
400,4,951,"“I wish, O queen, that their ingratitudes were"
400,4,952,"Their worst ill towards you; but worse by far,"
400,4,953,"And much more deadly, their endeavours are,"
400,4,954,Which Jove will fail them in. Telemachus
400,4,955,"Their purpose is, as he returns to us,"
400,4,956,To give their sharp steels in a cruel death;
400,4,957,"Who now is gone to learn, if fame can breathe"
400,4,958,"News of his sire, and will the Pylian shore,"
400,4,959,"And sacred Sparta, in his search explore.”"
400,4,960,"This news dissolv’d to her both knees and heart,"
400,4,961,"Long silence held her ere one word would part,"
400,4,962,"Her eyes stood full of tears, her small soft voice"
400,4,963,All late use lost; that yet at last had choice
400,4,964,"Of wonted words, which briefly thus she us’d:"
400,4,965,“Why left my son his mother? Why refus’d
400,4,966,"His wit the solid shore, to try the seas,"
400,4,967,"And put in ships the trust of his distress,"
400,4,968,"That are at sea to men unbridled horse,"
400,4,969,"And run, past rule, their far - engagéd course,"
400,4,970,Amidst a moisture past all mean unstaid?
400,4,971,"No need compell’d this. Did he it, afraid"
400,4,972,To live and leave posterity his name?”
400,4,973,"“I know not,” he replied, “if th’ humour came"
400,4,974,"From current of his own instinct, or flow’d"
400,4,975,From others’ instigations; but he vow’d
400,4,976,"Attempt to Pylos, or to see descried"
400,4,977,"His sire’s return, or know what death he died.”"
400,4,978,"This said, he took him to Ulysses’ house"
400,4,979,"After the Wooers; the Ulyssean spouse,"
400,4,980,"Run through with woes, let Torture seize her mind,"
400,4,981,Nor in her choice of state chairs stood inclin’d
400,4,982,"To take her seat, but th’ abject threshold chose"
400,4,983,"Of her fair chamber for her loath’d repose,"
400,4,984,And mourn’d most wretch - like. Round about her fell
400,4,985,"Her handmaids, join’d in a continuate yell."
400,4,986,"From ev’ry corner of the palace, all"
400,4,987,Of all degrees tun’d to her comfort’s fall
400,4,988,Their own dejections; to whom her complaint
400,4,989,"She thus enforc’d: “The Gods, beyond constraint"
400,4,990,"Of any measure, urge these tears on me;"
400,4,991,Nor was there ever dame of my degree
400,4,992,"So past degree griev’d. First, a lord so good,"
400,4,993,"That had such hardy spirits in his blood,"
400,4,994,"That all the virtues was adorn’d withall,"
400,4,995,"That all the Greeks did their superior call,"
400,4,996,"To part with thus, and lose! And now a son,"
400,4,997,"So worthily belov’d, a course to run"
400,4,998,Beyond my knowledge; whom rude tempests have
400,4,999,Made far from home his most inglorious grave!
400,4,1000,"Unhappy wenches, that no one of all"
400,4,1001,(Though in the reach of ev’ry one must fall
400,4,1002,"His taking ship) sustain’d the careful mind,"
400,4,1003,"To call me from my bed, who this design’d"
400,4,1004,"And most vow’d course in him had either stay’d,"
400,4,1005,"How much soever hasted, or dead laid"
400,4,1006,"He should have left me. Many a man I have,"
400,4,1007,"That would have call’d old Dolius my slave,"
400,4,1008,"(That keeps my orchard, whom my father gave"
400,4,1009,"At my departure) to have run, and told"
400,4,1010,Laertes this; to try if he could hold
400,4,1011,"From running through the people, and from tears,"
400,4,1012,In telling them of these vow’d murderers;
400,4,1013,"That both divine Ulysses’ hope, and his,"
400,4,1014,Resolv’d to end in their conspiracies.”
400,4,1015,"His nurse then, Euryclea, made reply:"
400,4,1016,"“Dear sov’reign, let me with your own hands die,"
400,4,1017,"Or cast me off here, I’ll not keep from thee"
400,4,1018,One word of what I know. He trusted me
400,4,1019,"With all his purpose, and I gave him all"
400,4,1020,The bread and wine for which he pleas’d to call.
400,4,1021,"But then a mighty oath he made me swear,"
400,4,1022,Not to report it to your royal ear
400,4,1023,"Before the twelfth day either should appear,"
400,4,1024,Or you should ask me when you heard him gone.
400,4,1025,"Impair not then your beauties with your moan,"
400,4,1026,"But wash, and put untear - stain’d garments on,"
400,4,1027,"Ascend your chamber with your ladies here,"
400,4,1028,"And pray the seed of goat - nurs’d Jupiter,"
400,4,1029,"Divine Athenia, to preserve your son,"
400,4,1030,"And she will save him from confusión,"
400,4,1031,"Th’ old king, to whom your hopes stand so inclin’d"
400,4,1032,"For his grave counsels, you perhaps may find"
400,4,1033,"Unfit affected, for his age’s sake."
400,4,1034,"But heav’n - kings wax not old, and therefore make"
400,4,1035,Fit pray’rs to them; for my thoughts never will
400,4,1036,Believe the heav’nly Pow’rs conceit so ill
400,4,1037,"The seed of righteous Arcesiades,"
400,4,1038,"To end it utterly, but still will please"
400,4,1039,In some place evermore some one of them
400,4,1040,"To save, and deck him with a diadem,"
400,4,1041,"Give him possession of erected tow’rs,"
400,4,1042,"And far - stretch’d fields, crown’d all of fruits and flowr’s.”"
400,4,1043,"This eas’d her heart, and dried her humorous eyes,"
400,4,1044,"When having wash’d, and weeds of sacrifice"
400,4,1045,"Pure, and unstain’d with her distrustful tears,"
400,4,1046,"Put on, with all her women - ministers"
400,4,1047,"Up to a chamber of most height she rose,"
400,4,1048,And cakes of salt and barley did impose
400,4,1049,Within a wicker basket; all which broke
400,4,1050,"In decent order, thus she did invoke:"
400,4,1051,"“Great Virgin of the goat - preservéd God,"
400,4,1052,If ever the inhabited abode
400,4,1053,Of wise Ulysses held the fatted thighs
400,4,1054,"Of sheep and oxen, made thy sacrifice"
400,4,1055,"By his devotion, hear me, nor forget"
400,4,1056,"His pious services, but safe see set"
400,4,1057,"His dear son on these shores, and banish hence"
400,4,1058,These Wooers past all mean in insolence.”
400,4,1059,"This said, she shriek’d, and Pallas heard her pray’r."
400,4,1060,The Wooers broke with tumult all the air
400,4,1061,"About the shady house; and one of them,"
400,4,1062,"Whose pride his youth had made the more extreme,"
400,4,1063,Said: “Now the many - wooer - honour’d queen
400,4,1064,"Will surely satiate her delayful spleen,"
400,4,1065,And one of us in instant nuptials take.
400,4,1066,"Poor dame, she dreams not, what design we make"
400,4,1067,Upon the life and slaughter of her son.”
400,4,1068,So said he; but so said was not so done;
400,4,1069,Whose arrogant spirit in a vaunt so vain
400,4,1070,"Antinous chid, and said: “For shame, contain"
400,4,1071,These braving speeches. Who can tell who hears?
400,4,1072,Are we not now in reach of others’ ears?
400,4,1073,"If our intentions please us, let us call"
400,4,1074,"Our spirits up to them, and let speeches fall."
400,4,1075,By watchful danger men must silent go.
400,4,1076,"What we resolve on, let’s not say, but do.”"
400,4,1077,"This said, he choos’d out twenty men, that bore"
400,4,1078,"Best reckoning with him, and to ship and shore"
400,4,1079,"All hasted, reach’d the ship, launch’d, rais’d the mast,"
400,4,1080,"Put sails in, and with leather loops made fast"
400,4,1081,"The oars; sails hoisted, arms their men did bring,"
400,4,1082,All giving speed and form to ev’rything.
400,4,1083,"Then to the high deeps their rigg’d vessel driven,"
400,4,1084,"They supp’d, expecting the approaching even."
400,4,1085,"Mean space, Penelope her chamber kept"
400,4,1086,"And bed, and neither eat, nor drank, nor slept,"
400,4,1087,"Her strong thoughts wrought so on her blameless son,"
400,4,1088,"Still in contention, if he should be done"
400,4,1089,"To death, or ‘scape the impious Wooers’ design."
400,4,1090,"Look how a lion, whom men - troops combine"
400,4,1091,"To hunt, and close him in a crafty ring,"
400,4,1092,"Much varied thought conceives, and fear doth sting"
400,4,1093,"For urgent danger; so far’d she, till sleep"
400,4,1094,All juncture of her joints and nerves did steep
400,4,1095,"In his dissolving humour. When, at rest,"
400,4,1096,"Pallas her favours varied, when addrest"
400,4,1097,"An idol, that Iphthima did present"
400,4,1098,"In structure of her ev’ry lineament,[5]"
400,4,1099,"Great - soul’d Icarius’ daughter, whom for spouse"
400,4,1100,"Eumelus took, that kept in Pheris’ house."
400,4,1101,"This to divine Ulysses’ house she sent,"
400,4,1102,To try her best mean how she might content
400,4,1103,"Mournful Penelope, and make relent"
400,4,1104,The strict addiction in her to deplore.
400,4,1105,"This idol, like a worm, that less or more[6]"
400,4,1106,"Contracts or strains her, did itself convey,"
400,4,1107,"Beyond the wards or windings of the key,"
400,4,1108,"Into the chamber, and, above her head"
400,4,1109,"Her seat assuming, thus she comforted"
400,4,1110,Distress’d Penelope: “Doth sleep thus seize
400,4,1111,"Thy pow’rs, affected with so much dis - ease?"
400,4,1112,"The Gods, that nothing troubles, will not see"
400,4,1113,"Thy tears nor griefs, in any least degree,"
400,4,1114,"Sustain’d with cause, for they will guard thy son"
400,4,1115,Safe to his wish’d and native mansión.
400,4,1116,"Since he is no offender of their states,"
400,4,1117,And they to such are firmer than their fates.”
400,4,1118,"The wise Penelope receiv’d her thus,"
400,4,1119,"Bound with a slumber most delicious,"
400,4,1120,"And in the port of dreams: “O sister, why"
400,4,1121,"Repair you hither, since so far off lie"
400,4,1122,Your house and household? You were never here
400,4,1123,"Before this hour, and would you now give cheer"
400,4,1124,"To my so many woes and miseries,"
400,4,1125,Affecting fitly all the faculties
400,4,1126,"My soul and mind hold, having lost before"
400,4,1127,"A husband, that of all the virtues bore"
400,4,1128,"The palm amongst the Greeks, and whose renown"
400,4,1129,So ample was that Fame the sound hath blown
400,4,1130,Through Greece and Argos to her very heart?
400,4,1131,"And now again, a son, that did convert"
400,4,1132,"My whole pow’rs to his love, by ship is gone;"
400,4,1133,"A tender plant, that yet was never grown"
400,4,1134,"To labour’s taste, nor the commerce of men;"
400,4,1135,"For whom more than my husband I complain,"
400,4,1136,And lest he should at any suff’rance touch
400,4,1137,"(Or in the sea, or by the men so much"
400,4,1138,Estrang’d to him that must his consorts be)
400,4,1139,Fear and chill tremblings shake each joint of me.
400,4,1140,"Besides, his danger sets on foes profess’d"
400,4,1141,"To way - lay his return, that have address’d"
400,4,1142,"Plots for his death.” The scarce - discernéd Dream,"
400,4,1143,"Said: “Be of comfort, nor fears so extreme"
400,4,1144,Let thus dismay thee; thou hast such a mate
400,4,1145,"Attending thee, as some at any rate"
400,4,1146,"Would wish to purchase, for her pow’r is great;"
400,4,1147,"Minerva pities thy delights’ defeat,"
400,4,1148,Whose grace hath sent me to foretell thee these.”
400,4,1149,"“If thou,” said she, “be of the Goddesses,"
400,4,1150,"And heardst her tell thee these, thou mayst as well"
400,4,1151,"From her tell all things else. Deign then to tell,"
400,4,1152,"If yet the man to all misfortunes born,"
400,4,1153,"My husband, lives, and sees the sun adorn"
400,4,1154,"The darksome earth, or hides his wretched head"
400,4,1155,"In Pluto’s house, and lives amongst the dead?”"
400,4,1156,"“I will not,” she replied, “my breath exhale"
400,4,1157,"In one continued and perpetual tale,"
400,4,1158,"Lives he or dies he. ’Tis a filthy use,"
400,4,1159,To be in vain and idle speech profuse.”
400,4,1160,"This said, she, through the key - hole of the door,"
400,4,1161,Vanish’d again into the open blore.
400,4,1162,"Icarius’ daughter started from her sleep,"
400,4,1163,"And Joy’s fresh humour her lov’d breast did steep,"
400,4,1164,"When now so clear, in that first watch of night,"
400,4,1165,She saw the seen Dream vanish from her sight.
400,4,1166,"The Wooers’ ship the sea’s moist waves did ply,"
400,4,1167,And thought the prince a haughty death should die.
400,4,1168,"There lies a certain island in the sea,"
400,4,1169,"Twixt rocky Samos and rough Ithaca,"
400,4,1170,"That cliffy is itself, and nothing great,"
400,4,1171,Yet holds convenient havens that two ways let
400,4,1172,"Ships in and out, call’d Asteris; and there"
400,4,1173,The Wooers hop’d to make their massacre.

400,5,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,5,2,A second Court on Jove attends;
400,5,3,"Who Hermes to Calypso sends,"
400,5,4,Commanding her to clear the ways
400,5,5,Ulysses sought; and she obeys.
400,5,6,"When Neptune saw Ulysses free,"
400,5,7,"And so in safety plough the sea,"
400,5,8,"Enrag’d, he ruffles up the waves,"
400,5,9,And splits his ship. Leucothea saves
400,5,10,"His person yet, as being a Dame"
400,5,11,Whose Godhead govern’d in the frame
400,5,12,"Of those seas’ tempers. But the mean,"
400,5,13,"By which she curbs dread Neptune’s spleen,"
400,5,14,"Is made a jewel, which she takes"
400,5,15,"From off her head, and that she makes"
400,5,16,"Ulysses on his bosom wear,"
400,5,17,"About his neck, she ties it there,"
400,5,18,"And, when he is with waves beset,"
400,5,19,"Bids wear it as an amulet,"
400,5,20,"Commanding him, that not before"
400,5,21,"He touch’d upon Phæacia’s shore,"
400,5,22,"He should not part with it, but then"
400,5,23,"Return it to the sea again,"
400,5,24,And cast it from him. He performs;
400,5,25,"Yet, after this, bides bitter storms,"
400,5,26,"And in the rocks sees death engrav’d,"
400,5,27,But on Phæacia’s shore is sav’d.
400,5,28,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,5,29,E.
400,5,30,Ulysses builds
400,5,31,A ship; and gains
400,5,32,The glassy fields;
400,5,33,Pays Neptune pains.
400,5,34,"Aurora rose from high - born Tithon’s bed,"
400,5,35,"That men and Gods might be illustrated,"
400,5,36,"And then the Deities sat. Imperial Jove,"
400,5,37,"That makes the horrid murmur beat above,"
400,5,38,"Took place past all, whose height for ever springs,"
400,5,39,And from whom flowers th’ eternal pow’r of things.
400,5,40,"Then Pallas, mindful of Ulysses, told"
400,5,41,The many cares that in Calypso’s hold
400,5,42,"He still sustain’d, when he had felt before"
400,5,43,"So much affliction, and such dangers more."
400,5,44,"“O Father,” said she, “and ye Ever - blest,"
400,5,45,Give never king hereafter interest
400,5,46,"In any aid of yours, by serving you,"
400,5,47,"By being gentle, human, just, but grow"
400,5,48,"Rude, and for ever scornful of your rights,"
400,5,49,"All justice ord’ring by their appetites,"
400,5,50,"Since he, that rul’d as it in right behov’d,"
400,5,51,"That all his subjects as his children lov’d,"
400,5,52,Finds you so thoughtless of him and his birth.
400,5,53,"Thus men begin to say, ye rule in earth,"
400,5,54,"And grudge at what ye let him undergo,"
400,5,55,Who yet the least part of his suff’rance know:
400,5,56,"Thrall’d in an island, shipwrack’d in his tears,"
400,5,57,"And, in the fancies that Calypso bears,"
400,5,58,"Bound from his birthright, all his shipping gone,"
400,5,59,And of his soldiers not retaining one.
400,5,60,And now his most - lov’d son’s life doth inflame
400,5,61,Their slaught’rous envies; since his father’s fame
400,5,62,"He puts in pursuit, and is gone as far"
400,5,63,"As sacred Pylos, and the singular"
400,5,64,"Dame - breeding Sparta.” This, with this reply,"
400,5,65,The Cloud - assembler answer’d: “What words fly
400,5,66,"Thine own remembrance, daughter? Hast not thou"
400,5,67,"The counsel giv’n thyself, that told thee how"
400,5,68,Ulysses shall with his return address
400,5,69,"His Wooers wrong? And, for the safe access"
400,5,70,"His son shall make to his innative port,"
400,5,71,"Do thou direct it, in as curious sort"
400,5,72,As thy wit serves thee; it obeys thy pow’rs;
400,5,73,And in their ship return the speedless Wooers.”
400,5,74,"Then turn’d he to his issue Mercury,"
400,5,75,And said: “Thou hast made good our ambassy
400,5,76,"To th’ other Statists, to the Nymph then now,"
400,5,77,"On whose fair head a tuft of gold doth grow,"
400,5,78,"Bear our true - spoken counsel, for retreat"
400,5,79,Of patient Ulysses; who shall get
400,5,80,"No aid from us, nor any mortal man,"
400,5,81,"But in a patch’d - up skiff (built as he can,[1]"
400,5,82,And suff’ring woes enough) the twentieth day
400,5,83,"At fruitful Scheria let him breathe his way,"
400,5,84,"With the Phæacians, that half Deities live,"
400,5,85,"Who like a God will honour him, and give"
400,5,86,"His wisdom clothes, and ship, and brass, and gold,"
400,5,87,More than for gain of Troy he ever told;
400,5,88,"Where, at the whole division of the prey,"
400,5,89,"If he a saver were, or got away"
400,5,90,"Without a wound, if he should grudge, ’twas well."
400,5,91,But th’ end shall crown all; therefore Fate will deal
400,5,92,"So well with him, to let him land, and see"
400,5,93,"His native earth, friends, house, and family.”"
400,5,94,"Thus charg’d he; nor Argicides denied,"
400,5,95,"But to his feet his fair wing’d shoes he tied,"
400,5,96,"Ambrosian, golden, that in his command"
400,5,97,"Put either sea, or the unmeasur’d land,"
400,5,98,With pace as speedy as a puft of wind.
400,5,99,"Then up his rod went, with which he declin’d"
400,5,100,"The eyes of any waker, when he pleas’d,"
400,5,101,"And any sleeper, when he wish’d, diseas’d."
400,5,102,"This took; he stoop’d Pieria, and thence"
400,5,103,"Glid through the air, and Neptune’s confluence"
400,5,104,"Kiss’d as he flew, and check’d the waves as light"
400,5,105,"As any sea - mew in her fishing flight,"
400,5,106,Her thick wings sousing in the savory seas.
400,5,107,"Like her, he pass’d a world of wilderness;"
400,5,108,"But when the far - off isle he touch’d, he went"
400,5,109,"Up from the blue sea to the continent,"
400,5,110,"And reach’d the ample cavern of the Queen,"
400,5,111,"Whom he within found, without seldom seen."
400,5,112,"A sun - like fire upon the hearth did flame,"
400,5,113,"The matter precious, and divine the frame,"
400,5,114,"Of cedar cleft and incense was the pile,"
400,5,115,That breath’d an odour round about the isle.
400,5,116,"Herself was seated in an inner room,"
400,5,117,"Whom sweetly sing he heard, and at her loom,"
400,5,118,"About a curious web, whose yarn she threw"
400,5,119,In with a golden shittle. A grove grew
400,5,120,"In endless spring about her cavern round,"
400,5,121,"With odorous cypress, pines, and poplars, crown’d,"
400,5,122,"Where hawks, sea - owls, and long - tongued bittours bred,"
400,5,123,And other birds their shady pinions spread;
400,5,124,"All fowls maritimal; none roosted there,"
400,5,125,But those whose labours in the waters were.
400,5,126,"A vine did all the hollow cave embrace,"
400,5,127,"Still green, yet still ripe bunches gave it grace."
400,5,128,"Four fountains, one against another, pour’d"
400,5,129,Their silver streams; and meadows all enflower’d
400,5,130,"With sweet balm - gentle, and blue - violets hid,"
400,5,131,That deck’d the soft breasts of each fragrant mead.
400,5,132,"Should anyone, though he immortal were,"
400,5,133,"Arrive and see the sacred objects there,"
400,5,134,"He would admire them, and be over - joy’d;"
400,5,135,"And so stood Hermes’ ravish’d pow’rs employ’d,"
400,5,136,"But having all admir’d, he enter’d on"
400,5,137,"The ample cave, nor could be seen unknown"
400,5,138,Of great Calypso (for all Deities are
400,5,139,"Prompt in each other’s knowledge, though so far"
400,5,140,Sever’d in dwellings) but he could not see
400,5,141,"Ulysses there within; without was he,"
400,5,142,"Set sad ashore, where ’twas his use to view"
400,5,143,"Th’ unquiet sea, sigh’d, wept, and empty drew"
400,5,144,"His heart of comfort. Plac’d here in her throne,"
400,5,145,"That beams cast up to admiratión,"
400,5,146,Divine Calypso question’d Hermes thus:
400,5,147,"“For what cause, dear, and much - esteem’d by us,"
400,5,148,"Thou golden - rod - adorned Mercury,"
400,5,149,Arriv’st thou here? Thou hast not us’d t’ apply
400,5,150,"Thy passage this way. Say, whatever be"
400,5,151,"Thy heart’s desire, my mind commands it thee,"
400,5,152,"If in my means it lie, or pow’r of fact."
400,5,153,"But first, what hospitable rites exact,"
400,5,154,"Come yet more near, and take.” This said, she set"
400,5,155,"A table forth, and furnish’d it with meat,"
400,5,156,Such as the Gods taste; and serv’d in with it
400,5,157,Vermilion nectar. When with banquet fit
400,5,158,"He had confirm’d his spirits, he thus exprest"
400,5,159,"His cause of coming: “Thou hast made request,"
400,5,160,"Goddess of Goddesses, to understand"
400,5,161,"My cause of touch here; which thou shalt command,"
400,5,162,And know with truth: Jove caus’d my course to thee
400,5,163,"Against my will, for who would willingly"
400,5,164,"Lackey along so vast a lake of brine,"
400,5,165,Near to no city that the Pow’rs divine
400,5,166,Receives with solemn rites and hecatombs?
400,5,167,"But Jove’s will ever all law overcomes,"
400,5,168,No other God can cross or make it void;
400,5,169,"And he affirms, that one the most annoy’d"
400,5,170,With woes and toils of all those men that fought
400,5,171,"For Priam’s city, and to end hath brought"
400,5,172,"Nine years in the contention, is with thee."
400,5,173,"For in the tenth year, when roy victory"
400,5,174,"Was won to give the Greeks the spoil of Troy,"
400,5,175,"Return they did profess, but not enjoy,"
400,5,176,"Since Pallas they incens’d, and she the waves"
400,5,177,"By all the winds’ pow’r, that blew ope their graves."
400,5,178,And there they rested. Only this poor one
400,5,179,This coast both winds and waves have cast upon;
400,5,180,"Whom now forthwith he wills thee to dismiss,"
400,5,181,Affirming that th’ unalter’d Destinies
400,5,182,Not only have decreed he shall not die
400,5,183,"Apart his friends, but of necessity"
400,5,184,"Enjoy their sights before those fatal hours,"
400,5,185,"His country earth reach, and erected tow’rs.”"
400,5,186,"This struck a love - check’d horror through her pow’rs,"
400,5,187,"When, naming him, she this reply did give:"
400,5,188,"“Insatiate are ye Gods, past all that live,"
400,5,189,In all things you affect; which still converts
400,5,190,"Your pow’rs to envies. It afflicts your hearts,"
400,5,191,"That any Goddess should, as you obtain"
400,5,192,"The use of earthly dames, enjoy the men,"
400,5,193,"And most in open marriage. So ye far’d,"
400,5,194,When the delicious - finger’d Morning shar’d
400,5,195,Orion’s bed; you easy - living States
400,5,196,"Could never satisfy your emulous hates,"
400,5,197,"Till in Ortygia the precise - liv’d Dame,"
400,5,198,"Gold - thron’d Diana, on him rudely came,"
400,5,199,"And with her swift shafts slew him. And such pains,"
400,5,200,When rich - hair’d Ceres pleas’d to give the reins
400,5,201,"To her affections, and the grace did yield"
400,5,202,"Of love and bed, amidst a three - cropp’d field,"
400,5,203,"To her Iasion, he paid angry Jove,"
400,5,204,"Who lost no long time notice of their love,"
400,5,205,But with a glowing lightning was his death.
400,5,206,And now your envies labour underneath
400,5,207,A mortal’s choice of mine; whose life I took
400,5,208,"To lib’ral safety, when his ship Jove strook,"
400,5,209,"With red - hot flashes, piece - meal in the seas,"
400,5,210,And all his friends and soldiers succourless
400,5,211,"Perish’d but he. Him, cast upon this coast"
400,5,212,"With blasts and billows, I, in life giv’n lost,"
400,5,213,"Preserv’d alone, lov’d, nourish’d, and did vow"
400,5,214,"To make him deathless, and yet never grow"
400,5,215,"Crooked, or worn with age, his whole life long."
400,5,216,But since no reason may be made so strong
400,5,217,"To strive with Jove’s will, or to make it vain,"
400,5,218,No not if all the other Gods should strain
400,5,219,"Their pow’rs against it, let his will be law,"
400,5,220,"So he afford him fit means to withdraw,"
400,5,221,"As he commands him, to the raging main."
400,5,222,"But means from me he never shall obtain,"
400,5,223,"For my means yield nor men, nor ship, nor oars,"
400,5,224,To set him off from my so envied shores.
400,5,225,But if my counsel and good will can aid
400,5,226,"His safe pass home, my best shall be assay’d.”"
400,5,227,"“Vouchsafe it so,” said heav’n’s ambassador,"
400,5,228,“And deign it quickly. By all means abhor
400,5,229,"T’ incense Jove’s wrath against thee, that with grace"
400,5,230,He may hereafter all thy wish embrace.”
400,5,231,Thus took the Argus - killing God his wings.
400,5,232,And since the rev’rend Nymph these awful things
400,5,233,"Receiv’d from Jove, she to Ulysses went;"
400,5,234,"Whom she ashore found, drown’d in discontent,"
400,5,235,"His eyes kept never dry he did so mourn,"
400,5,236,And waste his dear age for his wish’d return;
400,5,237,"Which still without the cave he us’d to do,"
400,5,238,"Because he could not please the Goddess so,"
400,5,239,"At night yet, forc’d, together took their rest,"
400,5,240,The willing Goddess and th’ unwilling Guest;
400,5,241,"But he all day in rocks, and on the shore,"
400,5,242,"The vex’d sea view’d, and did his fate deplore."
400,5,243,"Him, now, the Goddess coming near bespake:"
400,5,244,"“Unhappy man, no more discomfort take"
400,5,245,"For my constraint of thee, nor waste thine age,"
400,5,246,I now will passing freely disengage
400,5,247,"Thy irksome stay here. Come then, fell thee wood,"
400,5,248,"And build a ship, to save thee from the flood."
400,5,249,"I’ll furnish thee with fresh wave, bread, and wine"
400,5,250,"Ruddy and sweet, that will the piner pine,[2]"
400,5,251,"Put garments on thee, give the winds foreright,"
400,5,252,That ev’ry way thy home - bent appetite
400,5,253,May safe attain to it; if so it please
400,5,254,"At all parts all the heav’n - hous’d Deities,"
400,5,255,"That more in pow’r are, more in skill, than I,"
400,5,256,And more can judge what fits humanity.”
400,5,257,"He stood amaz’d at this strange change in her,"
400,5,258,And said: “O Goddess! Thy intents prefer
400,5,259,"Some other project than my parting hence,"
400,5,260,Commanding things of too high consequence
400,5,261,"For my performance, that myself should build"
400,5,262,"A ship of pow’r, my home - assays to shield"
400,5,263,Against the great sea of such dread to pass;
400,5,264,Which not the best - built ship that ever was
400,5,265,"Will pass exulting, when such winds, as Jove"
400,5,266,"Can thunder up, their trims and tacklings prove."
400,5,267,"But could I build one, I would ne’er aboard,"
400,5,268,"Thy will oppos’d, nor, won, without thy word,"
400,5,269,"Giv’n in the great oath of the Gods to me,"
400,5,270,Not to beguile me in the least degree.”
400,5,271,"The Goddess smil’d, held hard his hand, and said:"
400,5,272,"“O y’ are a shrewd one, and so habited"
400,5,273,In taking heed thou know’st not what it is
400,5,274,"To be unwary, nor use words amiss."
400,5,275,"How hast thou charm’d me, were I ne’er so sly!"
400,5,276,"Let earth know then, and heav’n, so broad, so high,"
400,5,277,"And th’ under - sunk waves of th’ infernal stream,"
400,5,278,"(Which is an oath, as terribly supreme,"
400,5,279,As any God swears) that I had no thought
400,5,280,"But stood with what I spake, nor would have wrought,"
400,5,281,"Nor counsell’d, any act against thy good;"
400,5,282,"But ever diligently weigh’d, and stood"
400,5,283,"On those points in persuading thee, that I"
400,5,284,Would use myself in such extremity.
400,5,285,"For my mind simple is, and innocent,"
400,5,286,"Not giv’n by cruel sleights to circumvent,"
400,5,287,"Nor bear I in my breast a heart of steel,"
400,5,288,But with the suff’rer willing suff’rance feel.”
400,5,289,"This said, the Grace of Goddesses led home,"
400,5,290,"He trac’d her steps; and, to the cavern come,"
400,5,291,"In that rich throne, whence Mercury arose,"
400,5,292,"He sat. The Nymph herself did then appose,"
400,5,293,"For food and bev’rage, to him all best meat"
400,5,294,"And drink, that mortals use to taste and eat."
400,5,295,"Then sat she opposite, and for her feast"
400,5,296,Was nectar and ambrosia addrest
400,5,297,"By handmaids to her. Both, what was prepar’d,"
400,5,298,"Did freely fall to. Having fitly far’d,"
400,5,299,The Nymph Calypso this discourse began:
400,5,300,“Jove - bred Ulysses! Many - witted man!
400,5,301,"Still is thy home so wish’d? So soon, away?"
400,5,302,"Be still of cheer, for all the worst I say."
400,5,303,"But, if thy soul knew what a sum of woes,"
400,5,304,"For thee to cast up, thy stern Fates impose,"
400,5,305,"Ere to thy country earth thy hopes attain,"
400,5,306,"Undoubtedly thy choice would here remain,"
400,5,307,"Keep house with me, and be a liver ever."
400,5,308,"Which, methinks, should thy house and thee dissever,"
400,5,309,"Though for thy wife there thou art set on fire,"
400,5,310,And all thy days are spent in her desire;
400,5,311,And though it be no boast in me to say
400,5,312,In form and mind I match her ev’ry way.
400,5,313,"Nor can it fit a mortal dame’s compare,"
400,5,314,T’ affect those terms with us that deathless are.”
400,5,315,The great - in - counsels made her this reply:
400,5,316,"“Renown’d, and to be rev’renc’d, Deity!"
400,5,317,"Let it not move thee, that so much I vow"
400,5,318,My comforts to my wife; though well I know
400,5,319,All cause myself why wise Penelope
400,5,320,"In wit is far inferior to thee,"
400,5,321,"In feature, stature, all the parts of show,"
400,5,322,"She being a mortal, an immortal thou,"
400,5,323,"Old ever growing, and yet never old."
400,5,324,"Yet her desire shall all my days see told,"
400,5,325,"Adding the sight of my returning day,"
400,5,326,And natural home. If any God shall lay
400,5,327,"His hand upon me as I pass the seas,"
400,5,328,"I’ll bear the worst of what his hand shall please,"
400,5,329,As having giv’n me such a mind as shall
400,5,330,The more still rise the more his hand lets fall.
400,5,331,In wars and waves my suff’rings were not small.
400,5,332,"I now have suffer’d much, as much before,"
400,5,333,"Hereafter let as much result, and more.”"
400,5,334,"This said, the sun set, and earth shadows gave;"
400,5,335,"When these two (in an in - room of the cave,"
400,5,336,Left to themselves) left love no rites undone.
400,5,337,"The early Morn up, up he rose, put on"
400,5,338,His in and out weed. She herself enchaces
400,5,339,"Amidst a white robe, full of all the Graces,"
400,5,340,"Ample, and pleated thick like fishy scales;"
400,5,341,A golden girdle then her waist impales;
400,5,342,Her head a veil decks; and abroad they come.
400,5,343,And now began Ulysses to go home.
400,5,344,"A great axe first she gave, that two ways cut,"
400,5,345,"In which a fair well - polish’d helm was put,"
400,5,346,That from an olive bough receiv’d his frame.
400,5,347,"A plainer then. Then led she, till they came"
400,5,348,To lofty woods that did the isle confine.
400,5,349,"The fir - tree, poplar, and heav’n - scaling pine,"
400,5,350,"Had there their offspring. Of which, those that were"
400,5,351,"Of driest matter, and grew longest there,"
400,5,352,"He choos’d for lighter sail. This place thus shown,"
400,5,353,"The Nymph turn’d home. He fell to felling down,"
400,5,354,"And twenty trees he stoop’d in little space,"
400,5,355,"Plain’d, used his plumb, did all with artful grace."
400,5,356,In mean time did Calypso wimbles bring.
400,5,357,"He bor’d, clos’d, nail’d, and order’d ev’ry thing,"
400,5,358,And look how much a ship - wright will allow
400,5,359,A ship of burden (one that best doth know
400,5,360,"What fits his art) so large a keel he cast,"
400,5,361,"Wrought up her decks, and hatches, side - boards, mast,"
400,5,362,With willow watlings arm’d her to resist
400,5,363,"The billows’ outrage, added all she miss’d,"
400,5,364,"Sail - yards, and stern for guide. The Nymph then brought"
400,5,365,"Linen for sails, which with dispatch he wrought,"
400,5,366,"Gables, and halsters, tacklings. All the frame"
400,5,367,In four days’ space to full perfection came.[3]
400,5,368,"The fifth day, they dismiss’d him from the shore,"
400,5,369,"Weeds neat, and odorous, gave him, victuals store,"
400,5,370,"Wine, strong waters, and a prosp’rous wind,"
400,5,371,"To which, Ulysses, fit - to - be - divin’d,"
400,5,372,"His sails expos’d, and hoiséd. Off he gat;"
400,5,373,"And cheerful was he. At the stern he sat,"
400,5,374,And steer’d right artfully. Nor sleep could seize
400,5,375,His eye - lids. He beheld the Pleiades;
400,5,376,"The Bear, surnam’d the Wain, that round doth move"
400,5,377,"About Orion, and keeps still above"
400,5,378,The billowy ocean; the slow - setting star
400,5,379,"Bootes call’d, by some the Waggoner."
400,5,380,Calypso warn’d him he his course should steer
400,5,381,Still to his left hand. Seventeen days did clear
400,5,382,"The cloudy night’s command in his moist way,"
400,5,383,And by the eighteenth light he might display
400,5,384,"The shady hills of the Phæacian shore,"
400,5,385,"For which, as to his next abode, he bore."
400,5,386,"The country did a pretty figure yield,"
400,5,387,And look’d from off the dark seas like a shield.
400,5,388,"Imperious Neptune, making his retreat"
400,5,389,"From th’ Æthiopian earth, and taking seat"
400,5,390,"Upon the mountains of the Solymi,"
400,5,391,"From thence, far off discov’ring, did descry"
400,5,392,Ulysses his fields ploughing. All on fire
400,5,393,"The sight straight set his heart, and made desire"
400,5,394,"Of wreak run over, it did boil so high."
400,5,395,"When, his head nodding; “O impiety,”"
400,5,396,"He cried out, “now the Gods’ inconstancy"
400,5,397,"Is most apparent, alt’ring their designs"
400,5,398,"Since I the Æthiops saw, and here confines"
400,5,399,To this Ulysses’ fate his misery.
400,5,400,"The great mark, on which all his hopes rely,"
400,5,401,Lies in Phæacia. But I hope he shall
400,5,402,"Feel woe at height, ere that dead calm befall.”"
400,5,403,"This said; he, begging, gather’d clouds from land,[4]"
400,5,404,"Frighted the seas up, snatch’d into his hand"
400,5,405,"His horrid trident, and aloft did toss,"
400,5,406,"Of all the winds, all storms he could engross,"
400,5,407,"All earth took into sea with clouds, grim Night"
400,5,408,"Fell tumbling headlong from the cope of light,"
400,5,409,"The East and South winds justled in the air,"
400,5,410,"The violent Zephyr, and North making - fair,"
400,5,411,Roll’d up the waves before them. And then bent
400,5,412,"Ulysses’ knees, then all his spirit was spent."
400,5,413,"In which despair, he thus spake: “Woe is me!"
400,5,414,"What was I born to, man of misery!"
400,5,415,"Fear tells me now, that, all the Goddess said,"
400,5,416,"Truth’s self will author, that Fate would be paid"
400,5,417,"Grief’s whole sum due from me, at sea, before"
400,5,418,I reach’d the dear touch of my country’s shore.
400,5,419,With what clouds Jove heav’n’s heighten’d forehead binds!
400,5,420,How tyrannize the wraths of all the winds!
400,5,421,"How all the tops he bottoms with the deeps,"
400,5,422,And in the bottoms all the tops he steeps!
400,5,423,Thus dreadful is the presence of our death.
400,5,424,Thrice four times blest were they that sunk beneath
400,5,425,"Their fates at Troy, and did to nought contend"
400,5,426,But to renown Atrides with their end!
400,5,427,"I would to God, my hour of death and fate"
400,5,428,"That day had held the’ pow’r to terminate,"
400,5,429,When show’rs of darts my life bore undepress’d
400,5,430,About divine Æacides deceas’d!
400,5,431,"Then had I been allotted to have died,"
400,5,432,"By all the Greeks with fun’rals glorified,"
400,5,433,"(Whence death, encouraging good life, had grown)"
400,5,434,"Where now I die, by no man mourn’d nor known.”"
400,5,435,"This spoke, a huge wave took him by the head,"
400,5,436,And hurl’d him o’er board; ship and all it laid
400,5,437,"Inverted quite amidst the waves, but he"
400,5,438,"Far off from her sprawl’d, strow’d about the sea,"
400,5,439,"His stern still holding broken off, his mast"
400,5,440,"Burst in the midst, so horrible a blast"
400,5,441,Of mix’d winds struck it. Sails and sail - yards fell
400,5,442,Amongst the billows; and himself did dwell
400,5,443,"A long time under water, nor could get"
400,5,444,"In haste his head out, wave with wave so met"
400,5,445,"In his depression; and his garments too,"
400,5,446,"Giv’n by Calypso, gave him much to do,"
400,5,447,Hind’ring his swimming; yet he left not so
400,5,448,"His drenchéd vessel, for the overthrow"
400,5,449,"Of her nor him, but gat at length again,"
400,5,450,"Wrastling with Neptune, hold of her; and then"
400,5,451,"Sat in her bulk, insulting over death,"
400,5,452,"Which, with the salt stream prest to stop his breath,"
400,5,453,"He ’scap’d, and gave the sea again to give"
400,5,454,"To other men. His ship so striv’d to live,"
400,5,455,"Floating at random, cuff’d from wave to wave."
400,5,456,As you have seen the North wind when he drave
400,5,457,In autumn heaps of thorn - fed grasshoppers
400,5,458,"Hither and thither, one heap this way bears,"
400,5,459,"Another that, and makes them often meet"
400,5,460,in his confus’d gales; so Ulysses’ fleet
400,5,461,The winds hurl’d up and down; now Boreas
400,5,462,"Toss’d it to Notus, Notus gave it pass"
400,5,463,"To Eurus, Eurus Zephyr made pursue"
400,5,464,The horrid tennis. This sport call’d the view
400,5,465,"Of Cadmus’ daughter, with the narrow heel,"
400,5,466,"Ino Leucothea, that first did feel"
400,5,467,"A mortal dame’s desires, and had a tongue,"
400,5,468,But now had th’ honour to be nam’d among
400,5,469,The marine Godheads. She with pity saw
400,5,470,"Ulysses justled thus from flaw to flaw,"
400,5,471,"And, like a cormorant in form and flight,"
400,5,472,"Rose from a whirl - pool, on the ship did light,"
400,5,473,And thus bespake him: “Why is Neptune thus
400,5,474,"In thy pursuit extremely furious,"
400,5,475,"Oppressing thee with such a world of ill,"
400,5,476,"Ev’n to thy death? He must not serve his will,"
400,5,477,Though ’tis his study. Let me then advise
400,5,478,As my thoughts serve; thou shalt not be unwise
400,5,479,To leave thy weeds and ship to the commands
400,5,480,"Of these rude winds, and work out with thy hands"
400,5,481,"Pass to Phæacia, where thy austere Fate"
400,5,482,Is to pursue thee with no more such hate.
400,5,483,"Take here this tablet, with this riband strung,"
400,5,484,And see it still about thy bosom hung;
400,5,485,By whose eternal virtue never fear
400,5,486,"To suffer thus again, nor perish here."
400,5,487,"But when thou touchest with thy hand the shore,"
400,5,488,"Then take it from thy neck, nor wear it more,"
400,5,489,"But cast it far off from the continent,"
400,5,490,And then thy person far ashore present.
400,5,491,"Thus gave she him the tablet; and again,"
400,5,492,"Turn’d to a cormorant, div’d, past sight, the main."
400,5,493,"Patient Ulysses sigh’d at this, and stuck"
400,5,494,"In the conceit of such fair - spoken luck,"
400,5,495,"And said: “Alas! I must suspect ev’n this,"
400,5,496,Lest any other of the Deities
400,5,497,"Add sleight to Neptune’s force, to counsel me"
400,5,498,"To leave my vessel, and so far off see"
400,5,499,The shore I aim at. Not with thoughts too clear
400,5,500,"Will I obey her, but to me appear"
400,5,501,These counsels best: As long as I perceive
400,5,502,"My ship not quite dissolv’d, I will not leave"
400,5,503,"The help she may afford me, but abide,"
400,5,504,And suffer all woes till the worst be tried.
400,5,505,"When she is split, I’ll swim. No miracle can,"
400,5,506,"Past near and clear means, move a knowing man.”"
400,5,507,"While this discourse employ’d him, Neptune rais’d"
400,5,508,"A huge, a high, and horrid sea, that seiz’d"
400,5,509,"Him and his ship, and toss’d them through the lake."
400,5,510,As when the violent winds together take
400,5,511,"Heaps of dry chaff, and hurl them ev’ry way;"
400,5,512,So his long wood - stack Neptune strook astray
400,5,513,"Then did Ulysses mount on rib, perforce,"
400,5,514,"Like to a rider of a running horse,"
400,5,515,"To stay himself a time, while he might shift"
400,5,516,"His drenched weeds, that were Calypso’s gift."
400,5,517,When putting straight Leucothea’s amulet
400,5,518,"About his neck, he all his forces set"
400,5,519,"To swim, and cast him prostrate to the seas."
400,5,520,When pow’rful Neptune saw the ruthless prease
400,5,521,"Of perils siege him thus, he mov’d his head,"
400,5,522,And this betwixt him and his heart he said:
400,5,523,"“So, now feel ills enow, and struggle so,"
400,5,524,Till to your Jove - lov’d islanders you row.
400,5,525,"But my mind says, you will not so avoid"
400,5,526,"This last task too, but be with suff’rance cloy’d.”"
400,5,527,"This said, his rich - man’d horse he mov’d, and reach’d"
400,5,528,His house at Ægas. But Minerva fetch’d
400,5,529,"The winds from sea, and all their ways but one"
400,5,530,Barr’d to their passage; the bleak North alone
400,5,531,"She set to blow, the rest she charg’d to keep"
400,5,532,"Their rages in, and bind themselves in sleep."
400,5,533,"But Boreas still flew high to break the seas,"
400,5,534,Till Jove - bred Ithacus the more with ease
400,5,535,The navigation - skill’d Phæacian states
400,5,536,"Might make his refuge, Death and angry Fates"
400,5,537,"At length escaping. Two nights, yet, and days"
400,5,538,He spent in wrastling with the sable seas;
400,5,539,"In which space, often did his heart propose"
400,5,540,"Death to his eyes. But when Aurora rose,"
400,5,541,"And threw the third light from her orient hair,"
400,5,542,"The winds grew calm, and clear was all the air,"
400,5,543,"Not one breath stirring. Then he might descry,"
400,5,544,"Rais’d by the high seas, clear, and land was nigh."
400,5,545,"And then, look how to good sons that esteem"
400,5,546,"Their father’s life dear, (after pains extreme,"
400,5,547,"Felt in some sickness, that hath held him long"
400,5,548,"Down to his bed, and with affections strong"
400,5,549,"Wasted his body, made his life his load,"
400,5,550,As being inflicted by some angry God)
400,5,551,When on their pray’rs they see descend at length
400,5,552,"Health from the heav’ns, clad all in spirit and strength,"
400,5,553,"The sight is precious; so, since here should end"
400,5,554,"Ulysses’ toils, which therein should extend"
400,5,555,"Health to his country, held to him his sire"
400,5,556,"And on which long for him disease did tire,"
400,5,557,"And then, besides, for his own sake to see"
400,5,558,"The shores, the woods so near, such joy had he,"
400,5,559,As those good sons for their recover’d sire.
400,5,560,Then labour’d feet and all parts to aspire
400,5,561,To that wish’d continent; which when as near
400,5,562,"He came, as Clamour might inform an ear,"
400,5,563,"He heard a sound beat from the sea - bred rocks,"
400,5,564,"Against which gave a huge sea horrid shocks,"
400,5,565,"That belch’d upon the firm land weeds and foam,"
400,5,566,"With which were all things hid there, where no room"
400,5,567,"Of fit capacity was for any port,"
400,5,568,"Nor from the sea for any man’s resort,"
400,5,569,"The shores, the rocks, the cliff’s, so prominent were."
400,5,570,"“O,” said Ulysses then, “now Jupiter"
400,5,571,"Hath giv’n me sight of an unhop’d for shore,"
400,5,572,"Though I have wrought these seas so long, so sore."
400,5,573,"Of rest yet no place shows the slend’rest prints,"
400,5,574,"The rugged shore so bristled is with flints,"
400,5,575,"Against which ev’ry way the waves so flock,"
400,5,576,"And all the shore shows as one eminent rock,"
400,5,577,"So near which ’tis so deep, that not a sand"
400,5,578,"Is there for any tired foot to stand,"
400,5,579,"Nor fly his death - fast - following miseries,"
400,5,580,"Lest, if he land, upon him foreright flies"
400,5,581,"A churlish wave, to crush him ’gainst a cliff,"
400,5,582,Worse than vain rend’ring all his landing strife.
400,5,583,"And should I swim to seek a hav’n elsewhere,"
400,5,584,"Or land less way - beat, I may justly fear"
400,5,585,"I shall be taken with a gale again,"
400,5,586,And cast a huge way off into the main;
400,5,587,And there the great Earth - shaker (having seen
400,5,588,"My so near landing, and again his spleen"
400,5,589,"Forcing me to him) will some whale send out,"
400,5,590,(Of which a horrid number here about
400,5,591,His Amphitrite breeds) to swallow me.
400,5,592,"I well have prov’d, with what malignity"
400,5,593,"He treads my steps.” While this discourse he held,"
400,5,594,A curs’d surge ’gainst a cutting rock impell’d
400,5,595,"His naked body, which it gash’d and tore,"
400,5,596,"And had his bones broke, if but one sea more"
400,5,597,"Had cast him on it. But She prompted him,"
400,5,598,"That never fail’d, and bade him no more swim"
400,5,599,"Still off and on, but boldly force the shore,"
400,5,600,And hug the rock that him so rudely tore;
400,5,601,"Which he with both hands sigh’d and clasp’d, till past"
400,5,602,"The billow’s rage was; when ’scap’d, back so fast"
400,5,603,"The rock repuls’d it, that it reft his hold,"
400,5,604,"Sucking him from it, and far back he roll’d"
400,5,605,And as the polypus that (forc’d from home
400,5,606,"Amidst the soft sea, and near rough land come"
400,5,607,For shelter ’gainst the storms that beat on her
400,5,608,"At open sea, as she abroad doth err)"
400,5,609,"A deal of gravel, and sharp little stones,"
400,5,610,Needfully gathers in her hollow bones;
400,5,611,"So he forc’d hither by the sharper ill,"
400,5,612,"Shunning the smoother, where he best hop’d, still"
400,5,613,"The worst succeeded; for the cruel friend,"
400,5,614,"To which he cling’d for succour, off did rend"
400,5,615,From his broad hands the soaken flesh so sore
400,5,616,"That off he fell, and could sustain no more."
400,5,617,"Quite under water fell he; and, past fate,"
400,5,618,Hapless Ulysses there had lost the state
400,5,619,"He held in life, if, still the grey - eyed Maid"
400,5,620,"His wisdom prompting, he had not assay’d"
400,5,621,"Another course, and ceas’d t’ attempt that shore,"
400,5,622,"Swimming, and casting round his eye t’ explore"
400,5,623,Some other shelter. Then the mouth he found
400,5,624,"Of fair Callicoe’s flood, whose shores were crown’d"
400,5,625,With most apt succours: rocks so smooth they seem’d
400,5,626,Polish’d of purpose; land that quite redeem’d
400,5,627,With breathless coverts th’ others’ blasted shores.
400,5,628,"The flood he knew, and thus in heart implores:"
400,5,629,"“King of this river, hear! Whatever name"
400,5,630,"Makes thee invok’d, to thee I humbly frame"
400,5,631,My flight from Neptune’s furies. Rev’rend is
400,5,632,To all the ever - living Deities
400,5,633,What erring man soever seeks their aid.
400,5,634,To thy both flood and knees a man dismay’d
400,5,635,With varied suff’rance sues. Yield then some rest
400,5,636,To him that is thy suppliant profest.”
400,5,637,"This, though but spoke in thought, the Godhead heard,"
400,5,638,"Her current straight stay’d, and her thick waves clear’d"
400,5,639,"Before him, smooth’d her waters, and, just where"
400,5,640,"He pray’d half - drown’d, entirely sav’d him there."
400,5,641,"Then forth he came, his both knees falt’ring, both"
400,5,642,"His strong hands hanging down, and all with froth"
400,5,643,"His cheeks and nosthrils flowing, voice and breath"
400,5,644,"Spent to all use, and down he sunk to death."
400,5,645,The sea had soak’d his heart through; all his veins
400,5,646,His toils had rack’d t’ a labouring woman’s pains.[5]
400,5,647,Dead weary was he. But when breath did find
400,5,648,"A pass reciprocal, and in his mind"
400,5,649,"His spirit was recollected, up he rose,"
400,5,650,"And from his neck did th’ amulet unloose,"
400,5,651,That Ino gave him; which he hurl’d from him
400,5,652,"To sea. It sounding fell, and back did swim"
400,5,653,"With th’ ebbing waters, till it straight arriv’d"
400,5,654,Where Ino’s fair hand it again receiv’d.
400,5,655,"Then kiss’d he th’ humble earth; and on he goes,"
400,5,656,"Till bulrushes show’d place for his repose,"
400,5,657,"Where laid, he sigh’d, and thus said to his soul:"
400,5,658,"“O me, what strange perplexities control"
400,5,659,The whole skill of thy pow’rs in this event!
400,5,660,What feel I? If till care - nurse night be spent
400,5,661,"I watch amidst the flood, the sea’s chill breath,"
400,5,662,"And vegetant dews, I fear will be my death,"
400,5,663,So low brought with my labours. Towards day
400,5,664,A passing sharp air ever breathes at sea.
400,5,665,"If I the pitch of this next mountain scale,"
400,5,666,"And shady wood, and in some thicket fall"
400,5,667,"Into the hands of Sleep, though there the cold"
400,5,668,"May well be check’d, and healthful slumbers hold"
400,5,669,"Her sweet hand on my pow’rs, all care allay’d,"
400,5,670,Yet there will beasts devour me. Best appaid
400,5,671,"Doth that course make me yet; for there, some strife,"
400,5,672,"Strength, and my spirit, may make me make for life;"
400,5,673,"Which, though impair’d, may yet be fresh applied,"
400,5,674,Where peril possible of escape is tried.
400,5,675,"But he that fights with heav’n, or with the sea,"
400,5,676,To indiscretion adds impiety.”
400,5,677,Thus to the woods he hasted; which he found
400,5,678,"Not far from sea, but on far - seeing ground,"
400,5,679,"Where two twin underwoods he enter’d on,"
400,5,680,With olive - trees and oil - trees overgrown;
400,5,681,Through which the moist force of the loud - voic’d wind
400,5,682,"Did never beat, nor ever Phœbus shin’d,"
400,5,683,"Nor show’r beat through, they grew so one in one,"
400,5,684,"And had, by turns, their pow’r t’ exclude the sun."
400,5,685,Here enter’d our Ulysses; and a bed
400,5,686,"Of leaves huge, and of huge abundance, spread"
400,5,687,"With all his speed. Large he made it, for there"
400,5,688,"For two or three men ample cov’rings were,"
400,5,689,"Such as might shield them from the winter’s worst,"
400,5,690,"Though steel it breathed, and blew as it would burst.[6]"
400,5,691,"Patient Ulysses joy’d, that ever day"
400,5,692,"Show’d such a shelter. In the midst he lay,"
400,5,693,Store of leaves heaping high on ev’ry side.
400,5,694,And as in some out - field a man doth hide
400,5,695,"A kindled brand, to keep the seed of fire,"
400,5,696,"No neighbour dwelling near, and his desire"
400,5,697,"Serv’d with self store, he else would ask of none,"
400,5,698,But of his fore - spent sparks rakes th’ ashes on;
400,5,699,"So this out - place Ulysses thus receives,"
400,5,700,And thus nak’d virtue’s seed lies hid in leaves.
400,5,701,Yet Pallas made him sleep as soon as men
400,5,702,"Whom delicacies all their flatt’ries deign,"
400,5,703,And all that all his labours could comprise
400,5,704,Quickly concluded in his closed eyes.

400,6,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,6,2,Minerva in a vision stands
400,6,3,Before Nausicaa: and commands
400,6,4,She to the flood her weeds should bear;
400,6,5,For now her nuptial day was near.
400,6,6,"Nausicaa her charge obeys,"
400,6,7,And then with other virgins plays.
400,6,8,Their sports make wak’d Ulysses rise;
400,6,9,"Walk to them, and beseech supplies"
400,6,10,Of food and clothes. His naked sight
400,6,11,"Puts th’ other maids, afraid, to flight;"
400,6,12,"Nausicaa only boldly stays,"
400,6,13,And gladly his desire obeys.
400,6,14,"He, furnish’d with her favour’s shown,"
400,6,15,Attends her and the rest to town.
400,6,16,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,6,17,_Ζη̑τα._
400,6,18,Here olive leaves
400,6,19,"T’ hide shame began,"
400,6,20,The maid receives
400,6,21,The naked man.
400,6,22,"The much - sustaining, patient, heav’nly man,"
400,6,23,"Whom Toil and Sleep had worn so weak and wan,[1]"
400,6,24,Thus won his rest. In mean space Pallas went
400,6,25,"To the Phæacian city, and descent"
400,6,26,"That first did broad Hyperia’s lands divide,"
400,6,27,"Near the vast Cyclops, men of monstrous pride,"
400,6,28,"That prey’d on those Hyperians, since they were"
400,6,29,Of greater pow’r; and therefore longer there
400,6,30,"Divine Nausithous dwelt not, but arose,"
400,6,31,And did for Scheria all his pow’rs dispose;
400,6,32,Far from ingenious art - inventing men
400,6,33,"But there did he erect a city then,"
400,6,34,"First drew a wall round, then he houses builds,"
400,6,35,"And then a temple to the Gods, the fields"
400,6,36,"Lastly dividing. But he, stoop’d by Fate,"
400,6,37,Div’d to th’ infernals; and Alcinous sate
400,6,38,"In his command, a man the Gods did teach"
400,6,39,Commanding counsels. His house held the reach
400,6,40,"Of grey Minerva’s project, to provide"
400,6,41,That great - soul’d Ithacus might be supplied
400,6,42,With all things fitting his return. She went
400,6,43,"Up to the chamber, where the fair descent"
400,6,44,"Of great Alcinous slept; a maid, whose parts"
400,6,45,In wit and beauty wore divine deserts.
400,6,46,Well - deck’d her chamber was; of which the door
400,6,47,"Did seem to lighten, such a gloss it bore"
400,6,48,"Betwixt the posts, and now flew ope to find"
400,6,49,The Goddess entry. Like a puft of wind
400,6,50,She reach’d the virgin bed; neat which there lay
400,6,51,"Two maids, to whom the Graces did convey"
400,6,52,Figure and manners. But above the head
400,6,53,Of bright Nausicaa did Pallas tread
400,6,54,"The subtle air, and put the person on"
400,6,55,"Of Dymas’ daughter, from comparison"
400,6,56,Exempt in business naval. Like his seed
400,6,57,Minerva look’d now; whom one year did breed[2]
400,6,58,"With bright Nausicaa, and who had gain’d"
400,6,59,"Grace in her love, yet on her thus complain’d:"
400,6,60,“Nausicaa! Why bred thy mother one
400,6,61,So negligent in rites so stood upon
400,6,62,By other virgins? Thy fair garments lie
400,6,63,"Neglected by thee, yet thy nuptials nigh;"
400,6,64,"When rich in all attire both thou shouldst be,"
400,6,65,"And garments give to others honouring thee,"
400,6,66,That lead thee to the temple. Thy good name
400,6,67,Grows amongst men for these things; they inflame
400,6,68,Father and rev’rend mother with delight.
400,6,69,"Come, when the Day takes any wink from Night,"
400,6,70,"Let’s to the river, and repurify"
400,6,71,Thy wedding garments. My society
400,6,72,"Shall freely serve thee for thy speedier aid,"
400,6,73,Because thou shalt no mote stand on the maid.
400,6,74,"The best of all Phæacia woo thy grace,"
400,6,75,"Where thou wert bred, and ow’st thyself a race."
400,6,76,"Up, and stir up to thee thy honour’d sire,"
400,6,77,"To give thee mules and coach, thee and thy tire,"
400,6,78,"Veils, girdles, mantles, early to the flood"
400,6,79,"To bear in state. It suits thy high - born blood,"
400,6,80,"And far more fits thee, than to foot so far,"
400,6,81,For far from town thou know’st the bath - founts are.”
400,6,82,"This said, away blue - eyed Minerva went"
400,6,83,"Up to Olympus, the firm continent"
400,6,84,"That bears in endless being the Deified kind,"
400,6,85,"That’s neither sous’d with show’rs, nor shook with wind,"
400,6,86,"Nor chill’d with snow, but where Serenity flies"
400,6,87,"Exempt from clouds, and ever - beamy skies"
400,6,88,"Circle the glitt’ring hill, and all their days"
400,6,89,Give the delights of blesséd Deity praise.
400,6,90,"And hither Pallas flew, and left the maid,"
400,6,91,When she had all that might excite her said.
400,6,92,"Straight rose the lovely Morn, that up did raise"
400,6,93,"Fair - veil’d Nausicaa, whose dream her praise"
400,6,94,To admiration took; who no time spent
400,6,95,To give the rapture of her vision vent
400,6,96,"To her lov’d parents, whom she found within."
400,6,97,"Her mother set at fire, who had to spin"
400,6,98,"A rock, whose tincture with sea - purple shin’d;"
400,6,99,Her maids about her. But she chanc’d to find
400,6,100,"Her father going abroad, to council call’d"
400,6,101,By his grave Senate. And to him exhal’d
400,6,102,"Her smother’d bosom was: “Lov’d sire,” said she,[3]"
400,6,103,"“Will you not now command a coach for me,"
400,6,104,"Stately and cómplete, fit for me to bear"
400,6,105,To wash at flood the weeds I cannot wear
400,6,106,Before repurified? Yourself it fits
400,6,107,"To wear fair weeds, as ev’ry man that sits"
400,6,108,"In place of council. And five sons you have,"
400,6,109,"Two wed, three bachelors, that must be brave"
400,6,110,"In ev’ry day’s shift, that they may go dance;"
400,6,111,For these three last with these things must advance
400,6,112,"Their states in marriage, and who else but I,"
400,6,113,"Their sister, should their dancing rites supply?”"
400,6,114,"This gen’ral cause she show’d, and would not name"
400,6,115,"Her mind of nuptials to her sire, for shame."
400,6,116,"He understood her yet, and thus replied:"
400,6,117,"“Daughter! nor these, nor any grace beside,"
400,6,118,"I either will deny thee, or defer,"
400,6,119,"Mules, nor a coach, of state and circular,"
400,6,120,"Fitting at all parts. Go, my servants shall"
400,6,121,"Serves thy desires, and thy command in all.”"
400,6,122,"The servants then commanded soon obey’d,"
400,6,123,"Fetch’d coach, and mules join’d in it. Then the Maid"
400,6,124,"Brought from the chamber her rich weeds, and laid"
400,6,125,All up in coach; in which her mother plac’d
400,6,126,"A maund of victuals, varied well in taste,"
400,6,127,And other junkets. Wine she likewise fill’d
400,6,128,"Within a goat - skin bottle, and distill’d"
400,6,129,"Sweet and moist oil into a golden cruse,"
400,6,130,"Both for her daughter’s, and her handmaid’s, use,"
400,6,131,"To soften their bright bodies, when they rose"
400,6,132,Cleans’d from their cold baths. Up to coach then goes
400,6,133,"Th’ observéd Maid, takes both the scourge and reins,"
400,6,134,And to her side her handmaid straight attains.
400,6,135,"Nor these alone, but other virgins, grac’d"
400,6,136,"The nuptial chariot. The whole bevy plac’d,"
400,6,137,"Nausicaa scourg’d to make the coach - mules run,"
400,6,138,"That neigh’d, and pac’d their usual speed, and soon"
400,6,139,"Both maids and weeds brought to the river - side,"
400,6,140,"Where baths for all the year their use supplied,"
400,6,141,"Whose waters were so pure they would not stain,"
400,6,142,"But still ran fair forth, and did more remain"
400,6,143,"Apt to purge stains, for that purg’d stain within,"
400,6,144,Which by the water’s pure store was not seen.
400,6,145,"These, here arriv’d, the mules uncoach’d, and drave"
400,6,146,"Up to the gulfy river’s shore, that gave"
400,6,147,Sweet grass to them. The maids from coach then took
400,6,148,"Their clothes, and steep’d them in the sable brook:"
400,6,149,"Then put them into springs, and trod them clean"
400,6,150,With cleanly feet; adventuring wagers then
400,6,151,Who should have soonest and most cleanly done.
400,6,152,"When having thoroughly cleans’d, they spread them on"
400,6,153,"The flood’s shore, all in order. And then, where"
400,6,154,"The waves the pebbles wash’d, and ground was clear,"
400,6,155,"They bath’d themselves, and all with glitt’ring oil"
400,6,156,Smooth’d their white skins; refreshing then their toil
400,6,157,"With pleasant dinner, by the river - side;"
400,6,158,Yet still watch’d when the sun their clothes had dried.
400,6,159,"Till which time, having din’d, Nausicaa"
400,6,160,"With other virgins did at stool - ball play,"
400,6,161,Their shoulder - reaching head - tires laying by.
400,6,162,"Nausicaa, with the wrists of ivory,"
400,6,163,"The liking stroke struck, singing first a song,"
400,6,164,"As custom order’d, and amidst the throng"
400,6,165,"Made such a show, and so past all was seen,"
400,6,166,"As when the chaste - born, arrow - loving, Queen,"
400,6,167,"Along the mountains gliding, either over"
400,6,168,"Spartan Taygetus, whose tops far discover,"
400,6,169,"Or Eurymanthus, in the wild boar’s chace,"
400,6,170,"Or swift - hov’d hart, and with her Jove’s fair race,"
400,6,171,"The field Nymphs, sporting; amongst whom, to see"
400,6,172,"How far Diana had priority,"
400,6,173,"Though all were fair, for fairness yet of all,"
400,6,174,"As both by head and forehead being more tall,"
400,6,175,"Latona triumph’d, since the dullest sight"
400,6,176,Might eas’ly judge whom her pains brought to light;
400,6,177,"Nausicaa so, whom never husband tam’d,"
400,6,178,Above them all in all the beauties flam’d.
400,6,179,"But when they now made homewards, and array’d,"
400,6,180,"Ord’ring their weeds disorder’d as they play’d,"
400,6,181,"Mules and coach ready, then Minerva thought"
400,6,182,"What means to wake Ulysses might be wrought,"
400,6,183,"That he might see this lovely - sighted maid,"
400,6,184,"Whom she intended should become his aid,"
400,6,185,"Bring him to town, and his return advance."
400,6,186,"Her mean was this, though thought a stool - ball chance:[4]"
400,6,187,"The queen now, for the upstroke, struck the ball"
400,6,188,"Quite wide off th’ other maids, and made it fall"
400,6,189,"Amidst the whirlpools. At which out shriek’d all,"
400,6,190,And with the shriek did wise Ulysses wake;
400,6,191,"Who, sitting up, was doubtful who should make"
400,6,192,"That sudden outcry, and in mind thus striv’d:"
400,6,193,“On what a people am I now arriv’d?
400,6,194,"At civil hospitable men, that fear"
400,6,195,The Gods? Or dwell injurious mortals here?
400,6,196,"Unjust, and churlish? Like the female cry"
400,6,197,Of youth it sounds. What are they? Nymphs bred high
400,6,198,"On tops of hills, or in the founts of floods,"
400,6,199,"In herby marshes, or in leafy woods?"
400,6,200,Or are they high - spoke men I now am near?
400,6,201,"I’ll prove, and see.” With this, the wary peer"
400,6,202,"Crept forth the thicket, and an olive bough"
400,6,203,"Broke with his broad hand, which he did bestow"
400,6,204,"In covert of his nakedness, and then"
400,6,205,Put hasty head out. Look how from his den
400,6,206,"A mountain lion looks, that, all embrued"
400,6,207,"With drops of trees, and weather - beaten - hued,"
400,6,208,"Bold of his strength, goes on, and in his eye"
400,6,209,"A burning furnace glows, all bent to prey"
400,6,210,"On sheep, or oxen, or the upland hart,"
400,6,211,"His belly charging him, and he must part"
400,6,212,"Stakes with the herdsman in his beasts’ attempt,"
400,6,213,Ev’n where from rape their strengths are most exempt;
400,6,214,"So wet, so weather - beat, so stung with need,"
400,6,215,Ev’n to the home - fields of the country’s breed
400,6,216,"Ulysses was to force forth his access,"
400,6,217,Though merely naked; and his sight did press
400,6,218,The eyes of soft - hair’d virgins. Horrid was
400,6,219,His rough appearance to them; the hard pass
400,6,220,He had at sea stuck by him. All in flight
400,6,221,"The virgins scatter’d, frighted with this sight,"
400,6,222,About the prominent windings of the flood.
400,6,223,"All but Nausicaa fled; but she fast stood,"
400,6,224,"Pallas had put a boldness in her breast,"
400,6,225,And in her fair limbs tender fear comprest.
400,6,226,"And still she stood him, as resolv’d to know"
400,6,227,"What man he was, or out of what should grow"
400,6,228,His strange repair to them. And here was he
400,6,229,Put to his wisdom; if her virgin knee
400,6,230,"He should be bold, but kneeling, to embrace,"
400,6,231,"Or keep aloof, and try with words of grace,"
400,6,232,"In humblest suppliance, if he might obtain"
400,6,233,"Some cover for his nakedness, and gain"
400,6,234,Her grace to show and guide him to the town.
400,6,235,"The last he best thought, to be worth his own,"
400,6,236,"In weighing both well; to keep still aloof,"
400,6,237,"And give with soft words his desires their proof,"
400,6,238,"Lest, pressing so near as to touch her knee,"
400,6,239,He might incense her maiden modesty.
400,6,240,This fair and fil’d speech then shew’d this was he:
400,6,241,"“Let me beseech, O queen, this truth of thee,"
400,6,242,"Are you of mortal, or the defied, race?"
400,6,243,"If of the Gods, that th’ ample heav’ns embrace,"
400,6,244,I can resemble you to none above
400,6,245,"So near as to the chaste - born birth of Jove,"
400,6,246,"The beamy Cynthia. Her you full present,"
400,6,247,"In grace of ev’ry God - like lineament,"
400,6,248,"Her goodly magnitude, and all th’ address"
400,6,249,You promise of her very perfectness.
400,6,250,"If sprung of humans, that inhabit earth,"
400,6,251,"Thrice blest are both the authors of your birth,"
400,6,252,"Thrice blest your brothers, that in your deserts"
400,6,253,"Must, ev’n to rapture, bear delighted hearts,"
400,6,254,"To see, so like the first trim of a tree,"
400,6,255,"Your form adorn a dance. But most blest he,"
400,6,256,"Of all that breathe, that hath the gift t’ engage"
400,6,257,"Your bright neck in the yoke of marriage,"
400,6,258,And deck his house with your commanding merit
400,6,259,"I have not seen a man of so much spirit,"
400,6,260,"Nor man, nor woman, I did ever see,"
400,6,261,At all parts equal to the parts in thee.
400,6,262,"T’ enjoy your sight, doth admiration seize"
400,6,263,"My eyes, and apprehensive faculties."
400,6,264,Lately in Delos (with a charge of men
400,6,265,"Arriv’d, that render’d me most wretched then,"
400,6,266,Now making me thus naked) I beheld
400,6,267,"The burthen of a palm, whose issue swell’d"
400,6,268,"About Apollo’s fane, and that put on"
400,6,269,A grace like thee; for Earth had never none
400,6,270,Of all her sylvan issue so adorn’d.
400,6,271,"Into amaze my very soul was turn’d,"
400,6,272,To give it observation; as now thee
400,6,273,"To view, O virgin, a stupidity"
400,6,274,"Past admiration strikes me, join’d with fear"
400,6,275,"To do a suppliant’s due, and press so near,"
400,6,276,"As to embrace thy knees. Nor is it strange,"
400,6,277,For one of fresh and firmest spirit would change
400,6,278,"T’ embrace so bright an object. But, for me,"
400,6,279,A cruel habit of calamity
400,6,280,Prepar’d the strong impression thou hast made;
400,6,281,For this last day did fly night’s twentieth shade
400,6,282,"Since I, at length, escap’d the sable seas;"
400,6,283,When in the mean time th’ unrelenting prease
400,6,284,"Of waves and stern storms toss’d me up and down,"
400,6,285,From th’ isle Ogygia. And now God hath thrown
400,6,286,"My wrack on this shore, that perhaps I may"
400,6,287,"My mis’ries vary here; for yet their stay,"
400,6,288,"I fear, Heav’n hath not order’d, though, before"
400,6,289,"These late afflictions, it hath lent me store."
400,6,290,"O queen, deign pity then, since first to you"
400,6,291,My fate importunes my distress to vow.
400,6,292,"No other dame, nor man, that this Earth own,"
400,6,293,"And neighbour city, I have seen or known."
400,6,294,The town then show me; give my nakedness
400,6,295,"Some shroud to shelter it, if to these seas"
400,6,296,Linen or woollen you have brought to cleanse.
400,6,297,"God give you, in requital, all th’ amends"
400,6,298,"Your heart can wish, a husband, family,"
400,6,299,And good agreement. Nought beneath the sky
400,6,300,"More sweet, more worthy is, than firm consent"
400,6,301,Of man and wife in household government.
400,6,302,"It joys their wishers - well, their enemies wounds,"
400,6,303,But to themselves the special good redounds.”
400,6,304,She answer’d: “Stranger! I discern in thee
400,6,305,"Nor sloth, nor folly, reigns; and yet I see"
400,6,306,"Th’ art poor and wretched. In which I conclude,"
400,6,307,That industry nor wisdom make endued
400,6,308,Men with those gifts that make them best to th’ eye;
400,6,309,Jove only orders man’s felicity.
400,6,310,To good and bad his pleasure fashions still
400,6,311,The whole proportion of their good and ill.
400,6,312,"And he, perhaps, hath form’d this plight in thee,"
400,6,313,"Of which thou must be patient, as he free."
400,6,314,"But after all thy wand’rings, since thy way,"
400,6,315,"Both to our earth, and near our city, lay,"
400,6,316,"As being expos’d to our cares to relieve,"
400,6,317,"Weeds, and what else a human hand should give"
400,6,318,"To one so suppliant and tam’d with woe,"
400,6,319,"Thou shalt not want. Our city I will show,"
400,6,320,"And tell our people’s name: This neighbour town,"
400,6,321,"And all this kingdom, the Phæacians own."
400,6,322,"And (since thou seem’dst so fain to know my birth,"
400,6,323,"And mad’st a question, if of heav’n or earth.)"
400,6,324,This earth hath bred me; and my father’s name
400,6,325,"Alcinous is, that in the pow’r and frame"
400,6,326,Of this isle’s rule is supereminent.”
400,6,327,"Thus, passing him, she to the virgins went,"
400,6,328,And said: “Give stay both to your feet and fright.
400,6,329,Why thus disperse ye for a man’s mere sight?
400,6,330,"Esteem you him a Cyclop, that long since"
400,6,331,Made use to prey upon our citizens?
400,6,332,"This man no moist man is, (nor wat’rish thing,[5]"
400,6,333,"That’s ever flitting, ever ravishing"
400,6,334,"All it can compass; and, like it, doth range"
400,6,335,"In rape of women, never stay’d in change)."
400,6,336,"This man is truly manly, wise, and stay’d,[6]"
400,6,337,"In soul more rich the more to sense decay’d,"
400,6,338,"Who nor will do, nor suffer to be done,"
400,6,339,Acts lewd and abject; nor can such a one
400,6,340,"Greet the Phæacians with a mind envíous,"
400,6,341,"Dear to the Gods they are, and he is pious,"
400,6,342,"Besides, divided from the world we are,"
400,6,343,"The out - part of it, billows circular"
400,6,344,The sea revolving round about our shore;
400,6,345,Nor is there any man that enters more
400,6,346,"Than our own countrymen, with what is brought"
400,6,347,"From other countries. This man, minding nought"
400,6,348,"But his relief, a poor unhappy wretch,"
400,6,349,"Wrack’d here, and hath no other land to fetch,"
400,6,350,Him now we must provide for. From Jove come[7]
400,6,351,"All strangers, and the needy of a home,"
400,6,352,"Who any gift, though ne’er so small it be,"
400,6,353,"Esteem as great, and take it gratefully."
400,6,354,"And therefore, virgins, give the stranger food,"
400,6,355,"And wine; and see ye bathe him in the flood,"
400,6,356,Near to some shore to shelter most inclin’d.
400,6,357,"_To cold - bath - bathers hurtful is the wind,_"
400,6,358,"Not only rugged making th’ outward skin,"
400,6,359,But by his thin pow’rs pierceth parts within.
400,6,360,"This said, their flight in a return they set,"
400,6,361,"And did Ulysses with all grace entreat,"
400,6,362,"Show’d him a shore, wind - proof, and full of shade,"
400,6,363,"By him a shirt and utter mantle laid,"
400,6,364,"A golden jug of liquid oil did add,"
400,6,365,"Bad wash, and all things as Nausicaa bad."
400,6,366,Divine Ulysses would not use their aid;
400,6,367,"But thus bespake them: “Ev’ry lovely maid,"
400,6,368,"Let me entreat to stand a little by,[8]"
400,6,369,"That I, alone, the fresh flood may apply"
400,6,370,"To cleanse my bosom of the sea - wrought brine,"
400,6,371,"And then use oil, which long time did not shine"
400,6,372,On my poor shoulders. I’ll not wash in sight
400,6,373,"Of fair - hair’d maidens. I should blush outright,"
400,6,374,To bathe all - bare by such a virgin light.”
400,6,375,"They mov’d, and mus’d a man had so much grace,"
400,6,376,And told their mistress what a man he was.
400,6,377,"He cleans’d his broad soil’d shoulders, back, and head"
400,6,378,"Yet never tam’d, but now had foam and weed"
400,6,379,"Knit in the fair curls. Which dissolv’d, and he"
400,6,380,"Slick’d all with sweet oil, the sweet charity"
400,6,381,The untouch’d virgin show’d in his attire
400,6,382,"He cloth’d him with. Then Pallas put a fire,"
400,6,383,"More than before, into his sparkling eyes,"
400,6,384,His late soil set off with his soon fresh guise.
400,6,385,"His locks, cleans’d, curl’d the more, and match’d, in pow’r"
400,6,386,"To please an eye, the hyacinthian flow’r."
400,6,387,"And as a workman, that can well combine"
400,6,388,"Silver and gold, and make both strive to shine,"
400,6,389,"As being by Vulcan, and Minerva too,"
400,6,390,Taught how far either may be urg’d to go
400,6,391,"In strife of eminence, when work sets forth"
400,6,392,"A worthy soul to bodies of such worth,"
400,6,393,"No thought reproving th’ act, in any place,"
400,6,394,Nor Art no debt to Nature’s liveliest grace;
400,6,395,So Pallas wrought in him a grace as great
400,6,396,"From head to shoulders, and ashore did seat"
400,6,397,His goodly presence. To which such a guise
400,6,398,"He show’d in going, that it ravish’d eyes."
400,6,399,"All which continued, as he sat apart,"
400,6,400,"Nausicaa’s eye struck wonder through her heart,"
400,6,401,"Who thus bespake her consorts: “Hear me, you"
400,6,402,"Fair - wristed virgins! This rare man, I know,"
400,6,403,"Treads not our country - earth, against the will"
400,6,404,Of some God thronéd on th’ Olympian hill.
400,6,405,"He show’d to me, till now, not worth the note,"
400,6,406,But now he looks as he had godhead got.
400,6,407,"I would to heav’n my husband were no worse,"
400,6,408,"And would be call’d no better, but the course"
400,6,409,Of other husbands pleas’d to dwell out here.
400,6,410,Observe and serve him with our utmost cheer.”
400,6,411,"She said, they heard and did. He drunk and eat"
400,6,412,"Like to a harpy, having touch’d no meat"
400,6,413,A long before time. But Nausicaa now
400,6,414,"Thought of the more grace she did lately vow,"
400,6,415,"Had horse to chariot join’d, and up she rose,"
400,6,416,"Up cheer’d her guest, and said: “Guest, now dispose"
400,6,417,"Yourself for town, that I may let you see"
400,6,418,"My father’s court, where all the peers will be"
400,6,419,"Of our Phæacian state. At all parts, then,"
400,6,420,Observe to whom and what place y’ are t’ attain;

400,6,422,Since I suppose you absolutely wise.

400,6,424,"So long, in these maids’ guides, directly bear"
400,6,425,Upon my chariot (I must go before
400,6,426,"For cause that after comes, to which this more"

400,6,428,"Your way to town, whose tow’rs you see ascend[9]"
400,6,429,To such a steepness. On whose either side
400,6,430,"A fair port stands, to which is nothing wide"
400,6,431,An ent’rer’s passage; on whose both hands ride
400,6,432,"Ships in fair harbours; which once past, you win"
400,6,433,The goodly market - place (that circles in
400,6,434,"A fane to Neptune, built of curious stone,"
400,6,435,"And passing ample) where munitión,"
400,6,436,"Gables, and masts, men make, and polish’d oars;"
400,6,437,For the Phæacians are not conquerors
400,6,438,"By bows nor quivers; oars, masts, ships they are"
400,6,439,"With which they plough the sea, and wage their war."
400,6,440,"And now the cause comes why I lead the way,"
400,6,441,"Not taking you to coach: The men, that sway"
400,6,442,"In work of those tools that so fit our state,"
400,6,443,"Are rude mechanicals, that rare and late"
400,6,444,Work in the market - place; and those are they
400,6,445,"Whose bitter tongues I shun, who straight would say"
400,6,446,"(For these vile vulgars are extremely proud,"
400,6,447,"And foully - languag’d) ‘What is he, allow’d"
400,6,448,"To coach it with Nausicaa, so large set,"
400,6,449,And fairly fashion’d? Where were these two met?
400,6,450,He shall be sure her husband. She hath been
400,6,451,"Gadding in some place, and, of foreign men"
400,6,452,"Fitting her fancy, kindly brought him home"
400,6,453,"In her own ship. He must, of force, be come"
400,6,454,From some far region; we have no such man.
400,6,455,"It may be, praying hard, when her heart ran"
400,6,456,"On some wish’d husband, out of heav’n some God"
400,6,457,Dropp’d in her lap; and there lies she at road
400,6,458,"Her cómplete life time. But, in sooth, if she,"
400,6,459,"Ranging abroad, a husband, such as he"
400,6,460,"Whom now we saw, laid hand on, she was wise,"
400,6,461,For none of all our nobles are of prize
400,6,462,"Enough for her; he must beyond sea come,"
400,6,463,"That wins her high mind, and will have her home."
400,6,464,"Of our peers many have importun’d her,"
400,6,465,Yet she will none.’ Thus these folks will confer
400,6,466,"Behind my back; or, meeting, to my face"
400,6,467,The foul - mouth rout dare put home this disgrace;
400,6,468,"And this would be reproaches to my fame,"
400,6,469,"For, ev’n myself just anger would inflame,"
400,6,470,"If any other virgin I should see,"
400,6,471,"Her parents living, keep the company"
400,6,472,"Of any man to any end of love,"
400,6,473,Till open nuptials should her act approve.
400,6,474,"And therefore hear me, guest, and take such way,"
400,6,475,"That you yourself may compass, in your stay,"
400,6,476,"Your quick deduction by my father’s grace,"
400,6,477,And means to reach the root of all your race.
400,6,478,"We shall, not far out of our way to town,"
400,6,479,"A never - fell’d grove find, that poplars crown,"
400,6,480,"To Pallas sacred, where a fountain flows,"
400,6,481,"And round about the grove a meadow grows,"
400,6,482,"In which my father holds a manor - house,"
400,6,483,"Deck’d all with orchards, green, and odorous,"
400,6,484,As far from town as one may hear a shout.
400,6,485,"There stay, and rest your foot - pains, till full out"
400,6,486,"We reach the city; where, when you may guess"
400,6,487,"We are arriv’d, and enter our access"
400,6,488,"Within my father’s court, then put you on"
400,6,489,"For our Phæacian state, where, to be shown"
400,6,490,"My father’s house, desire. Each infant there"
400,6,491,Can bring you to it; and yourself will clear
400,6,492,"Distinguish it from others, for no shows"
400,6,493,The city - buildings make compar’d with those
400,6,494,That king Alcinous’ seat doth celebrate.
400,6,495,"In whose roofs, and the court (where men of state,"
400,6,496,"And suitors sit and stay) when you shall hide,"
400,6,497,"Straight pass it, ent’ring further, where abide"
400,6,498,"My mother, with her withdrawn housewif’ries,"
400,6,499,"Who still sits in the fire - shine, and applies"
400,6,500,"Her rock, all - purple, and of pompous show,"
400,6,501,"Her chair plac’d ’gainst a pillar, all - a - row"
400,6,502,Her maids behind her set; and to her here
400,6,503,"My father’s dining - throne looks, seated where"
400,6,504,"He pours his choice of wine in, like a God."
400,6,505,"This view once past, for th’ end of your abode,"
400,6,506,"Address suit to my mother, that her mean"
400,6,507,"May make the day of your redition seen,"
400,6,508,"And you may frolic straight, though far away"
400,6,509,You are in distance from your wishéd stay.
400,6,510,"For, if she once be won to wish you well,"
400,6,511,"Your hope may instantly your passport seal,"
400,6,512,"And thenceforth sure abide to see your friends,"
400,6,513,"Fair house, and all to which your heart contends.”"
400,6,514,"This said, she us’d her shining scourge, and lash’d"
400,6,515,"Her mules, that soon the shore left where she wash’d,"
400,6,516,"And, knowing well the way, their pace was fleet,"
400,6,517,And thick they gather’d up their nimble feet.
400,6,518,"Which yet she temper’d so, and us’d her scourge[10]"
400,6,519,"With so much skill, as not to over - urge"
400,6,520,"The foot behind, and make them straggle so"
400,6,521,From close society. Firm together go
400,6,522,Ulysses and her maids. And now the sun
400,6,523,"Sunk to the waters, when they all had won"
400,6,524,"The never - fell’d, and sound - exciting, wood,"
400,6,525,Sacred to Pallas; where the god - like good
400,6,526,"Ulysses rested, and to Pallas pray’d:"
400,6,527,"“Hear me, of goat - kept Jove th’ unconquer’d Maid![11]"
400,6,528,"Now throughly hear me, since, in all the time"
400,6,529,"Of all my wrack, my pray’rs could never climb"
400,6,530,Thy far - off ears; when noiseful Neptune toss’d
400,6,531,Upon his wat’ry bristles my emboss’d
400,6,532,"And rock - torn body. Hear yet now, and deign"
400,6,533,I may of the Phæacian state obtain
400,6,534,"Pity, and grace.” Thus pray’d he, and she heard,"
400,6,535,"By no means yet, expos’d to sight, appear’d,"
400,6,536,"For fear t’ offend her uncle, the supreme"
400,6,537,"Of all the Sea - Gods, whose wrath still extreme"
400,6,538,"Stood to Ulysses; and would never cease,"
400,6,539,Till with his country shore he crown’d his peace.

400,6,552,"[4] The piety and wisdom of the Poet was such, that (agreeing with the"

400,7,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,7,2,Nausicaa arrives at town;
400,7,3,And then Ulysses. He makes known
400,7,4,His suit to Arete: who view
400,7,5,"Takes of his vesture, which she knew,"
400,7,6,And asks him from whose hands it came.
400,7,7,"He tells, with all the hapless frame"
400,7,8,Of his affairs in all the while
400,7,9,Since he forsook Calypso’s isle.
400,7,10,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,7,11,_Ητα._
400,7,12,"The honour’d minds,"
400,7,13,"And welcome things,"
400,7,14,Ulysses finds
400,7,15,In Scheria’s kings.
400,7,16,Thus pray’d the wise and God - observing man.
400,7,17,"The Maid, by free force of her palfreys, wan"
400,7,18,"Access to town, and the renownéd court"
400,7,19,"Reach’d of her father; where, within the port,"
400,7,20,"She stay’d her coach, and round about her came"
400,7,21,"Her brothers, made as of immortal frame,"
400,7,22,"Who yet disdain’d not, for her love, mean deeds,"
400,7,23,"But took from coach her mules, brought in her weeds.[1]"
400,7,24,And she ascends her chamber; where purvey’d
400,7,25,"A quick fire was by her old chamber - maid,"
400,7,26,"Eurymedusa, th’ Aperæan born,"
400,7,27,And brought by sea from Apera t’ adorn
400,7,28,"The court of great Alcinous, because"
400,7,29,"He gave to all the blest Phæacians laws,"
400,7,30,"And, like a heav’n - born pow’r in speech, acquir’d"
400,7,31,"The people’s ears. To one then so admir’d,"
400,7,32,Eurymedusa was esteem’d no worse
400,7,33,"Than worth the gift; yet now, grown old, was nurse"
400,7,34,"To ivory - arm’d Nausicaa, gave heat"
400,7,35,"To all her fires, and dress’d her privy meat."
400,7,36,"Then rose Ulysses, and made way to town;"
400,7,37,"Which ere he reach’d, a mighty mist was thrown"
400,7,38,"By Pallas round about him, in her care,"
400,7,39,"Lest, in the sway of envies popular,"
400,7,40,"Some proud Phæacian might foul language pass,"
400,7,41,"Justle him up, and ask him what he was."
400,7,42,"Ent’ring the lovely town yet, through the cloud"
400,7,43,"Pallas appear’d, and like a young wench show’d"
400,7,44,"Bearing a pitcher, stood before him so"
400,7,45,As if objected purposely to know
400,7,46,What there he needed; whom he question’d thus:
400,7,47,"“Know you not, daughter, where Alcinous,"
400,7,48,"That rules this town, dwells? I, a poor distrest"
400,7,49,"Mere stranger here, know none I may request"
400,7,50,To make this court known to me.” She replied:
400,7,51,"“Strange father, I will see you satisfied"
400,7,52,In that request. My father dwells just by
400,7,53,"The house you seek for; but go silently,"
400,7,54,"Nor ask, nor speak to any other, I"
400,7,55,Shall be enough to show your way. The men
400,7,56,That here inhabit do not entertain
400,7,57,"With ready kindness strangers, of what worth"
400,7,58,"Or state soever, nor have taken forth"
400,7,59,Lessons of civil usage or respect
400,7,60,"To men beyond them. They, upon their pow’rs"
400,7,61,"Of swift ships building, top the wat’ry tow’rs,"
400,7,62,"And Jove hath giv’n them ships, for sail so wrought,"
400,7,63,"They cut a feather, and command a thought.”[2]"
400,7,64,"This said, she usher’d him, and after he"
400,7,65,Trod in the swift steps of the Deity.
400,7,66,The free - sail’d seamen could not get a sight
400,7,67,"Of our Ulysses yet, though he forthright"
400,7,68,"Both by their houses and their persons past,"
400,7,69,Pallas about him such a darkness cast
400,7,70,"By her divine pow’r, and her rev’rend care,"
400,7,71,She would not give the town - born cause to stare.
400,7,72,"He wonder’d, as he past, to see the ports;"
400,7,73,The shipping in them; and for all resorts
400,7,74,The goodly market - steads; and aisles beside
400,7,75,For the heroës; walls so large and wide;
400,7,76,"Rampires so high, and of such strength withall,"
400,7,77,It would with wonder any eye appall.
400,7,78,"At last they reach’d the court, and Pallas said:"
400,7,79,"“Now, honour’d stranger, I will see obey’d"
400,7,80,"Your will, to show our ruler’s house; ’tis here;"
400,7,81,Where you shall find kings celebrating cheer.
400,7,82,"Enter amongst them, nor admit a fear."
400,7,83,"_More bold a man is, he prevails the more,"
400,7,84,Though man nor place lie ever saw before._
400,7,85,"You first shall find the queen in court, whose name"
400,7,86,"Is Arete, of parents born the same"
400,7,87,That was the king her spouse; their pedigree[3]
400,7,88,"I can report. The great Earth - shaker, he"
400,7,89,"Of Peribœa (that her sex out - shone,"
400,7,90,"And youngest daughter was t’ Eurymedon,"
400,7,91,Who of th’ unmeasur’d - minded giants sway’d
400,7,92,"Th’ imperial sceptre, and the pride allay’d"
400,7,93,"Of men so impious with cold death, and died"
400,7,94,Himself soon after) got the magnified
400,7,95,"In mind, Nausithous; whom the kingdom’s state"
400,7,96,First held in supreme rule. Nausithous gat
400,7,97,"Rhexenor, and Alcinous, now king."
400,7,98,"Rhexenor (whose seed did no male fruit spring,"
400,7,99,And whom the silver - bow - grac’d Phœbus slew
400,7,100,Young in the court) his shed blood did renew
400,7,101,"In only Arete, who now is spouse"
400,7,102,"To him that rules the kingdom in this house,"
400,7,103,"And is her uncle king Alcinous,"
400,7,104,Who honours her past equal. She may boast
400,7,105,More honour of him than the honour’d most[4]
400,7,106,"Of any wife in earth can of her lord,"
400,7,107,"How many more soever realms afford,"
400,7,108,That keep house under husbands. Yet no more
400,7,109,"Her husband honours her, than her blest store"
400,7,110,Of gracious children. All the city cast
400,7,111,"Eyes on her as a Goddess, and give taste"
400,7,112,"Of their affections to her in their pray’rs,"
400,7,113,"Still as she decks the street; for, all affairs"
400,7,114,"Wrapt in contention, she dissolves to men."
400,7,115,"Whom she affects, she wants no mind to deign"
400,7,116,Goodness enough. If her heart stand inclin’d
400,7,117,"To your dispatch, hope all you wish to find,"
400,7,118,"Your friends, your longing family, and all"
400,7,119,That can within your most affections fall.”
400,7,120,"This said, away the grey - eyed Goddess flew"
400,7,121,"Along th’ untam’d sea, left the lovely hue"
400,7,122,"Scheria presented, out - flew Marathon,"
400,7,123,And ample - streeted Athens lighted on;
400,7,124,"Where to the house, that casts so thick a shade,[5]"
400,7,125,Of Erechtheüs she ingression made.
400,7,126,Ulysses to the lofty - builded court
400,7,127,Of king Alcinous made bold resort;
400,7,128,"Yet in his heart cast many a thought, before"
400,7,129,The brazen pavement of the rich court bore
400,7,130,His enter’d person. Like heav’n’s two main lights
400,7,131,The rooms illustrated both days and nights.
400,7,132,"On ev’ry side stood firm a wall of brass,"
400,7,133,"Ev’n from the threshold to the inmost pass,"
400,7,134,Which bore a roof up that all - sapphire was.
400,7,135,The brazen thresholds both sides did enfold
400,7,136,"Silver pilasters, hung with gates of gold;"
400,7,137,Whose portal was of silver; over which
400,7,138,A golden cornice did the front enrich.
400,7,139,"On each side, dogs, of gold and silver fram’d,"
400,7,140,The house’s guard stood: which the Deity lam’d
400,7,141,"With knowing inwards had inspir’d, and made"
400,7,142,That death nor age should their estates invade.
400,7,143,"Along the wall stood ev’ry way a throne,"
400,7,144,"From th’ entry to the lobby, ev’ry one"
400,7,145,Cast over with a rich - wrought cloth of state.
400,7,146,Beneath which the Phæacian princes sate
400,7,147,"At wine and food, and feasted all the year."
400,7,148,"Youths forg’d of gold, at ev’ry table there,"
400,7,149,"Stood holding flaming torches, that, in night,"
400,7,150,Gave through the house each honour’d guest his light
400,7,151,"And, to encounter feast with housewif’ry,"
400,7,152,In one room fifty women did apply
400,7,153,Their sev’ral tasks. Some apple - colour’d corn
400,7,154,"Ground in fair querns, and some did spindles turn,"
400,7,155,"Some work in looms; no hand least rest receives,"
400,7,156,But all had motion apt as aspen leaves.
400,7,157,"And from the weeds they wove, so fast they laid,"
400,7,158,"And so thick thrust together thread by thread,"
400,7,159,"That th’ oil, of which the wool had drunk his fill,"
400,7,160,Did with his moisture in light dews distill.
400,7,161,As much as the Phæacian men excell’d
400,7,162,All other countrymen in art to build
400,7,163,A swift - sail’d ship; so much the women there
400,7,164,"For work of webs, past other women were."
400,7,165,"Past mean, by Pallas’ means, they understood"
400,7,166,The grace of good works; and had wits as good.
400,7,167,"Without the hall, and close upon the gate,"
400,7,168,"A goodly orchard - ground was situate,"
400,7,169,Of near ten acres; about which was led
400,7,170,A lofty quickset. In it flourished
400,7,171,"High and broad fruit trees, that pomegranates bore,"
400,7,172,"Sweet figs, pears, olives; and a number more"
400,7,173,"Most useful plants did there produce their store,"
400,7,174,"Whose fruits the hardest winter could not kill,"
400,7,175,Nor hottest summer wither. There was still
400,7,176,Fruit in his proper season all the year.
400,7,177,Sweet Zephyr breath’d upon them blasts that were
400,7,178,Of varied tempers. These he made to bear
400,7,179,"Ripe fruits, these blossoms. Pear grew after pear,"
400,7,180,"Apple succeeded apple, grape the grape,"
400,7,181,Fig after fig came; time made never rape
400,7,182,Of any dainty there. A spritely vine
400,7,183,"Spread here his root, whose fruit a hot sunshine"
400,7,184,Made ripe betimes; here grew another green.
400,7,185,"Here some were gath’ring, here some pressing, seen."
400,7,186,A large - allotted sev’ral each fruit had;
400,7,187,And all th’ adorn’d grounds their appearance made
400,7,188,"In flow’r and fruit, at which the king did aim"
400,7,189,To the precisest order he could claim.
400,7,190,"Two fountains grac’d the garden; of which, one"
400,7,191,Pour’d out a winding stream that over - run
400,7,192,"The grounds for their use chiefly, th’ other went"
400,7,193,"Close by the lofty palace gate, and lent"
400,7,194,The city his sweet benefit. And thus
400,7,195,The Gods the court deck’d of Alcinous.
400,7,196,"Patient Ulysses stood a while at gaze,"
400,7,197,"But, having all observ’d, made instant pace"
400,7,198,"Into the court; where all the peers he found,"
400,7,199,"And captains of Phæacia, with cups - crown’d"
400,7,200,"Off’ring to sharp - eyed Hermes, to whom last"
400,7,201,"They us’d to sacrifice, when sleep had cast"
400,7,202,His inclination through their thoughts. But these
400,7,203,"Ulysses pass’d, and forth went; nor their eyes"
400,7,204,"Took note of him, for Pallas stopp’d the light"
400,7,205,"With mists about him, that, unstay’d, he might"
400,7,206,"First to Alcinous, and Arete,"
400,7,207,"Present his person; and, of both them, she,"
400,7,208,"By Pallas’ counsel, was to have the grace"
400,7,209,Of foremost greeting. Therefore his embrace
400,7,210,He cast about her knee. And then off flew
400,7,211,The heav’nly air that hid him. When his view
400,7,212,With silence and with admiration strook
400,7,213,The court quite through; but thus he silence broke:
400,7,214,"“Divine Rhexenor’s offspring, Arete,"
400,7,215,"To thy most honour’d husband, and to thee,"
400,7,216,A man whom many labours have distrest
400,7,217,"Is come for comfort, and to ev’ry guest."
400,7,218,"To all whom heav’n vouchsafe delightsome lives,"
400,7,219,And after to your issue that survives
400,7,220,"A good resignment of the goods ye leave,"
400,7,221,With all the honour that yourselves receive
400,7,222,Amongst your people. Only this of me
400,7,223,Is the ambition; that I may but see
400,7,224,"(By your vouchsaf’d means, and betimes vouchsaf’d)"
400,7,225,My country - earth; since I have long been left
400,7,226,"To labours, and to errors, barr’d from end,"
400,7,227,"And far from benefit of any friend,”"
400,7,228,"He said no more, but left them dumb with that,"
400,7,229,"Went to the hearth, and in the ashes sat,"
400,7,230,"Aside the fire. At last their silence brake,"
400,7,231,"And Echinëus, th’ old heroë, spake;"
400,7,232,"A man that all Phæacians pass’d in years,"
400,7,233,"And in persuasive eloquence all the peers,"
400,7,234,"Knew much, and us’d it well; and thus spake he:"
400,7,235,"“Alcinous! It shews not decently,"
400,7,236,"Nor doth your honour what you see admit,"
400,7,237,"That this your guest should thus abjectly sit,"
400,7,238,"His chair the earth, the hearth his cushion,"
400,7,239,"Ashes as if appos’d for food. A throne,"
400,7,240,"Adorn’d with due rites, stands you more in hand"
400,7,241,"To see his person plac’d in, and command"
400,7,242,"That instantly your heralds fill - in wine,"
400,7,243,That to the God that doth in lightnings shine
400,7,244,"We may do sacrifice; for he is there,"
400,7,245,Where these his rev’rend suppliants appear.
400,7,246,"Let what you have within be brought abroad,"
400,7,247,To sup the stranger. All these would have show’d
400,7,248,"This fit respect to him, but that they stay"
400,7,249,"For your precedence, that should grace the way.”"
400,7,250,When this had added to the well - inclin’d
400,7,251,"And sacred order of Alcinous’ mind,"
400,7,252,"Then of the great - in - wit the hand he seis’d,"
400,7,253,"And from the ashes his fair person rais’d,"
400,7,254,"Advanc’d him to a well - adornéd throne,"
400,7,255,"And from his seat rais’d his most lovéd son,"
400,7,256,"Laodamas, that next himself was set,"
400,7,257,To give him place. The handmaid then did get
400,7,258,"An ewer of gold, with water fill’d, which plac’d"
400,7,259,"Upon a caldron, all with silver grac’d,"
400,7,260,She pour’d out on their hands. And then was spread
400,7,261,"A table, which the butler set with bread,"
400,7,262,"As others serv’d with other food the board,"
400,7,263,In all the choice the present could afford.
400,7,264,Ulysses meat and wine took; and then thus
400,7,265,The king the herald call’d: “Pontonous!
400,7,266,"Serve wine through all the house, that all may pay"
400,7,267,"Rites to the Lightner, who is still in way"
400,7,268,"With humble suppliants, and them pursues"
400,7,269,With all benign and hospitable dues.”
400,7,270,"Pontonous gave act to all he will’d,"
400,7,271,"And honey - sweetness - giving - minds wine fill’d,[6]"
400,7,272,Disposing it in cups for all to drink.
400,7,273,All having drunk what either’s heart could think
400,7,274,"Fit for due sacrifice, Alcinous said:"
400,7,275,"“Hear me, ye dukes that the Phæacians lead,"
400,7,276,"And you our counsellors, that I may now"
400,7,277,"Discharge the charge my mind suggests to you,"
400,7,278,"For this our guest: Feast past, and this night’s sleep,"
400,7,279,"Next morn, our senate summon’d, we will keep"
400,7,280,"Justs, sacred to the Gods, and this our guest"
400,7,281,Receive in solemn court with fitting feast;
400,7,282,"Then think of his return, that, under hand"
400,7,283,"Of our deduction, his natural land"
400,7,284,"(Without more toil or care, and with delight,"
400,7,285,"And that soon giv’n him, how far - hence dissite"
400,7,286,Soever it can be) he may ascend;
400,7,287,"And in the mean time without wrong attend,"
400,7,288,"Or other want, fit means to that ascent.[7]"
400,7,289,"What, after, austere Fates shall make th’ event"
400,7,290,"Of his life’s thread, now spinning, and began"
400,7,291,"When his pain’d mother freed his root of man,"
400,7,292,He must endure in all kinds. If some God
400,7,293,"Perhaps abides with us in his abode,"
400,7,294,"And other things will think upon than we,"
400,7,295,"The Gods’ wills stand, who ever yet were free"
400,7,296,"Of their appearance to us, when to them"
400,7,297,"We offer’d hecatombs of fit esteem,"
400,7,298,"And would at feast sit with us, ev’n where we"
400,7,299,Order’d our session. They would likewise be
400,7,300,"Encount’rers of us, when in way alone"
400,7,301,About his fit affairs went any one.
400,7,302,Nor let them cloak themselves in any care
400,7,303,"To do us comfort, we as near them are,"
400,7,304,"As are the Cyclops, or the impious race[8]"
400,7,305,"Of earthy giants, that would heav’n outface.”"
400,7,306,Ulysses answer’d: “Let some other doubt
400,7,307,"Employ your thoughts than what your words give out,"
400,7,308,Which intimate a kind of doubt that I
400,7,309,Should shadow in this shape a Deity.
400,7,310,"I bear no such least semblance, or in wit,"
400,7,311,"Virtue, or person. What may well befit"
400,7,312,"One of those mortals, whom you chiefly know"
400,7,313,Bears up and down the burthen of the woe
400,7,314,"Appropriate to poor man, give that to me;"
400,7,315,"Of whose moans I sit in the most degree,"
400,7,316,"And might say more, sustaining griefs that all"
400,7,317,The Gods consent to; no one ’twixt their fall
400,7,318,And my unpitied shoulders letting down
400,7,319,"The least diversion. Be the grace then shown,"
400,7,320,To let me taste your free - giv’n food in peace.
400,7,321,_Through greatest grief the belly must have ease;
400,7,322,Worse than an envious belly nothing is._
400,7,323,"It will command his strict necessities,"
400,7,324,"Of men most griev’d in body or in mind,"
400,7,325,"That are in health, and will not give their kind"
400,7,326,"A desp’rate wound. When most with cause I grieve,"
400,7,327,"It bids me still, Eat, man, and drink, and live;"
400,7,328,And this makes all forgot. Whatever ill
400,7,329,"I ever bear, it ever bids me fill."
400,7,330,"But this ease is but forc’d, and will not last,"
400,7,331,Till what the mind likes be as well embrac’d;
400,7,332,And therefore let me wish you would partake
400,7,333,In your late purpose; when the morn shall make
400,7,334,"Her next appearance, deign me but the grace,"
400,7,335,"Unhappy man, that I may once embrace"
400,7,336,My country - earth. Though I be still thrust at
400,7,337,"By ancient ills, yet make me but see that."
400,7,338,"And then let life go, when withal I see"
400,7,339,"My high - roof’d large house, lands, and family.”"
400,7,340,"This all approv’d; and each will’d ev’ry one,"
400,7,341,"Since he hath said so fairly, set him gone."
400,7,342,"Feast past and sacrifice, to sleep all vow"
400,7,343,Their eyes at either’s house. Ulysses now
400,7,344,"Was left here with Alcinous, and his Queen,"
400,7,345,The all - lov’d Arete. The handmaids then
400,7,346,The vessel of the banquet took away.
400,7,347,When Arete set eye on his array;
400,7,348,"Knew both his out and under weed, which she"
400,7,349,Made with her maids; and mus’d by what means he
400,7,350,Obtain’d their wearing; which she made request
400,7,351,"To know, and wings gave to these speeches: “Guest!"
400,7,352,"First let me ask, what, and from whence you are?"
400,7,353,"And then, who grac’d you with the weeds you wear?"
400,7,354,"Said you not lately, you had err’d at seas,"
400,7,355,And thence arriv’d here?” Laertiades
400,7,356,"To this thus answer’d: “’Tis a pain, O Queen,"
400,7,357,"Still to be op’ning wounds wrought deep, and green,"
400,7,358,Of which the Gods have open’d store in me;
400,7,359,"Yet your will must be serv’d. Far hence, at sea,"
400,7,360,"There lies an isle, that bears Ogygia’s name,"
400,7,361,"Where Atlas’ daughter, the ingenious dame,"
400,7,362,"Fair - hair’d Calypso lives; a Goddess grave,"
400,7,363,And with whom men nor Gods society have;
400,7,364,"Yet I, past man unhappy, liv’d alone,"
400,7,365,"By Heav’n’s wrath forc’d, her house - companion."
400,7,366,For Jove had with a fervent lightning cleft
400,7,367,"My ship in twain, and far at black sea left"
400,7,368,Me and my soldiers; all whose lives I lost.
400,7,369,"I in mine arms the keel took, and was tost"
400,7,370,Nine days together up from wave to wave.
400,7,371,"The tenth grim night, the angry Deities drave"
400,7,372,"Me and my wrack on th’ isle, in which doth dwell"
400,7,373,Dreadful Calypso; who exactly well
400,7,374,"Receiv’d and nourish’d me, and promise made"
400,7,375,"To make me deathless, nor should age invade"
400,7,376,My pow’rs with his deserts through all my days.
400,7,377,"All mov’d not me, and therefore, on her stays,"
400,7,378,Sev’n years she made me lie; and there spent I
400,7,379,"The long time, steeping in the misery"
400,7,380,"Of ceaseless tears the garments I did wear,"
400,7,381,From her fair hand. The eighth revolvéd year
400,7,382,"(Or by her chang’d mind, or by charge of Jove)"
400,7,383,"She gave provok’d way to my wish’d remove,"
400,7,384,"And in a many - jointed ship, with wine"
400,7,385,"Dainty in savour, bread, and weeds divine,"
400,7,386,"Sign’d, with a harmless and sweet wind, my pass."
400,7,387,"Then sev’nteen days at sea I homeward was,"
400,7,388,And by the eighteenth the dark hills appear’d
400,7,389,"That your earth thrusts up. Much my heart was cheer’d,"
400,7,390,"Unhappy man, for that was but a beam,"
400,7,391,To show I yet had agonies extreme
400,7,392,"To put in suff’rance, which th’ Earth - shaker sent,"
400,7,393,"Crossing my way with tempests violent,"
400,7,394,"Unmeasur’d seas up - lifting, nor would give"
400,7,395,The billows leave to let my vessel live
400,7,396,"The least time quiet, that ev’n sigh’d to bear"
400,7,397,"Their bitter outrage, which, at last, did tear"
400,7,398,"Her sides in pieces, set on by the winds."
400,7,399,"I yet through - swum the waves that your shore binds,"
400,7,400,Till wind and water threw me up to it;
400,7,401,"When, coming forth, a ruthless billow smit"
400,7,402,"Against huge rocks, and an accessless shore,"
400,7,403,"My mangl’d body. Back again I bore,"
400,7,404,"And swum till I was fall’n upon a flood,"
400,7,405,"Whose shores, methought, on good advantage stood"
400,7,406,"For my receipt, rock - free, and fenc’d from wind;"
400,7,407,"And this I put for, gath’ring up my mind."
400,7,408,"Then the divine night came, and treading earth,"
400,7,409,"Close by the flood that had from Jove her birth,"
400,7,410,Within a thicket I repos’d; when round
400,7,411,"I ruffled up fall’n leaves in heap; and found,"
400,7,412,"Let fall from heav’n, a sleep interminate."
400,7,413,"And here my heart, long time excruciate,"
400,7,414,"Amongst the leaves I rested all that night,"
400,7,415,Ev’n till the morning and meridian light.
400,7,416,"The sun declining then, delightsome sleep"
400,7,417,"No longer laid my temples in his steep,"
400,7,418,"But forth I went, and on the shore might see"
400,7,419,Your daughter’s maids play. Like a Deity
400,7,420,"She shin’d above them; and I pray’d to her,"
400,7,421,And she in disposition did prefer
400,7,422,"Noblesse, and wisdom, no more low than might"
400,7,423,Become the goodness of a Goddess’ height.
400,7,424,"Nor would you therefore hope, suppos’d distrest"
400,7,425,"As I was then, and old, to find the least"
400,7,426,"Of any grace from her, being younger far."
400,7,427,_With young folks Wisdom makes her commerce rare._
400,7,428,Yet she in all abundance did bestow
400,7,429,"Both wine, that makes the blood in humans grow,[9]"
400,7,430,"And food, and bath’d me in the flood, and gave"
400,7,431,The weeds to me which now ye see me have.
400,7,432,"This through my griefs I tell you, and ’tis true.”"
400,7,433,Alcinous answer’d: “Guest! my daughter knew
400,7,434,Least of what most you give her; nor became
400,7,435,"The course she took, to let with ev’ry dame"
400,7,436,Your person lackey; nor hath with them brought
400,7,437,Yourself home too; which first you had besought.”
400,7,438,"“O blame her not,” said he, “heroical lord,"
400,7,439,Nor let me hear against her worth a word.
400,7,440,"She faultless is, and wish’d I would have gone"
400,7,441,"With all her women home, but I alone"
400,7,442,"Would venture my receipt here, having fear"
400,7,443,And rev’rend awe of accidents that were
400,7,444,"Of likely issue; both your wrath to move,"
400,7,445,And to inflame the common people’s love
400,7,446,"Of speaking ill, to which they soon give place."
400,7,447,_We men are all a most suspicious race.”_
400,7,448,"“My guest,” said he, “I use not to be stirr’d"
400,7,449,To wrath too rashly; and where are preferr’d
400,7,450,"To men’s conceits things that may both ways fail,"
400,7,451,The noblest ever should the most prevail.
400,7,452,"Would Jove our Father, Pallas, and the Sun,"
400,7,453,"That, were you still as now, and could but run"
400,7,454,"One fate with me, you would my daughter wed,"
400,7,455,"And be my son - in - law, still vow’d to lead"
400,7,456,"Your rest of life here! I a house would give,"
400,7,457,"And household goods, so freely you would live,"
400,7,458,Confin’d with us. But ’gainst your will shall none
400,7,459,"Contain you here, since that were violence done"
400,7,460,"To Jove our Father. For your passage home,"
400,7,461,That you may well know we can overcome
400,7,462,"So great a voyage, thus it shall succeed:"
400,7,463,"To - morrow shall our men take all their heed,"
400,7,464,"While you securely sleep, to see the seas"
400,7,465,"In calmest temper, and, if that will please,"
400,7,466,"Show you your country and your house ere night,"
400,7,467,Though far beyond Eubœa be that sight.
400,7,468,"And this Eubœa, as our subjects say"
400,7,469,"That have been there and seen, is far away,"
400,7,470,Farthest from us of all the parts they know;
400,7,471,And made the trial when they help’d to row
400,7,472,"The gold - lock’d Rhadamanth, to give him view"
400,7,473,Of earth - born Tityus; whom their speeds did show
400,7,474,"In that far - off Eubœa, the same day"
400,7,475,They set from hence; and home made good their way
400,7,476,"With ease again, and him they did convey."
400,7,477,"Which I report to you, to let you see"
400,7,478,"How swift my ships are, and how matchlessly"
400,7,479,"My young Phæacians with their oars prevail,"
400,7,480,"To beat the sea through, and assist a sail.”"
400,7,481,"This cheer’d Ulysses, who in private pray’d:"
400,7,482,"“I would to Jove our Father, what he said,"
400,7,483,He could perform at all parts; he should then
400,7,484,"Be glorified for ever, and I gain"
400,7,485,My natural country.” This discourse they had;
400,7,486,When fair - arm’d Arete her handmaids bad
400,7,487,"A bed make in the portico, and ply"
400,7,488,"With clothes, the cov’ring tapestry,"
400,7,489,"The blankets purple; well - napp’d waistcoats too,"
400,7,490,"To wear for more warmth. What these had to do,"
400,7,491,"They torches took and did. The bed purvey’d,"
400,7,492,"They mov’d Ulysses for his rest, and said:"
400,7,493,"“Come guest, your bed is fit, now frame to rest.”"
400,7,494,Motion of sleep was gracious to their guest;
400,7,495,"Which now he took profoundly, being laid"
400,7,496,"Within a loop - hole tow’r, where was convey’d"
400,7,497,The sounding portico. The King took rest
400,7,498,In a retir’d part of the house; where drest
400,7,499,"The Queen her self a bed, and trundlebed,"
400,7,500,And by her lord repos’d her rev’rend head.

400,7,517,[8] Eustathius will have this comparison of the Phæacians with the
400,7,518,Giants and Cyclops to proceed out of the inveterate virulency of
400,7,519,Antinous to the Cyclops; who were cause (as is before said) of their
400,7,520,remove from their country; and with great endeavour labours the
400,7,521,approbation of it; but (under his peace) from the purpose: for the
400,7,522,"sense of the Poet is clear, that the Cyclops and Giants being in part"
400,7,523,"the issue of the Gods, and yet afterward their defiers, (as Polyp."
400,7,524,"hereafter dares profess) Antinous (out of bold and manly reason, even"
400,7,525,"to the face of one that might have been a God, for the past manly"
400,7,526,"appearance he made there) would tell him, and the rest in him, that if"
400,7,527,"they graced those Cyclops with their open appearance, that, though"
400,7,528,"descended from them, durst yet deny them, they might much more do them"
400,7,529,the honour of their open presence that adored them.

400,8,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,8,2,The Peers of the Phæacian State
400,8,3,"A Council call, to consolate"
400,8,4,Ulysses with all means for home.
400,8,5,"The Council to a banquet come,"
400,8,6,"Invited by the King. Which done,"
400,8,7,Assays for hurling of the stone
400,8,8,The youths make with the stranger - king.
400,8,9,"Demodocus, at feast, doth sing"
400,8,10,Th’ adult’ry of the God of Arms
400,8,11,With Her that rules in amorous charms;
400,8,12,And after sings the entercourse
400,8,13,Of acts about th’ Epæan horse.
400,8,14,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,8,15,_Θη̑τα._
400,8,16,The council’s frame
400,8,17,At fleet applied.
400,8,18,In strifes of game
400,8,19,Ulysses tried.
400,8,20,"Now when the rosy - finger’d Morn arose,"
400,8,21,The sacred pow’r Alcinous did dispose
400,8,22,"Did likewise rise; and, like him, left his ease"
400,8,23,The city - razer Laertiades.
400,8,24,The Council at the navy was design’d;
400,8,25,"To which Alcinous, with the sacred mind,"
400,8,26,"Came first of all. On polish’d stones they sate,"
400,8,27,"Near to the navy. To increase the state,"
400,8,28,"Minerva took the herald’s form on her,"
400,8,29,"That serv’d Alcinous, studious to prefer"
400,8,30,Ulysses’ suit for home. About the town
400,8,31,"She made quick way, and fill’d with the renown"
400,8,32,"Of that design the ears of ev’ry man,"
400,8,33,Proclaiming thus: “Peers Phæacensian!
400,8,34,"And Men of Council, all haste to the court,"
400,8,35,To hear the stranger that made late resort
400,8,36,"To King Alcinous, long time lost at sea,"
400,8,37,And is in person like a Deity.”
400,8,38,"This all their pow’rs set up, and spirit instill’d,"
400,8,39,And straight the court and seats with men were fill’d.
400,8,40,"The whole state wonder’d at Laertes’ son,"
400,8,41,When they beheld him. Pallas put him on
400,8,42,"A supernatural and heav’nly dress,"
400,8,43,"Enlarg’d him with a height, and goodliness"
400,8,44,"In breast and shoulders, that he might appear"
400,8,45,"Gracious, and grave, and reverend, and bear"
400,8,46,A perfect hand on his performance there
400,8,47,In all the trials they resolv’d t’ impose.
400,8,48,"All met, and gather’d in attention close,"
400,8,49,"Alcinous thus bespake them: “Dukes, and lords,"
400,8,50,Hear me digest my hearty thoughts in words.
400,8,51,"This stranger here, whose travels found my court,"
400,8,52,"I know not, nor can tell if his resort"
400,8,53,From East or West comes; but his suit is this:
400,8,54,That to his country - earth we would dismiss
400,8,55,"His hither - forcéd person, and doth bear"
400,8,56,The mind to pass it under ev’ry peer;
400,8,57,"Whom I prepare, and stir up, making known"
400,8,58,My free desire of his deductión.
400,8,59,Nor shall there ever any other man
400,8,60,That tries the goodness Phæacensian
400,8,61,"In me, and my court’s entertainment, stay,"
400,8,62,"Mourning for passage, under least delay."
400,8,63,"Come then, a ship into the sacred seas,"
400,8,64,"New - built, now launch we; and from out our prease"
400,8,65,"Choose two - and - fifty youths, of all, the best"
400,8,66,"To use an oar. All which see straight imprest,"
400,8,67,And in their oar - bound seats. Let others hie
400,8,68,"Home to our court, commanding instantly"
400,8,69,"The solemn preparation of a feast,"
400,8,70,In which provision may for any guest
400,8,71,Be made at my charge. Charge of these low things
400,8,72,"I give our youth. You, sceptre - bearing kings,"
400,8,73,"Consort me home, and help with grace to use"
400,8,74,This guest of ours; no one man shall refuse.
400,8,75,"Some other of you haste, and call to us"
400,8,76,"The sacred singer, grave Demodocus,"
400,8,77,To whom hath God giv’n song that can excite
400,8,78,The heart of whom he listeth with delight.”
400,8,79,"This said, he led. The sceptre - bearers lent"
400,8,80,Their free attendance; and with all speed went
400,8,81,The herald for the sacred man - in - song.
400,8,82,"Youths two - and - fifty, chosen from the throng,"
400,8,83,"Went, as was will’d, to the untam’d sea’s shore;"
400,8,84,"Where come, they launch’d the ship, the mast it bore"
400,8,85,"Advanc’d, sails hoiséd, ev’ry seat his oar"
400,8,86,Gave with a leather thong. The deep moist then
400,8,87,"They further reach’d. The dry streets flow’d with men,"
400,8,88,"That troop’d up to the king’s capacious court,"
400,8,89,"Whose porticos were chok’d with the resort,"
400,8,90,"Whose walls were hung with men, young, old, thrust there"
400,8,91,In mighty concourse; for whose promis’d cheer
400,8,92,"Alcinous slew twelve sheep, eight white - tooth’d swine,"
400,8,93,"Two crook - haunch’d beeves; which flay’d and dress’d, divine"
400,8,94,"The show was of so many a jocund guest,"
400,8,95,All set together at so set a feast.
400,8,96,To whose accomplish’d state the herald then
400,8,97,The lovely singer led; who past all mean
400,8,98,"The Muse affected, gave him good, and ill,"
400,8,99,"His eyes put out, but put in soul at will."
400,8,100,His place was giv’n him in a chair all grac’d
400,8,101,"With silver studs, and ’gainst a pillar plac’d:"
400,8,102,"Where, as the centre to the state, he rests,"
400,8,103,And round about the circle of the guests.
400,8,104,The herald on a pin above his head
400,8,105,"His soundful harp hung, to whose height he led"
400,8,106,"His hand for taking of it down at will,"
400,8,107,"A board set by with food, and forth did fill"
400,8,108,"A bowl of wine, to drink at his desire."
400,8,109,"The rest then fell to feast, and, when the fire"
400,8,110,"Of appetite was quench’d, the Muse inflam’d"
400,8,111,The sacred singer. Of men highliest fam’d
400,8,112,"He sung the glories, and a poem penn’d,"
400,8,113,That in applause did ample heav’n ascend.
400,8,114,"Whose subject was, the stern Contentión"
400,8,115,"Betwixt Ulysses and great Thetis’ son,"
400,8,116,"As, at a banquet sacred to the Gods,"
400,8,117,In dreadful language they express’d their odds.
400,8,118,When Agamemnon sat rejoic’d in soul
400,8,119,To hear the Greek peers jar in terms so foul;
400,8,120,For augur Phœbus in presage had told
400,8,121,The King of men (desirous to unfold
400,8,122,"The war’s perplex’d end, and being therefore gone"
400,8,123,"In heav’nly Pythia to the porch of stone,)"
400,8,124,That then the end of all griefs should begin
400,8,125,"’Twixt Greece and Troy, when Greece (with strife to win"
400,8,126,"That wish’d conclusion) in her kings should jar,"
400,8,127,"And plead, if force or wit must end the war."
400,8,128,"This brave Contention did the poet sing,"
400,8,129,"Expressing so the spleen of either king,"
400,8,130,That his large purple weed Ulysses held
400,8,131,"Before his face and eyes, since thence distill’d"
400,8,132,"Tears uncontain’d; which he obscur’d, in fear"
400,8,133,To let th’ observing presence note a tear.
400,8,134,"But, when his sacred song the mere divine"
400,8,135,"Had giv’n an end, a goblet crown’d with wine"
400,8,136,"Ulysses, drying his wet eyes, did seize,[1]"
400,8,137,And sacrific’d to those Gods that would please
400,8,138,T’ inspire the poet with a song so fit
400,8,139,"To do him honour, and renown his wit."
400,8,140,"His tears then stay’d. But when again began,"
400,8,141,"By all the kings’ desires, the moving man,"
400,8,142,Again Ulysses could not choose but yield
400,8,143,"To that soft passion, which again, withheld,"
400,8,144,"He kept so cunningly from sight, that none,"
400,8,145,"Except Alcinous himself alone,"
400,8,146,"Discern’d him mov’d so much. But he sat next,"
400,8,147,And heard him deeply sigh; which his pretext
400,8,148,Could not keep hid from him. Yet he conceal’d
400,8,149,"His utt’rance of it, and would have it held"
400,8,150,"From all the rest, brake off the song, and this"
400,8,151,Said to those oar - affecting peers of his:
400,8,152,"“Princes, and peers! We now are satiate"
400,8,153,"With sacred song that fits a feast of state,"
400,8,154,"With wine and food. Now then to field, and try"
400,8,155,"In all kinds our approv’d activity,"
400,8,156,"That this our guest may give his friends to know,"
400,8,157,"In his return, that we as little owe"
400,8,158,"To fights and wrastlings, leaping, speed - of race,"
400,8,159,As these our court - rites; and commend our grace
400,8,160,"In all to all superior.” Forth he led,"
400,8,161,The peers and people troop’d up to their head.
400,8,162,Nor must Demodocus be left within;
400,8,163,"Whose harp the herald hung upon the pin,"
400,8,164,"His hand in his took, and abroad he brought"
400,8,165,"The heav’nly poet, out the same way wrought"
400,8,166,"That did the princes, and what they would see"
400,8,167,"With admiration, with his company"
400,8,168,They wish’d to honour. To the place of game
400,8,169,"These throng’d; and after routs of other came,"
400,8,170,"Of all sort, infinite. Of youths that strove,"
400,8,171,Many and strong rose to their trial’s love.
400,8,172,"Up rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus,"
400,8,173,"Elatreus, Prymneus, and Anchialus,[2]"
400,8,174,"Nauteus, Eretmeus, Thoen, Proreüs,"
400,8,175,"Pontëus, and the strong Amphialus"
400,8,176,Son to Tectonides Polyneüs.
400,8,177,"Up rose to these the great Euryalus,"
400,8,178,In action like the Homicide of War.
400,8,179,"Naubolides, that was for person far"
400,8,180,"Past all the rest, but one he could not pass,"
400,8,181,"Nor any thought improve, Laodamas."
400,8,182,Up Anabesinëus then arose;
400,8,183,"And three sons of the Sceptre - state, and those"
400,8,184,"Were Halius, the fore - prais’d Laodamas,"
400,8,185,And Clytonëus like a God in grace.
400,8,186,"These first the foot - game tried, and from the lists"
400,8,187,Took start together. Up the dust in mists
400,8,188,"They hurl’d about, as in their speed they flew;"
400,8,189,But Clytonëus first of all the crew
400,8,190,A stitch’s length in any fallow field
400,8,191,"Made good his pace; when, where the judges yield"
400,8,192,"The prize and praise, his glorious speed arriv’d."
400,8,193,"Next, for the boist’rous wrastling game they striv’d;"
400,8,194,At which Euryalus the rest outshone.
400,8,195,"At leap Amphialus, At the hollow stone"
400,8,196,"Elatreüs excell’d. At buffets, last,"
400,8,197,"Laodamas, the king’s fair son, surpast."
400,8,198,"When all had striv’d in these assays their fill,"
400,8,199,"Laodamas said: “Come friends, let’s prove what skill"
400,8,200,This stranger hath attain’d to in our sport.
400,8,201,"Methinks, he must be of the active sort,"
400,8,202,"His calves, thighs, hands, and well - knit shoulders show"
400,8,203,That Nature disposition did bestow
400,8,204,To fit with fact their form. Nor wants he prime.
400,8,205,"But sour affliction, made a mate with time,"
400,8,206,"Makes time the more seen. Nor imagine I,"
400,8,207,A worse thing to enforce debility
400,8,208,"Than is the sea, though nature ne’er so strong"
400,8,209,"Knits one together.” “Nor conceive you wrong,”"
400,8,210,"Replied Euryalus, “but prove his blood"
400,8,211,With what you question.” In the midst then stood
400,8,212,"Renown’d Laodamas, and prov’d him thus:"
400,8,213,"“Come, stranger - father, and assay with us"
400,8,214,Your pow’rs in these contentions. If your show
400,8,215,"Be answer’d with your worth, ’tis fit that you"
400,8,216,Should know these conflicts. Nor doth glory stand
400,8,217,"On any worth more, in a man’s command,"
400,8,218,Than to be strenuous both of foot and hand.
400,8,219,"Come then, make proof with us, discharge your mind"
400,8,220,Of discontentments; for not far behind
400,8,221,"Comes your deduction, ship is ready now,[3]"
400,8,222,"And men, and all things.” “Why,” said he, “dost thou"
400,8,223,"Mock me, Laodamas, and these strifes bind"
400,8,224,My pow’rs to answer? I am more inclin’d
400,8,225,"To cares than conflict. Much sustain’d I have,"
400,8,226,"And still am suff’ring. I come here to crave,"
400,8,227,"In your assemblies, means to be dismist,"
400,8,228,And pray both kings and subjects to assist.”
400,8,229,"Euryalus an open brawl began,"
400,8,230,"And said: “I take you, sir, for no such man"
400,8,231,As fits these honour’d strifes. A number more
400,8,232,Strange men there are that I would choose before.
400,8,233,"To one that loves to lie aship - board much,"
400,8,234,Or is the prince of sailors; or to such
400,8,235,"As traffic far and near, and nothing mind"
400,8,236,"But freight, and passage, and a foreright wind;"
400,8,237,Or to a victualler of a ship; or men
400,8,238,That set up all their pow’rs for rampant gain;
400,8,239,"I can compare, or hold you like to be:"
400,8,240,"But, for a wrastler, or of quality"
400,8,241,"Fit for contentions noble, you abhor"
400,8,242,From worth of any such competitor.”
400,8,243,"Ulysses, frowning, answer’d: “Stranger, far"
400,8,244,Thy words are from the fashions regular
400,8,245,"Of kind, or honour. Thou art in thy guise"
400,8,246,Like to a man that authors injuries.[4]
400,8,247,"I see, the Gods to all men give not all"
400,8,248,"Manly addiction, wisdom, words that fall,"
400,8,249,"Like dice, upon the square still. Some man takes"
400,8,250,"Ill form from parents, but God often makes"
400,8,251,That fault of form up with observ’d repair
400,8,252,"Of pleasing speech, that makes him held for fair,"
400,8,253,"That makes him speak securely, makes him shine"
400,8,254,In an assembly with a grace divine.
400,8,255,Men take delight to see how ev’nly lie
400,8,256,His words asteep in honey modesty.
400,8,257,"Another, then, hath fashion like a God,"
400,8,258,But in his language he is foul and broad.
400,8,259,"And such art thou. A person fair is giv’n,"
400,8,260,But nothing else is in thee sent from heav’n;
400,8,261,"For in thee lurks a base and earthy soul,"
400,8,262,"And t’ hast compell’d me, with a speech most foul,"
400,8,263,To be thus bitter. I am not unseen
400,8,264,"In these fair strifes, as thy words overween,"
400,8,265,But in the first rank of the best I stand;
400,8,266,"At least I did, when youth and strength of hand"
400,8,267,"Made me thus confident, but now am worn"
400,8,268,"With woes and labours, as a human born"
400,8,269,To bear all anguish. Suffer’d much I have.
400,8,270,"The war of men, and the inhuman wave,"
400,8,271,Have I driv’n through at all parts. But with all
400,8,272,"My waste in suff’rance, what yet may fall"
400,8,273,"In my performance, at these strifes I’ll try."
400,8,274,"Thy speech hath mov’d, and made my wrath run high.”"
400,8,275,"This said, with robe and all, he grasp’d a stone,"
400,8,276,A little graver than was ever thrown
400,8,277,"By these Phæacians in their wrastling rout,"
400,8,278,"More firm, more massy; which, turn’d round about,"
400,8,279,He hurried from him with a hand so strong
400,8,280,"It sung, and flew, and over all the throng,"
400,8,281,"That at the others’ marks stood, quite it went;"
400,8,282,"Yet down fell all beneath it, fearing spent"
400,8,283,"The force that drave it flying from his hand,"
400,8,284,"As it a dart were, or a walking wand;"
400,8,285,And far past all the marks of all the rest
400,8,286,His wing stole way; when Pallas straight imprest
400,8,287,"A mark at fall of it, resembling then"
400,8,288,"One of the navy - giv’n Phæacian men,"
400,8,289,"And thus advanc’d Ulysses: “One, though blind,"
400,8,290,"O stranger, groping, may thy stone’s fall find,"
400,8,291,"For not amidst the rout of marks it fell,"
400,8,292,"But far before all. Of thy worth think well,"
400,8,293,And stand in all strifes. No Phæacian here
400,8,294,This bound can either better or come near.”
400,8,295,Ulysses joy’d to hear that one man yet
400,8,296,"Us’d him benignly, and would truth abet"
400,8,297,In those contentions; and then thus smooth
400,8,298,"He took his speech down: “Reach me that now, youth,"
400,8,299,"You shall, and straight I think, have one such more,"
400,8,300,"And one beyond it too. And now, whose core"
400,8,301,"Stands sound and great within him, since ye have"
400,8,302,"Thus put my spleen up, come again and brave"
400,8,303,"The guest ye tempted, with such gross disgrace,"
400,8,304,"At wrastling, buffets, whirlbat, speed o’ race;"
400,8,305,"At all, or either, I except at none,"
400,8,306,"But urge the whole state of you; only one,"
400,8,307,"I will not challenge in my forced boast,"
400,8,308,"And that’s Laodamas, for he’s mine host.[5]"
400,8,309,"And who will fight, or wrangle, with his friend?"
400,8,310,"Unwise he is, and base, that will contend"
400,8,311,With him that feeds him in a foreign place;
400,8,312,And takes all edge off from his own sought grace.
400,8,313,"None else except I here, nor none despise,"
400,8,314,"But wish to know, and prove his faculties,"
400,8,315,That dares appear now. No strife ye can name
400,8,316,Am I unskill’d in; reckon any game
400,8,317,"Of all that are, as many as there are"
400,8,318,In use with men. For archery I dare
400,8,319,Affirm myself not mean. Of all a troop
400,8,320,"I’ll make the first foe with mine arrow stoop,"
400,8,321,Though with me ne’er so many fellows bend
400,8,322,"Their bows at mark’d men, and affect their end."
400,8,323,Only was Philoctetes with his bow
400,8,324,"Still my superior, when we Greeks would show"
400,8,325,Our archery against our foes of Troy.
400,8,326,"But all, that now by bread frail life enjoy,"
400,8,327,"I far hold my inferiors. Men of old,"
400,8,328,"None now alive shall witness me so bold,"
400,8,329,"To vaunt equality with, such men as these,"
400,8,330,"Œchalián Eurytus, Hercules,"
400,8,331,Who with their bows durst with the Gods contend;
400,8,332,"And therefore caught Eurytus soon his end,"
400,8,333,"Nor died at home, in age, a rev’rend man."
400,8,334,But by the great incenséd Delphian
400,8,335,"Was shot to death, for daring competence"
400,8,336,With him in all an archer’s excellence.
400,8,337,A spear I’ll hurl as far as any man
400,8,338,Shall shoot a shaft. How at a race I can
400,8,339,"Bestir my feet, I only yield to fear,"
400,8,340,And doubt to meet with my superior here.
400,8,341,So many seas so too much have misus’d
400,8,342,"My limbs for race, and therefore have diffus’d"
400,8,343,A dissolution through my lovéd knees.”
400,8,344,"This said, he still’d all talking properties."
400,8,345,"Alcinous only answer’d: “O my guest,"
400,8,346,In good part take we what you have been prest
400,8,347,With speech to answer. You would make appear
400,8,348,"Your virtues therefore, that will still shine where"
400,8,349,Your only look is. Yet must this man give
400,8,350,"Your worth ill language; when, he does not live"
400,8,351,"In sort of mortals (whencesoe’er he springs,"
400,8,352,That judgment hath to speak becoming things)
400,8,353,That will deprave your virtues. Note then now
400,8,354,"My speech, and what my love presents to you,"
400,8,355,"That you may tell heroës, when you come"
400,8,356,"To banquet with your wife and birth at home,"
400,8,357,(Mindful of our worth) what deservings Jove
400,8,358,"Hath put on our parts likewise, in remove"
400,8,359,"From sire to son, as an inherent grace"
400,8,360,"Kind, and perpetual. We must needs give place"
400,8,361,"To other countrymen, and freely yield"
400,8,362,"We are not blameless in our fights of field,"
400,8,363,"Buffets, nor wrastlings; but in speed of feet,"
400,8,364,"And all the equipage that fits a fleet,"
400,8,365,We boast us best; for table ever spread
400,8,366,"With neighbour feasts, for garments varied,"
400,8,367,"For poesy, music, dancing, baths, and beds."
400,8,368,"And now, Phæacians, you that bear your heads"
400,8,369,"And feet with best grace in enamouring dance,"
400,8,370,"Enflame our guest here, that he may advance"
400,8,371,"Our worth past all the world’s to his home - friends,"
400,8,372,As well for the unmatch’d grace that commends.
400,8,373,"Your skill in footing of a dance, as theirs"
400,8,374,"That fly a race best. And so, all affairs,"
400,8,375,"At which we boast us best, he best may try,"
400,8,376,"As sea - race, land - race, dance, and poesy."
400,8,377,"Some one with instant speed to court retire,"
400,8,378,And fetch Demodocus’s soundful lyre.”
400,8,379,This said the God - grac’d king; and quick resort
400,8,380,Pontonous made for that fair harp to court.
400,8,381,"Nine of the lot - choos’d public rulers rose,"
400,8,382,"That all in those contentions did dispose,"
400,8,383,"Commanding a most smooth ground, and a wide,"
400,8,384,And all the people in fair game aside.
400,8,385,"Then with the rich harp came Pontonous,"
400,8,386,And in the midst took place Demodocus.
400,8,387,"About him then stood forth the choice young men,[6]"
400,8,388,"That on man’s first youth made fresh entry then,"
400,8,389,"Had art to make their natural motion sweet,"
400,8,390,"And shook a most divine dance from their feet,"
400,8,391,"That twinkled star - like, mov’d as swift, and fine,"
400,8,392,"And beat the air so thin, they made it shine."
400,8,393,"Ulysses wonder’d at it, but amaz’d"
400,8,394,He stood in mind to hear the dance so phras’d.
400,8,395,"For, as they danc’d, Demodocus did sing,"
400,8,396,The bright - crown’d Venus’ love with Battle’s King;
400,8,397,As first they closely mix’d in th’ house of fire.
400,8,398,"What worlds of gifts won her to his desire,"
400,8,399,Who then the night - and - day - bed did defile
400,8,400,Of good king Vulcan. But in little while
400,8,401,"The Sun their mixture saw, and came and told."
400,8,402,The bitter news did by his ears take hold
400,8,403,"Of Vulcan’s heart. Then to his forge he went,"
400,8,404,And in his shrewd mind deep stuff did invent.
400,8,405,"His mighty anvil in the stock he put,"
400,8,406,"And forg’d a net that none could loose or cut,"
400,8,407,That when it had them it might hold them fast.
400,8,408,"Which having finish’d, he made utmost haste"
400,8,409,"Up to the dear room where his wife he woo’d,"
400,8,410,"And, madly wrath with Mars, he all bestrow’d"
400,8,411,"The bed, and bed - posts, all the beam above"
400,8,412,That cross’d the chamber; and a circle strove
400,8,413,Of his device to wrap in all the room.
400,8,414,"And ’twas as pure, as of a spider’s loom"
400,8,415,The woof before ’tis wov’n. No man nor God
400,8,416,"Could set his eye on it, a sleight so odd"
400,8,417,His art show’d in it. All his craft bespent
400,8,418,"About the bed, he feign’d as if he went"
400,8,419,"To well - built Lemnos, his most lovéd town"
400,8,420,Of all towns earthly; nor left this unknown
400,8,421,"To golden - bridle - using Mars, who kept"
400,8,422,"No blind watch over him, but, seeing stept"
400,8,423,"His rival so aside, he hasted home"
400,8,424,"With fair - wreath’d Venus’ love stung, who was come"
400,8,425,New from the court of her most mighty Sire.
400,8,426,"Mars enter’d, wrung her hand, and the retire"
400,8,427,"Her husband made to Lemnos told, and said;"
400,8,428,"“Now, love, is Vulcan gone, let us to bed,"
400,8,429,He’s for the barbarous Sintians.” Well appay’d
400,8,430,Was Venus with it; and afresh assay’d
400,8,431,Their old encounter. Down they went; and straight
400,8,432,About them cling’d the artificial sleight
400,8,433,"Of most wise Vulcan; and were so ensnar’d,"
400,8,434,That neither they could stir their course prepar’d
400,8,435,"In any limb about them, nor arise."
400,8,436,"And then they knew, they would no more disguise"
400,8,437,"Their close conveyance, but lay, forc’d, stone - still."
400,8,438,"Back rush’d the both - foot - cook’d, but straight in skill,"
400,8,439,"From his near scout - hole turn’d, nor ever went"
400,8,440,"To any Lemnos, but the sure event"
400,8,441,"Left Phœbus to discover, who told all."
400,8,442,"Then home hopp’d Vulcan, full of grief and gall,"
400,8,443,"Stood in the portal, and cried out so high,"
400,8,444,"That all the Gods heard; “Father of the sky,"
400,8,445,"And ev’ry other deathless God,” said he,"
400,8,446,"“Come all, and a ridiculous object see,"
400,8,447,"And yet not sufferable neither. Come,"
400,8,448,"And witness how, when still I step from home,"
400,8,449,"Lame that I am, Jove’s daughter doth profess"
400,8,450,"To do me all the shameful offices,"
400,8,451,"Indignities, despites, that can be thought;"
400,8,452,"And loves this all - things - making - come - to - nought,"
400,8,453,"Since he is fair forsooth, foot - sound, and I"
400,8,454,"Took in my brain a little, legg’d awry."
400,8,455,"And no fault mine, but all my parent’s fault,"
400,8,456,"Who should not get, if mock me, with my halt."
400,8,457,"But see how fast they sleep, while I, in moan,"
400,8,458,Am only made an idle looker on.
400,8,459,"One bed their turn serves, and it must be mine;"
400,8,460,"I think yet, I have made their self - loves shine."
400,8,461,"They shall no more wrong me, and none perceive;"
400,8,462,"Nor will they sleep together, I believe,"
400,8,463,With too hot haste again. Thus both shall lie
400,8,464,"In craft, and force, till the extremity"
400,8,465,Of all the dow’r I gave her sire (to gain
400,8,466,"A doggéd set - fac’d girl, that will not stain"
400,8,467,"Her face with blushing, though she shame her head)"
400,8,468,"He pays me back. She’s fair, but was no maid.”"
400,8,469,"While this long speech was making, all were come"
400,8,470,"To Vulcan’s wholly - brazen - founded home,"
400,8,471,"Earth - shaking Neptune, useful Mercury,"
400,8,472,"And far - shot Phœbus. No She - Deity,"
400,8,473,"For shame, would show there. All the give - good Gods"
400,8,474,"Stood in the portal, and past periods"
400,8,475,"Gave length to laughters, all rejoic’d to see"
400,8,476,"That which they said, that no impiety"
400,8,477,"Finds good success at th’ end. “And now,” said one,"
400,8,478,"“The slow outgoes the swift. Lame Vulcan, known"
400,8,479,"To be the slowest of the Gods, outgoes"
400,8,480,Mars the most swift. And this is that which grows
400,8,481,"To greatest justice: that adult’ry’s sport,"
400,8,482,"Obtain’d by craft, by craft of other sort"
400,8,483,"(And lame craft too) is plagued, which grieves the more,"
400,8,484,That sound limbs turning lame the lame restore.”[7]
400,8,485,"This speech amongst themselves they entertain’d,"
400,8,486,When Phœbus thus ask’d Hermes: “Thus enchain’d
400,8,487,"Wouldst thou be, Hermes, to be thus disclos’d?"
400,8,488,Though with thee golden Venus were repos’d?”
400,8,489,"He soon gave that an answer: “O,” said he,"
400,8,490,"“Thou king of archers, would ’twere thus with me!"
400,8,491,"Though thrice so much shame; nay, though infinite"
400,8,492,"Were pour’d about me, and that ev’ry light,"
400,8,493,"In great heav’n shining, witness’d all my harms,"
400,8,494,So golden Venus slumber’d in mine arms.”
400,8,495,The Gods again laugh’d; even the Watery State
400,8,496,"Wrung out a laughter, but propitiate"
400,8,497,"Was still for Mars, and pray’d the God of Fire"
400,8,498,"He would dissolve him, off’ring the desire"
400,8,499,"He made to Jove to pay himself, and said,"
400,8,500,All due debts should be by the Gods repaid.
400,8,501,"“Pay me, no words,” said he, “where deeds lend pain,"
400,8,502,Wretched the words are giv’n for wretched men.
400,8,503,"How shall I bind you in th’ Immortals’ sight,"
400,8,504,"If Mars be once loos’d, nor will pay his right?”[8]"
400,8,505,"“Vulcan,” said he, “if Mars should fly, nor see"
400,8,506,"Thy right repaid, it should be paid by me.”"
400,8,507,"“Your word, so giv’n, I must accept,” said he."
400,8,508,"Which said, he loos’d them. Mars then rush’d from sky,"
400,8,509,And stoop’d cold Thrace. The laughing Deity
400,8,510,"For Cyprus was, and took her Paphian state,"
400,8,511,"Where she a grove, ne’er cut, had consecrate,"
400,8,512,"All with Arabian odours fum’d, and hath"
400,8,513,"An altar there, at which the Graces bathe,"
400,8,514,"And with immortal balms besmooth, her skin,"
400,8,515,Fit for the bliss Immortals solace in;
400,8,516,"Deck’d her in to - be - studiéd attire,"
400,8,517,And apt to set beholders’ hearts on fire.
400,8,518,"This sung the sacred muse, whose notes and words"
400,8,519,The dancers’ feet kept as his hands his chords.
400,8,520,"Ulysses much was pleas’d, and all the crew."
400,8,521,This would the king have varied with a new
400,8,522,"And pleasing measure, and performéd by"
400,8,523,"Two, with whom none would strive in dancery;"
400,8,524,"And those his sons were, that must therefore dance"
400,8,525,"Alone, and only to the harp advance,"
400,8,526,Without the words. And this sweet couple was
400,8,527,"Young Halius, and divine Laodamas;"
400,8,528,"Who danc’d a ball - dance. Then the rich - wrought ball,"
400,8,529,"That Polybus had made, of purple all,"
400,8,530,"They took to hand. One threw it to the sky,"
400,8,531,"And then danc’d back; the other, capering high,"
400,8,532,"Would surely catch it ere his foot touch’d ground,"
400,8,533,"And up again advanc’d it, and so found"
400,8,534,The other cause of dance; and then did he
400,8,535,"Dance lofty tricks, till next it came to be"
400,8,536,"His turn to catch, and serve the other still."
400,8,537,"When they had kept it up to either’s will,"
400,8,538,"They then danc’d ground tricks, oft mix’d hand in hand,"
400,8,539,"And did so gracefully their change command,"
400,8,540,"That all the other youth that stood at pause,"
400,8,541,"With deaf’ning shouts, gave them the great applause."
400,8,542,"Then said Ulysses: “O, past all men here"
400,8,543,"Clear, not in pow’r, but in desert as clear,"
400,8,544,"You said your dancers did the world surpass,"
400,8,545,"And they perform it clear, and to amaze.”"
400,8,546,"This won Alcinous’ heart, and equal prize"
400,8,547,"He gave Ulysses, saying: “Matchless wise,"
400,8,548,"Princes and rulers, I perceive our guest,"
400,8,549,And therefore let our hospitable best
400,8,550,In fitting gifts be giv’n him: Twelve chief kings
400,8,551,There are that order all the glorious things
400,8,552,"Of this our kingdom; and, the thirteenth, I"
400,8,553,"Exist, as crown to all. Let instantly"
400,8,554,"Be thirteen garments giv’n him, and of gold"
400,8,555,"Precious, and fine, a talent. While we hold"
400,8,556,"This our assembly, be all fetch’d, and giv’n,"
400,8,557,"That to our feast prepar’d, as to his heav’n,"
400,8,558,"Our guest may enter. And, that nothing be"
400,8,559,"Left unperform’d that fits his dignity,"
400,8,560,Euryalus shall here conciliate
400,8,561,"Himself with words and gifts, since past our rate"
400,8,562,He gave bad language.” This did all commend
400,8,563,And give in charge; and ev’ry king did send
400,8,564,"His herald for his gift. Euryalus,"
400,8,565,"Answ’ring for his part, said: “Alcinous!"
400,8,566,"Our chief of all, since you command, I will"
400,8,567,"To this our guest by all means reconcile,"
400,8,568,"And give him this entirely - metall’d sword,"
400,8,569,"The handle massy silver, and the board,"
400,8,570,"That gives it cover, all of ivory,"
400,8,571,"New, and in all kinds worth his quality.”"
400,8,572,"This put he straight into his hand, and said:"
400,8,573,"“Frolic, O guest and father; if words fled"
400,8,574,"Have been offensive, let swift whirlwinds take"
400,8,575,And ravish them from thought. May all Gods make
400,8,576,"Thy wife’s sight good to thee, in quick retreat"
400,8,577,"To all thy friends, and best - lov’d breeding seat,"
400,8,578,Their long miss quitting with the greater joy;
400,8,579,In whose sweet vanish all thy worst annoy.”
400,8,580,"“And frolic thou to all height, friend,” said he,"
400,8,581,“Which heav’n confirm with wish’d felicity;
400,8,582,Nor ever give again desire to thee
400,8,583,"Of this sword’s use, which with affects so free,"
400,8,584,"In my reclaim, thou hast bestow’d on me.”"
400,8,585,"This said, athwart his shoulders he put on"
400,8,586,The right fair sword; and then did set the sun.
400,8,587,"When all the gifts were brought, which back again"
400,8,588,(With king Alcinous in all the train)
400,8,589,Were by the honour’d heralds borne to court;
400,8,590,"Which his fair sons took, and from the resort"
400,8,591,Laid by their rev’rend mother. Each his throne
400,8,592,Of all the peers (which yet were overshone
400,8,593,In king Alcinous’ command) ascended;
400,8,594,"Whom he to pass as much in gifts contended,"
400,8,595,And to his queen said: “Wife! See brought me here
400,8,596,"The fairest cabinet I have, and there"
400,8,597,"Impose a well - cleans’d in, and utter, weed."
400,8,598,"A caldron heat with water, that with speed"
400,8,599,"Our guest well - bath’d, and all his gifts made sure,"
400,8,600,It may a joyful appetite procure
400,8,601,"To his succeeding feast, and make him hear"
400,8,602,The poet’s hymn with the securer ear.
400,8,603,"To all which I will add my bowl of gold,"
400,8,604,"In all frame curious, to make him hold"
400,8,605,"My memory always dear, and sacrifice"
400,8,606,With it at home to all the Deities.”
400,8,607,Then Arete her maids charg’d to set on
400,8,608,"A well - siz’d caldron quickly. Which was done,"
400,8,609,"Clear water pour’d in, flame made so entire,"
400,8,610,"It gilt the brass, and made the water fire."
400,8,611,"In mean space, from her chamber brought the queen"
400,8,612,"A wealthy cabinet, where, pure and clean,"
400,8,613,"She put the garments, and the gold bestow’d"
400,8,614,"By that free state, and then the other vow’d"
400,8,615,"By her Alcinous, and said: “Now, guest,"
400,8,616,"Make close and fast your gifts, lest, when you rest"
400,8,617,"Aship - board sweetly, in your way you meet"
400,8,618,"Some loss, that less may make your next sleep sweet.”"
400,8,619,"This when Ulysses heard, all sure he made"
400,8,620,Enclos’d and bound safe; for the saving trade
400,8,621,"The rev’rend - for - her - wisdom, Circe, had"
400,8,622,In foreyears taught him. Then the handmaid bad
400,8,623,"His worth to bathing; which rejoic’d his heart,"
400,8,624,"For, since he did with his Calypso part,"
400,8,625,"He had no hot baths; none had favour’d him,"
400,8,626,Nor been so tender of his kingly limb.
400,8,627,"But all the time he spent in her abode,"
400,8,628,He liv’d respected as he were a God.
400,8,629,"Cleans’d then and balm’d, fair shirt and robe put on,"
400,8,630,"Fresh come from bath, and to the feasters gone,"
400,8,631,"Nausicaa, that from the Gods’ hands took"
400,8,632,"The sov’reign beauty of her blessed look,"
400,8,633,"Stood by a well - carv’d column of the room,"
400,8,634,And through her eye her heart was overcome
400,8,635,With admiration of the port imprest
400,8,636,"In his aspéct, and said: “God save you, guest!"
400,8,637,"Be cheerful, as in all the future state"
400,8,638,Your home will show you in your better fate.
400,8,639,"But yet, ev’n then, let this remember’d be,"
400,8,640,"Your life’s price I lent, and you owe it me.”"
400,8,641,The varied - in - all - counsels gave reply:
400,8,642,“Nausicaa! Flow’r of all this empery!
400,8,643,"So Juno’s husband, that the strife for noise"
400,8,644,"Makes in the clouds, bless me with strife of joys,"
400,8,645,"In the desir’d day that my house shall show,"
400,8,646,"As I, as I to a Goddess there shall vow,"
400,8,647,"To thy fair hand that did my being give,"
400,8,648,Which I’ll acknowledge ev’ry hour I live.”
400,8,649,"This said, Alcinous plac’d him by his side."
400,8,650,"Then took they feast, and did in parts divide"
400,8,651,"The sev’ral dishes, fill’d out wine, and then"
400,8,652,"The striv’d - for - for - his - worth of worthy men,[9]"
400,8,653,"And rev’renc’d - of - the - state, Demodocus"
400,8,654,Was brought in by the good Pontonous.
400,8,655,"In midst of all the guests they gave him place,"
400,8,656,"Against a lofty pillar, when this grace"
400,8,657,"The grac’d - with - wisdom did him: From the chine,"
400,8,658,"That stood before him, of a white - tooth’d swine,"
400,8,659,"Being far the daintiest joint, mix’d through with fat,"
400,8,660,"He carv’d to him, and sent it where he sat"
400,8,661,"By his old friend the herald, willing thus:"
400,8,662,"“Herald, reach this to grave Demodocus,"
400,8,663,"Say, I salute him, and his worth embrace."
400,8,664,"Poets deserve, past all the human race,"
400,8,665,"Rev’rend respect and honour, since the queen"
400,8,666,"Of knowledge, and the supreme worth in men,"
400,8,667,"The Muse, informs them, and loves all their race.”"
400,8,668,"This reach’d the herald to him, who the grace"
400,8,669,"Receiv’d encourag’d; which, when feast was spent,"
400,8,670,Ulysses amplified to this ascent:
400,8,671,"“Demodocus! I must prefer you far,"
400,8,672,"Past all your sort, if, or the Muse of war,"
400,8,673,"Jove’s daughter, prompts you, that the Greeks respects,"
400,8,674,"Or if the Sun, that those of Troy affects."
400,8,675,"For I have heard you, since my coming, sing"
400,8,676,The fate of Greece to an admiréd string.
400,8,677,"How much our suff’rance was, how much we wrought,"
400,8,678,How much the actions rose - to when we fought.
400,8,679,"So lively forming, as you had been there,"
400,8,680,Or to some free relater lent your ear.
400,8,681,"Forth then, and sing the wooden horse’s frame,"
400,8,682,"Built by Epëus, by the martial Dame"
400,8,683,"Taught the whole fabric; which, by force of sleight,"
400,8,684,"Ulysses brought into the city’s height,"
400,8,685,When he had stuff’d it with as many men
400,8,686,As levell’d lofty Ilion with the plain.
400,8,687,"With all which if you can as well enchant,"
400,8,688,As with expression quick and elegant
400,8,689,"You sung the rest, I will pronounce you clear"
400,8,690,"Inspir’d by God, past all that ever were.”"
400,8,691,"This said, ev’n stirr’d by God up, he began,"
400,8,692,"And to his song fell, past the forms of man,"
400,8,693,"Beginning where the Greeks aship - board went,"
400,8,694,"And ev’ry chief had set on fire his tent,"
400,8,695,"When th’ other kings, in great Ulysses’ guide,"
400,8,696,"In Troy’s vast market place the horse did hide,"
400,8,697,From whence the Trojans up to Ilion drew
400,8,698,The dreadful engine. Where sat all arew
400,8,699,Their kings about it; many counsels giv’n
400,8,700,How to dispose it. In three ways were driv’n
400,8,701,"Their whole distractions. First, if they should feel"
400,8,702,"The hollow wood’s heart, search’d with piercing steel;"
400,8,703,Or from the battlements drawn higher yet
400,8,704,Deject it headlong; or that counterfeit
400,8,705,"So vast and novel set on sacred fire,"
400,8,706,Vow’d to appease each anger’d Godhead’s ire.
400,8,707,"On which opinion, they, thereafter, saw,"
400,8,708,They then should have resolv’d; th’ unalter’d law
400,8,709,"Of fate presaging, that Troy then should end,"
400,8,710,"When th’ hostile horse she should receive to friend,"
400,8,711,"For therein should the Grecian kings lie hid,"
400,8,712,To bring the fate and death they after did.
400,8,713,"He sung, besides, the Greeks’ eruptión"
400,8,714,"From those their hollow crafts, and horse foregone;"
400,8,715,And how they made depopulation tread
400,8,716,Beneath her feet so high a city’s head.
400,8,717,"In which affair, he sung in other place,"
400,8,718,That of that ambush some man else did race
400,8,719,The Ilion tow’rs than Laertiades;
400,8,720,"But here he sung, that he alone did seize,[10]"
400,8,721,"With Menelaus, the ascended roof"
400,8,722,"Of prince Deiphobus, and Mars - like proof"
400,8,723,"Made of his valour, a most dreadful fight"
400,8,724,"Daring against him; and there vanquish’d quite,"
400,8,725,"In little time, by great Minerva’s aid,"
400,8,726,"All Ilion’s remnant, and Troy level laid."
400,8,727,This the divine expressor did so give
400,8,728,"Both act and passion, that he made it live,"
400,8,729,And to Ulysses’ facts did breathe a fire
400,8,730,"So deadly quick’ning, that it did inspire[11]"
400,8,731,"Old death with life, and render’d life so sweet,"
400,8,732,"And passionate, that all there felt it fleet;"
400,8,733,"Which made him pity his own cruelty,"
400,8,734,And put into that ruth so pure an eye
400,8,735,"Of human frailty, that to see a man"
400,8,736,"Could so revive from death, yet no way can"
400,8,737,"Defend from death, his own quick pow’rs it made"
400,8,738,"Feel there death’s horrors, and he felt life fade,"
400,8,739,"In tears his feeling brain swet; for, in things[12]"
400,8,740,"That move past utt’rance, tears ope all their springs."
400,8,741,Nor are there in the pow’rs that all life bears
400,8,742,More true interpreters of all than tears.
400,8,743,"And as a lady mourns her sole - lov’d lord,"
400,8,744,"That fall’n before his city by the sword,"
400,8,745,Fighting to rescue from a cruel fate
400,8,746,"His town and children, and in dead estate"
400,8,747,"Yet panting seeing him, wraps him in her arms,"
400,8,748,"Weeps, shrieks, and pours her health into his arms,"
400,8,749,"Lies on him, striving to become his shield"
400,8,750,"From foes that still assail him, spears impell’d"
400,8,751,"Through back and shoulders, by whose points embrued,"
400,8,752,"They raise and lead him into servitude,"
400,8,753,"Labour, and languor; for all which the dame"
400,8,754,"Eats down her cheeks with tears, and feeds life’s flame"
400,8,755,With miserable suff’rance; so this king
400,8,756,Of tear - swet anguish op’d a boundless spring;
400,8,757,Nor yet was seen to any one man there
400,8,758,"But king Alcinous, who sat so near"
400,8,759,"He could not ‘scape him, sighs, so chok’d, so brake"
400,8,760,From all his tempers; which the king did take
400,8,761,"Both note and grave respect of, and thus spake:"
400,8,762,"“Hear me, Phæacian councillors and peers,"
400,8,763,And cease Demodocus; perhaps all ears
400,8,764,"Are not delighted with his song, for, ever"
400,8,765,"Since the divine Muse sung, ‘our guest hath never"
400,8,766,"Contain’d from secret mournings. It may fall,"
400,8,767,"That something sung he hath been grieved with all,"
400,8,768,"As touching his particular. Forbear,"
400,8,769,"That feast may jointly comfort all hearts here,"
400,8,770,And we may cheer our guest up; ’tis our best
400,8,771,In all due honour. For our rev’rend guest
400,8,772,"Is all our celebration, gifts, and all,"
400,8,773,His love hath added to our festival.
400,8,774,"A guest, and suppliant too, we should esteem"
400,8,775,"Dear as our brother, one that doth but dream"
400,8,776,"He hath a soul, or touch but at a mind"
400,8,777,"Deathless and manly, should stand so inclin’d."
400,8,778,"Nor cloak you longer with your curious wit,"
400,8,779,"Lov’d guest, what ever we shall ask of it."
400,8,780,"It now stands on your honest state to tell,"
400,8,781,"And therefore give your name, nor more conceal"
400,8,782,"What of your parents, and the town that bears"
400,8,783,"Name of your native, or of foreigners"
400,8,784,"That near us border, you are call’d in fame."
400,8,785,"There’s no man living walks without a name,"
400,8,786,"Noble nor base, but had one from his birth"
400,8,787,"Impos’d as fit as to be borne. What earth,"
400,8,788,"People, and city, own you, give to know."
400,8,789,"Tell but our ships all, that your way must show."
400,8,790,"For our ships know th’ expressed minds of men,"
400,8,791,And will so most intentively retain
400,8,792,"Their scopes appointed, that they never err,"
400,8,793,"And yet use never any man to steer,"
400,8,794,"Nor any rudders have, as others need."
400,8,795,"They know men’s thoughts, and whither tends their speed,"
400,8,796,And there will set them; for you cannot name[13]
400,8,797,"A city to them, nor fat soil, that Fame"
400,8,798,"Hath any notice giv’n, but well they know,"
400,8,799,"And they will fly to them, though they ebb and flow"
400,8,800,In blackest clouds and nights; and never bear
400,8,801,Of any wrack or rock the slend’rest fear.
400,8,802,But this I heard my sire Nausithous say.
400,8,803,"Long since, that Neptune, seeing us convey"
400,8,804,"So safely passengers of all degrees,"
400,8,805,Was angry with us; and upon our seas
400,8,806,"A well - built ship we had, near harbour come"
400,8,807,"From safe deduction of some stranger home,"
400,8,808,Made in his flitting billows stick stone still;
400,8,809,"And dimm’d our city, like a mighty hill"
400,8,810,"With shade cast round about it. This report,"
400,8,811,"The old king made;[14] in which miraculous sort,"
400,8,812,"If God had done such things, or left undone,"
400,8,813,"At his good pleasure be it. But now, on,"
400,8,814,"And truth relate us, both whence you err’d,"
400,8,815,"And to what clime of men would be transferr’d,"
400,8,816,"With all their fair towns, be they as they are,"
400,8,817,"If rude, unjust, and all irregular,"
400,8,818,"Or hospitable, bearing minds that please"
400,8,819,The mighty Deity. Which one of these
400,8,820,"You would be set at, say, and you are there."
400,8,821,"And therefore what afflicts you? Why, to hear"
400,8,822,"The fate of Greece and Ilion, mourn you so?"
400,8,823,The Gods have done it; as to all they do

400,8,829,"Or any friend perhaps, in whom did move"
400,8,830,"A knowing soul, and no unpleasing thing?"
400,8,831,Since such a good one is no underling

400,9,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,9,2,Ulysses here is first made known;
400,9,3,Who tells the stern contention
400,9,4,His pow’rs did ’gainst the Cicons try;
400,9,5,And thence to the Lotophagi
400,9,6,Extends his conquest; and from them
400,9,7,"Assays the Cyclop Polypheme,"
400,9,8,"And, by the crafts his wits apply,"
400,9,9,He puts him out his only eye.
400,9,10,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,9,11,_᾿Ιω̑τα._
400,9,12,The strangely fed
400,9,13,Lotophagi.
400,9,14,The Cicons fled.
400,9,15,The Cyclop’s eye.
400,9,16,Ulysses thus resolv’d the king’s demands:
400,9,17,"“Alcinous, in whom this empire stands,"
400,9,18,You should not of so natural right disherit
400,9,19,"Your princely feast, as take from it the spirit."
400,9,20,"To hear a poet, that in accent brings"
400,9,21,"The Gods’ breasts down, and breathes them as he sings,"
400,9,22,"Is sweet, and sacred; nor can I conceive,"
400,9,23,"In any common - weal, what more doth give"
400,9,24,"Note of the just and blessed empery,"
400,9,25,Than to see comfort universally
400,9,26,"Cheer up the people, when in ev’ry roof"
400,9,27,She gives observers a most human proof
400,9,28,Of men’s contents. To see a neighbour’s feast
400,9,29,Adorn it through; and thereat hear the breast
400,9,30,Of the divine Muse; men in order set;
400,9,31,"A wine - page waiting; tables crown’d with meat,"
400,9,32,Set close to guests that are to use it skill’d;
400,9,33,"The cup - boards furnish’d, and the cups still fill’d;"
400,9,34,"This shows, to my mind, most humanely fair."
400,9,35,"Nor should you, for me, still the heav’nly air,"
400,9,36,That stirr’d my soul so; for I love such tears
400,9,37,"As fall from fit notes, beaten through mine ears"
400,9,38,"With repetitions of what heav’n hath done,"
400,9,39,And break from hearty apprehensión
400,9,40,"Of God and goodness, though they show my ill."
400,9,41,"And therefore doth my mind excite me still,"
400,9,42,"To tell my bleeding moan; but much more now,"
400,9,43,"To serve your pleasure, that to over - flow"
400,9,44,"My tears with such cause may by sighs be driv’n,"
400,9,45,Though ne’er so much plagued I may seem by heav’n.
400,9,46,And now my name; which way shall lead to all
400,9,47,"My mis’ries after, that their sounds may fall"
400,9,48,"Through your ears also, and show (having fled"
400,9,49,"So much affliction) first, who rests his head"
400,9,50,"In your embraces, when, so far from home,"
400,9,51,I knew not where t’ obtain it resting room.
400,9,52,"I am Ulysses Laertiades,"
400,9,53,"The fear of all the world for policies,"
400,9,54,For which my facts as high as heav’n resound.
400,9,55,"I dwell in Ithaca, earth’s most renown’d,"
400,9,56,"All over - shadow’d with the shake - leaf hill,[1]"
400,9,57,Tree - fam’d Neritus; whose near confines fill
400,9,58,"Islands a number, well - inhabited,"
400,9,59,That under my observance taste their bread;
400,9,60,"Dulichius, Samos, and the full - of - food[2]"
400,9,61,"Zacynthus, likewise grac’d with store of wood."
400,9,62,"But Ithaca, though in the seas it lie,"
400,9,63,Yet lies she so aloft she casts her eye
400,9,64,Quite over all the neighbour continent;
400,9,65,"Far northward situate, and, being lent"
400,9,66,"But little favour of the morn and sun,"
400,9,67,With barren rocks and cliffs is over - run;
400,9,68,And yet of hardy youths a nurse of name;
400,9,69,"Nor could I see a soil, where’er I came,"
400,9,70,"More sweet and wishful. Yet, from hence was I"
400,9,71,"Withheld with horror by the Deity,"
400,9,72,"Divine Calypso, in her cavy house,"
400,9,73,Enflam’d to make me her sole lord and spouse.
400,9,74,"Circe Ææa too, that knowing dame,"
400,9,75,"Whose veins the like affections did enflame,"
400,9,76,Detain’d me likewise. But to neither’s love
400,9,77,"Could I be tempted; which doth well approve,"
400,9,78,"Nothing so sweet is as our country’s earth,[3]"
400,9,79,And joy of those from whom we claim our birth.
400,9,80,"Though roofs far richer we far off possess,"
400,9,81,"Yet, from our native, all our more is less."
400,9,82,"To which as I contended, I will tell"
400,9,83,The much - distress - conferring facts that fell
400,9,84,"By Jove’s divine prevention, since I set"
400,9,85,From ruin’d Troy my first foot in retreat.
400,9,86,From Ilion ill winds cast me on the coast
400,9,87,"The Cicons hold, where I employ’d mine host"
400,9,88,"For Ismarus, a city built just by"
400,9,89,My place of landing; of which victory
400,9,90,"Made me expugner. I depeopled it,"
400,9,91,"Slew all the men, and did their wives remit,"
400,9,92,"With much spoil taken; which we did divide,"
400,9,93,That none might need his part. I then applied
400,9,94,"All speed for flight; but my command therein,"
400,9,95,"Fools that they were, could no observance win"
400,9,96,"Of many soldiers, who, with spoil fed high,"
400,9,97,"Would yet fill higher, and excessively"
400,9,98,"Fell to their wine, gave slaughter on the shore"
400,9,99,Clov’n - footed beeves and sheep in mighty store.
400,9,100,"In mean space, Cicons did to Cicons cry,"
400,9,101,"When, of their nearest dwellers, instantly"
400,9,102,"Many and better soldiers made strong head,"
400,9,103,"That held the continent, and managéd"
400,9,104,"Their horse with high skill, on which they would fight,"
400,9,105,"When fittest cause serv’d, and again alight,"
400,9,106,"With soon seen vantage, and on foot contend."
400,9,107,"Their concourse swift was, and had never end;"
400,9,108,"As thick and sudden ’twas, as flow’rs and leaves"
400,9,109,"Dark spring discovers, when she light receives.[4]"
400,9,110,And then began the bitter Fate of Jove
400,9,111,"To alter us unhappy, which ev’n strove"
400,9,112,To give us suff’rance. At our fleet we made
400,9,113,Enforcéd stand; and there did they invade
400,9,114,"Our thrust - up forces; darts encounter’d darts,"
400,9,115,With blows on both sides; either making parts
400,9,116,"Good upon either, while the morning shone,"
400,9,117,"And sacred day her bright increase held on,"
400,9,118,Though much out - match’d in number; but as soon
400,9,119,"As Phœbus westward fell, the Cicons won"
400,9,120,"Much hand of us; six proved soldiers fell,"
400,9,121,"Of ev’ry ship, the rest they did compel!"
400,9,122,To seek of Flight escape from Death and Fate.
400,9,123,Thence sad in heart we sail’d; and yet our state
400,9,124,"Was something cheer’d, that (being o’er - match’d so much"
400,9,125,In violent number) our retreat was such
400,9,126,"As sav’d so many. Our dear loss the less,"
400,9,127,"That they surviv’d, so like for like success."
400,9,128,"Yet left we not the coast, before we call’d"
400,9,129,Home to our country - earth the souls exhal’d
400,9,130,Of all the friends the Cicons overcame.
400,9,131,"Thrice call’d we on them by their sev’ral name,[5]"
400,9,132,And then took leave. Then from the angry North
400,9,133,Cloud - gath’ring Jove a dreadful storm call’d forth
400,9,134,"Against our navy, cover’d shore and all"
400,9,135,With gloomy vapours. Night did headlong fall
400,9,136,From frowning heav’n. And then hurl’d here and there
400,9,137,Was all our navy; the rude winds did tear
400,9,138,"In three, in four parts, all their sails; and down"
400,9,139,"Driv’n under hatches were we, prest to drown."
400,9,140,"Up rush’d we yet again, and with tough hand"
400,9,141,"(Two days, two nights, entoil’d) we gat near land,"
400,9,142,Labours and sorrows eating up our minds.
400,9,143,"The third clear day yet, to more friendly winds"
400,9,144,"We masts advanc’d, we white sails spread, and sate."
400,9,145,Forewinds and guides again did iterate
400,9,146,"Our ease and home - hopes; which we clear had reach’d,"
400,9,147,"Had not, by chance, a sudden north - wind fetch’d,"
400,9,148,"With an extreme sea, quite about again"
400,9,149,"Our whole endeavours, and our course constrain"
400,9,150,"To giddy round, and with our bow’d sails greet"
400,9,151,"Dreadful Maleia, calling back our fleet"
400,9,152,As far forth as Cythera. Nine days more
400,9,153,"Adverse winds toss’d me; and the tenth, the shore,"
400,9,154,"Where dwelt the blossom - fed Lotophagi,"
400,9,155,"I fetch’d, fresh water took in, instantly"
400,9,156,"Fell to our food aship - board, and then sent"
400,9,157,Two of my choice men to the continent
400,9,158,"(Adding a third, a herald) to discover"
400,9,159,What sort of people were the rulers over
400,9,160,"The land next to us. Where, the first they met,"
400,9,161,"Were the Lotophagi, that made them eat"
400,9,162,"Their country - diet, and no ill intent"
400,9,163,Hid in their hearts to them; and yet th’ event
400,9,164,"To ill converted it, for having eat"
400,9,165,"Their dainty viands, they did quite forget"
400,9,166,(As all men else that did but taste their feast)
400,9,167,"Both countrymen and country, nor addrest"
400,9,168,Any return t’ inform what sort of men
400,9,169,"Made fix’d abode there, but would needs maintain"
400,9,170,"Abode themselves there, and eat that food ever."
400,9,171,"I made out after, and was feign to sever"
400,9,172,Th’ enchanted knot by forcing their retreat;
400,9,173,"That striv’d, and wept, and would not leave their meat"
400,9,174,"For heav’n itself. But, dragging them to fleet,"
400,9,175,"I wrapt in sure bands both their hands and feet,"
400,9,176,"And cast them under hatches, and away"
400,9,177,"Commanded all the rest without least stay,"
400,9,178,"Lest they should taste the lote too, and forget"
400,9,179,With such strange raptures their despis’d retreat.
400,9,180,"All then aboard, we beat the sea with oars,"
400,9,181,"And still with sad hearts sail’d by out - way shores,"
400,9,182,Till th’ out - law’d Cyclops’ land we fetch’d; a race
400,9,183,"Of proud - liv’d loiterers, that never sow,"
400,9,184,"Nor put a plant in earth, nor use a plow,"
400,9,185,"But trust in God for all things; and their earth,"
400,9,186,"Unsown, unplow’d, gives ev’ry offspring birth"
400,9,187,"That other lands have; wheat, and barley, vines"
400,9,188,That bear in goodly grapes delicious wines;
400,9,189,"And Jove sends show’rs for all. No councils there,"
400,9,190,"Nor councillors, nor laws; but all men bear"
400,9,191,"Their heads aloft on mountains, and those steep,"
400,9,192,And on their tops too; and their houses keep
400,9,193,"In vaulty caves, their households govern’d all"
400,9,194,"By each man’s law, impos’d in several,"
400,9,195,"Nor wife, nor child awed, but as he thinks good,"
400,9,196,None for another caring. But there stood
400,9,197,"Another little isle, well stor’d with wood,"
400,9,198,Betwixt this and the entry; neither nigh
400,9,199,"The Cyclops’ isle, nor yet far off doth lie,"
400,9,200,"Men’s want it suffer’d, but the men’s supplies"
400,9,201,The goats made with their inarticulate cries.
400,9,202,"Goats beyond number this small island breeds,"
400,9,203,"So tame, that no access disturbs their feeds,"
400,9,204,"No hunters, that the tops of mountains scale,"
400,9,205,"And rub through woods with toil, seek them at all."
400,9,206,"Nor is the soil with flocks fed down, not plow’d,"
400,9,207,Nor ever in it any seed was sow’d.
400,9,208,Nor place the neighbour Cyclops their delights
400,9,209,In brave vermilion - prow - deck’d ships; nor wrights
400,9,210,"Useful, and skilful in such works as need"
400,9,211,Perfection to those traffics that exceed
400,9,212,"Their natural confines, to fly out and see"
400,9,213,"Cities of men, and take in mutually"
400,9,214,"The prease of others; to themselves they live,"
400,9,215,And to their island that enough would give
400,9,216,A good inhabitant; and time of year
400,9,217,Observe to all things art could order there.
400,9,218,"There, close upon the sea, sweet meadows spring;"
400,9,219,That yet of fresh streams want no watering
400,9,220,"To their soft burthens, but of special yield."
400,9,221,Your vines would be there; and your common field
400,9,222,"But gentle work make for your plow, yet bear"
400,9,223,A lofty harvest when you came to shear;
400,9,224,For passing fat the soil is. In it lies
400,9,225,"A harbour so oppórtune, that no ties,"
400,9,226,"Halsers, or gables need, nor anchors cast."
400,9,227,"Whom storms put in there are with stay embrac’d,[6]"
400,9,228,"Or to their full wills safe, or winds aspire"
400,9,229,To pilots’ uses their more quick desire.
400,9,230,"At entry of the haven, a silver ford"
400,9,231,"Is from a rock - impressing fountain pour’d,"
400,9,232,All set with sable poplars. And this port
400,9,233,"Were we arriv’d at, by the sweet resort"
400,9,234,"Of some God guiding us, for ’twas a night"
400,9,235,"So ghastly dark all port was past our sight,"
400,9,236,"Clouds hid our ships, and would not let the moon"
400,9,237,"Afford a beam to us, the whole isle won"
400,9,238,"By not an eye of ours. None thought the blore,"
400,9,239,"That then was up, shov’d waves’ against the shore,"
400,9,240,That then to an unmeasur’d height put on;
400,9,241,"We still at sea esteem’d us, till alone"
400,9,242,Our fleet put in itself. And then were strook
400,9,243,"Our gather’d sails; our rest ashore we took,"
400,9,244,"And day expected. When the morn gave fire,"
400,9,245,"We rose, and walk’d, and did the isle admire;"
400,9,246,"The Nymphs, Jove’s daughters, putting up a herd"
400,9,247,"Of mountain goats to us, to render cheer’d"
400,9,248,"My fellow soldiers. To our fleet we flew,"
400,9,249,"Our crooked bows took, long - pil’d darts, and drew"
400,9,250,"Ourselves in three parts out; when, by the grace"
400,9,251,"That God vouchsaf’d, we made a gainful chace."
400,9,252,"Twelve ships we had, and ev’ry ship had nine"
400,9,253,"Fat goats allotted [it], ten only mine."
400,9,254,"Thus all that day, ev’n till the sun was set,"
400,9,255,"We sat and feasted, pleasant wine and meat"
400,9,256,Plenteously taking; for we had not spent
400,9,257,"Our ruddy wine aship - board, supplement"
400,9,258,"Of large sort each man to his vessel drew,"
400,9,259,When we the sacred city overthrew
400,9,260,That held the Cicons. Now then saw we near
400,9,261,"The Cyclops’ late - prais’d island, and might hear"
400,9,262,"The murmur of their sheep and goats, and see"
400,9,263,"Their smokes ascend. The sun then set, and we,"
400,9,264,"When night succeeded, took our rest ashore."
400,9,265,"And when the world the morning’s favour wore,"
400,9,266,"I call’d my friends to council, charging them"
400,9,267,"To make stay there, while I took ship and stream,"
400,9,268,"With some associates, and explor’d what men"
400,9,269,"The neighbour isle held; if of rude disdain,"
400,9,270,"Churlish and tyrannous, or minds bewray’d"
400,9,271,"Pious and hospitable. Thus much said,"
400,9,272,"I boarded, and commanded to ascend"
400,9,273,"My friends and soldiers, to put off, and lend"
400,9,274,"Way to our ship. They boarded, sat, and beat"
400,9,275,"The old sea forth, till we might see the seat"
400,9,276,"The greatest Cyclop held for his abode,"
400,9,277,"Which was a deep cave, near the common road"
400,9,278,"Of ships that touch’d there, thick with laurels spread,"
400,9,279,Where many sheep and goats lay shadowéd;
400,9,280,"And, near to this, a hall of torn - up stone,"
400,9,281,"High built with pines, that heav’n and earth attone,"
400,9,282,And lofty - fronted oaks; in which kept house
400,9,283,"A man in shape immane, and monsterous,"
400,9,284,"Fed all his flocks alone, nor would afford"
400,9,285,"Commerce with men, but had a wit abhorr’d,"
400,9,286,His mind his body answ’ring. Nor was he
400,9,287,Like any man that food could possibly
400,9,288,"Enhance so hugely, but, beheld alone,"
400,9,289,"Show’d like a steep hill’s top, all overgrown"
400,9,290,With trees and brambles; little thought had I
400,9,291,"Of such vast objects. When, arriv’d so nigh,"
400,9,292,"Some of my lov’d friends I made stay aboard,"
400,9,293,"To guard my ship; and twelve with me I shor’d,"
400,9,294,The choice of all. I took besides along
400,9,295,"A goat - skin flagon of wine, black and strong,"
400,9,296,"That Maro did present, Evantheus’ son,"
400,9,297,"And priest to Phœbus, who had mansión"
400,9,298,In Thracian Ismarus (the town I took).
400,9,299,"He gave it me, since I (with rev’rence strook"
400,9,300,"Of his grave place, his wife and children’s good)"
400,9,301,"Freed all of violence. Amidst a wood,"
400,9,302,"Sacred to Phœbus, stood his house; from whence"
400,9,303,He fetch’d me gifts of varied excellence;
400,9,304,Sev’n talents of fine gold; a bowl all fram’d
400,9,305,Of massy silver; but his gift most fam’d
400,9,306,"Was twelve great vessels, fill’d with such rich wine"
400,9,307,As was incorruptible and divine.
400,9,308,"He kept it as his jewel, which none knew"
400,9,309,"But he himself, his wife, and he that drew."
400,9,310,It was so strong that never any fill’d
400,9,311,"A cup, where that was but by drops instill’d,"
400,9,312,"And drunk it off, but ’twas before allay’d"
400,9,313,With twenty parts in water; yet so sway’d
400,9,314,"The spirit of that little, that the whole"
400,9,315,A sacred odour breath’d about the bowl.
400,9,316,"Had you the odour smelt and scent it cast,"
400,9,317,It would have vex’d you to forbear the taste.
400,9,318,"But then, the taste gain’d too, the spirit it wrought"
400,9,319,To dare things high set - up - an - end my thought.
400,9,320,"Of this a huge great flagon full I bore,"
400,9,321,"And, in a good large knapsack, victuals store;"
400,9,322,"And long’d to see this heap of fortitude,"
400,9,323,That so illit’rate was and upland rude
400,9,324,That laws divine nor human he had learn’d.
400,9,325,With speed we reach’d the cavern; nor discern’d
400,9,326,"His presence there, his flocks he fed at field."
400,9,327,"Ent’ring his den, each thing beheld did yield"
400,9,328,Our admiration; shelves with cheeses heap’d;
400,9,329,"Sheds stuff’d with lambs and goats, distinctly kept,"
400,9,330,"Distinct the biggest, the more mean distinct,"
400,9,331,"Distinct the youngest. And in their precinct,"
400,9,332,"Proper and placeful, stood the troughs and pails,"
400,9,333,"In which he milk’d; and what was giv’n at meals,"
400,9,334,Set up a creaming; in the ev’ning still
400,9,335,All scouring bright as dew upon the hill.
400,9,336,Then were my fellows instant to convey
400,9,337,"“Kids, cheeses, lambs, aship - board, and away"
400,9,338,"Sail the salt billow. I thought best not so,"
400,9,339,"But better otherwise; and first would know,"
400,9,340,What guest - gifts he would spare me. Little knew
400,9,341,My friends on whom they would have prey’d. His view
400,9,342,"Prov’d after, that his inwards were too rough"
400,9,343,For such bold usage. We were bold enough
400,9,344,"In what I suffer’d; which was there to stay,"
400,9,345,"Make fire and feed there, though bear none away."
400,9,346,"There sat we, till we saw him feeding come,"
400,9,347,"And on his neck a burthen lugging home,"
400,9,348,"Most highly huge, of sere - wood, which the pile"
400,9,349,That fed his fire supplied all supper - while.
400,9,350,"Down by his den he threw it, and up rose"
400,9,351,"A tumult with the fall. Afraid, we close"
400,9,352,"Withdrew ourselves, while he into a cave"
400,9,353,"Of huge receipt his high - fed cattle drave,"
400,9,354,All that he milk’d; the males he left without
400,9,355,"His lofty roofs, that all bestrow’d about"
400,9,356,With rams and buck - goats were. And then a rock
400,9,357,"He lift aloft, that damm’d up to his flock"
400,9,358,"The door they enter’d; ’twas so hard to wield,"
400,9,359,"That two - and - twenty waggons, all four - wheel’d,"
400,9,360,"(Could they be loaded, and have teams that were"
400,9,361,Proportion’d to them) could not stir it there.
400,9,362,"Thus making sure, he kneel’d and milk’d his ewes,"
400,9,363,"And braying goats, with all a milker’s dues;"
400,9,364,Then let in all their young. Then quick did dress
400,9,365,"His half milk up for cheese, and in a press"
400,9,366,"Of wicker press’d it; put in bowls the rest,"
400,9,367,"To drink and eat, and serve his supping feast."
400,9,368,"All works dispatch’d thus, he began his fire;"
400,9,369,"Which blown, he saw us, and did thus inquire:"
400,9,370,῾Ho! guests! What are ye? Whence sail ye these seas?
400,9,371,"Traffic, or rove ye, and like thieves oppress"
400,9,372,"Poor strange adventurers, exposing so"
400,9,373,"Your souls to danger, and your lives to woe?’"
400,9,374,"This utter’d he, when fear from our hearts took"
400,9,375,"The very life, to be so thunder - strook"
400,9,376,"With such a voice, and such a monster see;"
400,9,377,"But thus I answer’d: ‘Erring Grecians, we"
400,9,378,"From Troy were turning homewards, but by force"
400,9,379,"Of adverse winds, in far diverted course,"
400,9,380,"Such unknown ways took, and on rude seas toss’d,"
400,9,381,"As Jove decreed, are cast upon this coast,"
400,9,382,"Of Agamemnon, famous Atreus’ son,"
400,9,383,We boast ourselves the soldiers; who hath won[7]
400,9,384,"Renown that reacheth heav’n, to overthrow"
400,9,385,"So great a city, and to ruin so"
400,9,386,So many nations. Yet at thy knees lie
400,9,387,"Our prostrate bosoms, forc’d with pray’rs to try"
400,9,388,"If any hospitable right, or boon"
400,9,389,"Of other nature, such as have been won"
400,9,390,"By laws of other houses, thou wilt give."
400,9,391,"Rev’rence the Gods, thou great’st of all that live."
400,9,392,We suppliants are; and hospitable Jove
400,9,393,"Pours wreak on all whom pray’rs want pow’r to move,"
400,9,394,And with their plagues together will provide
400,9,395,That humble guests shall have their wants supplied.’
400,9,396,"He cruelly answer’d: ‘O thou fool,’ said he,"
400,9,397,"To come so far, and to importune me"
400,9,398,"With any God’s fear, or observéd love!"
400,9,399,"We Cyclops care not for your goat - fed Jove,"
400,9,400,Nor other Bless’d ones; we are better far.
400,9,401,"To Jove himself dare I bid open war,"
400,9,402,"To thee, and all thy fellows, if I please."
400,9,403,"But tell me, where’s the ship, that by the seas"
400,9,404,"Hath brought thee hither? If far off, or near,"
400,9,405,Inform me quickly.’ These his temptings were;
400,9,406,"But I too much knew not to know his mind,"
400,9,407,"And craft with craft paid, telling him the wind"
400,9,408,(Thrust up from sea by Him that shakes the shore)
400,9,409,"Had dash’d our ships against his rocks, and tore"
400,9,410,"Her ribs in pieces close upon his coast,"
400,9,411,"And we from high wrack sav’d, the rest were lost."
400,9,412,"He answer’d nothing, but rush’d in, and took"
400,9,413,"Two of my fellows up from earth, and strook"
400,9,414,Their brains against it. Like two whelps they flew
400,9,415,"About his shoulders, and did all embrue"
400,9,416,The blushing earth. No mountain lion tore
400,9,417,"Two lambs so sternly, lapp’d up all their gore"
400,9,418,"Gush’d from their torn - up bodies, limb by limb"
400,9,419,(Trembling with life yet) ravish’d into him.
400,9,420,"Both flesh and marrow - stufféd bones he eat,"
400,9,421,And ev’n th’ uncleanséd entrails made his meat.
400,9,422,"We, weeping, cast our hands to heav’n, to view"
400,9,423,"A sight so horrid. Desperation flew,"
400,9,424,"With all our after lives, to instant death,"
400,9,425,In our believ’d destruction. But when breath
400,9,426,"The fury of his appetite had got,"
400,9,427,"Because the gulf his belly reach’d his throat,"
400,9,428,"Man’s flesh, and goat’s milk, laying lay’r on lay’r,"
400,9,429,"Till near chok’d up was all the pass for air,"
400,9,430,"Along his den, among’st his cattle, down"
400,9,431,"He rush’d, and streak’d him. ‘When my mind was grown"
400,9,432,"Desp’rate to step in, draw my sword, and part"
400,9,433,His bosom where the strings about the heart
400,9,434,"Circle the liver, and add strength of hand."
400,9,435,"But that rash thought, more stay’d, did countermand,"
400,9,436,"For there we all had perish’d, since it past"
400,9,437,"Our pow’rs to lift aside a log so vast,"
400,9,438,As barr’d all outscape; and so sigh’d away
400,9,439,"The thought all night, expecting active day."
400,9,440,"Which come, he first of all his fire enflames,"
400,9,441,"Then milks his goats and ewes, then to their dams"
400,9,442,"Lets in their young, and, wondrous orderly,"
400,9,443,With manly haste dispatch’d his housewif’ry.
400,9,444,"Then to his breakfast, to which other two"
400,9,445,"Of my poor friends went; which eat, out then go"
400,9,446,"His herds and fat flocks, lightly putting by"
400,9,447,"The churlish bar, and clos’d it instantly;"
400,9,448,"For both those works with ease as much he did,"
400,9,449,As you would ope and shut your quiver lid.
400,9,450,With storms of whistlings then his flock he drave
400,9,451,Up to the mountains; and occasion gave
400,9,452,"For me to use my wits, which to their height"
400,9,453,"I striv’d to screw up, that a vengeance might"
400,9,454,"By some means fall from thence, and Pallas now"
400,9,455,Afford a full ear to my neediest vow.
400,9,456,This then my thoughts preferr’d: A huge club lay
400,9,457,"Close by his milk - house, which was now in way"
400,9,458,"To dry and season, being an olive - tree"
400,9,459,"Which late he fell’d, and, being green, must be"
400,9,460,"Made lighter for his manage. ’Twas so vast,"
400,9,461,"That we resembled it to some fit mast,"
400,9,462,To serve a ship of burthen that was driv’n
400,9,463,"With twenty oars, and had a bigness giv’n"
400,9,464,"To bear a huge sea. Full so thick, so tall,"
400,9,465,"We judg’d this club; which I, in part, hew’d small,"
400,9,466,And cut a fathom off. The piece I gave
400,9,467,"Amongst my soldiers, to take down, and shave;"
400,9,468,"Which done, I sharpen’d it at top, and then,"
400,9,469,"Harden’d in fire, I hid it in the den"
400,9,470,"Within a nasty dunghill reeking there,"
400,9,471,"Thick, and so moist it issued ev’rywhere."
400,9,472,Then made I lots cast by my friends to try
400,9,473,Whose fortune serv’d to dare the bor’d - out eye
400,9,474,Of that man - eater; and the lot did fall
400,9,475,"On four I wish’d to make my aid of all,"
400,9,476,"And I the fifth made, chosen like the rest."
400,9,477,"Then came the even, and he came from the feast"
400,9,478,"Of his fat cattle, drave in all; nor kept"
400,9,479,"One male abroad; if, or his memory slept"
400,9,480,"By Gods’ direct will, or of purpose was"
400,9,481,"His driving in of all then, doth surpass"
400,9,482,My comprehension. But he clos’d again
400,9,483,"The mighty bar, milk’d, and did still maintain"
400,9,484,All other observation as before.
400,9,485,"His work all done, two of my soldiers more"
400,9,486,"At once he snatch’d up, and to supper went."
400,9,487,"Then dar’d I words to him, and did present"
400,9,488,"A bowl of wine, with these words: ‘Cyclop! take"
400,9,489,"A bowl of wine, from my hand, that may make"
400,9,490,"Way for the man’s flesh thou hast eat, and show"
400,9,491,What drink our ship held; which in sacred vow
400,9,492,I offer to thee to take ruth on me
400,9,493,In my dismission home. Thy rages be
400,9,494,"Now no more sufferable. How shall men,"
400,9,495,"Mad and inhuman that thou art, again"
400,9,496,"Greet thy abode, and get thy actions grace,"
400,9,497,"If thus thou ragest, and eat’st up their race.’"
400,9,498,"He took, and drunk, and vehemently joy’d"
400,9,499,To taste the sweet cup; and again employ’d
400,9,500,"My flagon’s pow’rs, entreating more, and said:"
400,9,501,"῾Good guest, again afford my taste thy aid,"
400,9,502,"And let me know thy name, and quickly now,"
400,9,503,That in thy recompense I may bestow
400,9,504,"A hospitable gift on thy desert,"
400,9,505,And such a one as shall rejoice thy heart.
400,9,506,For to the Cyclops too the gentle earth
400,9,507,"Bears gen’rous wine, and Jove augments her birth,"
400,9,508,"In store of such, with show’rs; but this rich wine"
400,9,509,"Fell from the river, that is mere divine,"
400,9,510,Of nectar and ambrosia.’ This again
400,9,511,"I gave him, and again; nor could the fool abstain,"
400,9,512,But drunk as often. When the noble juice
400,9,513,"Had wrought upon his spirit, I then gave use"
400,9,514,"To fairer language, saying: ‘Cyclop! now,"
400,9,515,"As thou demand’st, I’ll tell my name, do thou"
400,9,516,Make good thy hospitable gift to me.
400,9,517,My name is No - Man; No - Man each degree
400,9,518,"Of friends, as well as parents, call my name.’"
400,9,519,"He answer’d, as his cruel soul became:"
400,9,520,‘No - Man! I’ll eat thee last of all thy friends;
400,9,521,And this is that in which so much amends
400,9,522,"I vow’d to thy deservings, thus shall be"
400,9,523,My hospitable gift made good to thee.’
400,9,524,"This said, he upwards fell, but then bent round"
400,9,525,"His fleshy neck; and Sleep, with all crowns crown’d,"
400,9,526,Subdued the savage. From his throat brake out
400,9,527,"My wine, with man’s - flesh gobbets, like a spout,"
400,9,528,"When, loaded with his cups, he lay and snor’d;"
400,9,529,"And then took I the club’s end up, and gor’d"
400,9,530,"The burning coal - heap, that the point might heat;"
400,9,531,"Confirm’d my fellow’s minds, lest Fear should let"
400,9,532,"Their vow’d assay, and make them fly my aid."
400,9,533,"Straight was the olive - lever, I had laid"
400,9,534,"Amidst the huge fire to get hard’ning, hot,"
400,9,535,"And glow’d extremely, though ’twas green; which got"
400,9,536,"From forth the cinders, close about me stood"
400,9,537,My hardy friends; but that which did the good
400,9,538,"Was God’s good inspiratión, that gave"
400,9,539,A spirit beyond the spirit they us’d to have;
400,9,540,"Who took the olive spar, made keen before,"
400,9,541,"And plung’d it in his eye, and up I bore,"
400,9,542,"Bent to the top close, and help’d pour it in,"
400,9,543,With all my forces. And as you have seen
400,9,544,"A ship - wright bore a naval beam, he oft"
400,9,545,"Thrusts at the auger’s froofe, works still aloft,"
400,9,546,"And at the shank help others, with a cord"
400,9,547,"Wound round about to make it sooner bor’d,"
400,9,548,All plying the round still; so into his eye
400,9,549,The fiery stake we labour’d to imply.
400,9,550,"Out gush’d the blood that scalded, his eye - ball"
400,9,551,"Thrust out a flaming vapour, that scorch’d all"
400,9,552,"His brows and eye - lids, his eye - strings did crack,"
400,9,553,As in the sharp and burning rafter brake.
400,9,554,"And as a smith, to harden any tool,"
400,9,555,"Broad axe, or mattock, in his trough doth cool"
400,9,556,"The red - hot substance, that so fervent is"
400,9,557,It makes the cold wave straight to seethe and hiss;
400,9,558,So sod and hiss’d his eye about the stake.
400,9,559,"He roar’d withal, and all his cavern brake"
400,9,560,"In claps like thunder. We did frighted fly,"
400,9,561,Dispers’d in corners. He from forth his eye
400,9,562,The fixed stake pluck’d; after which the blood
400,9,563,"Flow’d freshly forth; and, mad, he hurl’d the wood"
400,9,564,About his hovel. Out he then did cry
400,9,565,"For other Cyclops, that in caverns by"
400,9,566,Upon a windy promontory dwell’d;
400,9,567,"Who, hearing how impetuously he yell’d,"
400,9,568,"Rush’d ev’ry way about him, and inquir’d,"
400,9,569,"What ill afflicted him, that he exspir’d"
400,9,570,"Such horrid clamours, and in sacred Night"
400,9,571,"To break their sleeps so? Ask’d him, if his fright"
400,9,572,Came from some mortal that his flocks had driv’n?
400,9,573,"Or if by craft, or might, his death were giv’n?"
400,9,574,"He answer’d from his den: ‘By craft, nor might,"
400,9,575,"No - Man hath giv’n me death.’ They then said right,"
400,9,576,"‘If no man hurt thee, and thyself alone,"
400,9,577,That which is done to thee by Jove is done;
400,9,578,And what great Jove inflicts no man can fly.
400,9,579,"Pray to thy Father yet, a Deity,"
400,9,580,"And prove, from him if thou canst help acquire.’"
400,9,581,"Thus spake they, leaving him; when all - on - fire"
400,9,582,"My heart with joy was, that so well my wit"
400,9,583,"And name deceiv’d him; whom now pain did split,"
400,9,584,And groaning up and down he groping tried
400,9,585,"To find the stone, which found, he put aside;"
400,9,586,"But in the door sat, feeling if he could"
400,9,587,(As his sheep issued) on some man lay hold;
400,9,588,"Esteeming me a fool, that could devise"
400,9,589,No stratagem to ‘scape his gross surprise.
400,9,590,"But I, contending what I could invent"
400,9,591,My friends and me from death so eminent
400,9,592,"To get deliver’d, all my wiles I wove"
400,9,593,(Life being the subject) and did this approve:
400,9,594,"Fat fleecy rams, most fair, and great, lay there,"
400,9,595,That did a burden like a violet bear.[8]
400,9,596,"These, while this learn’d - in - villainy did sleep,"
400,9,597,"I yok’d with osiers cut there, sheep to sheep,"
400,9,598,"Three in a rank, and still the mid sheep bore"
400,9,599,"A man about his belly, the two more"
400,9,600,"March’d on his each side for defence. I then,"
400,9,601,"Choosing myself the fairest of the den,"
400,9,602,"His fleecy belly under - crept, embrac’d"
400,9,603,"His back, and in his rich wool wrapt me fast"
400,9,604,"With both my hands, arm’d with as fast a mind."
400,9,605,"And thus each man hung, till the morning shin’d;"
400,9,606,"Which come, he knew the hour, and let abroad"
400,9,607,"His male - flocks first, the females unmilk’d stood"
400,9,608,"Bleating and braying, their full bags so sore"
400,9,609,"With being unemptied, but their shepherd more"
400,9,610,With being unsighted; which was cause his mind
400,9,611,"Went not a milking. He, to wreak inclin’d,"
400,9,612,"The backs felt, as they pass’d, of those male dams,"
400,9,613,"Gross fool! believing, we would ride his rams!"
400,9,614,Nor ever knew that any of them bore
400,9,615,Upon his belly any man before.
400,9,616,"The last ram came to pass him, with his wool"
400,9,617,"And me together loaded to the full,"
400,9,618,"For there did I hang; and that ram he stay’d,"
400,9,619,"And me withal had in his hands, my head"
400,9,620,"Troubled the while, not causelessly, nor least."
400,9,621,"This ram he grop’d, and talk’d to: ‘Lazy beast!"
400,9,622,Why last art thou now? Thou hast never us’d
400,9,623,"To lag thus hindmost, but still first hast bruis’d"
400,9,624,"The tender blossom of a flow’r, and held"
400,9,625,"State in thy steps, both to the flood and field,"
400,9,626,"First still at fold at even, now last remain?"
400,9,627,"Dost thou not wish I had mine eye again,"
400,9,628,"Which that abhorr’d man No - Man did put out,"
400,9,629,"Assisted by his execrable rout,"
400,9,630,When he had wrought me down with wine? But he
400,9,631,Must not escape my wreak so cunningly.
400,9,632,"I would to heav’n thou knew’st, and could but speak,"
400,9,633,To tell me where he lurks now! I would break
400,9,634,"His brain about my cave, strew’d here and there,"
400,9,635,"To ease my heart of those foul ills, that were"
400,9,636,Th’ inflictions of a man I priz’d at nought.’
400,9,637,"Thus let he him abroad; when I, once brought"
400,9,638,"A little from his hold, myself first los’d,"
400,9,639,"And next my friends. Then drave we, and dispos’d,"
400,9,640,"His straight - legg’d fat fleece - bearers over land,"
400,9,641,Ev’n till they all were in my ship’s command;
400,9,642,"And to our lov’d friends show’d our pray’d - for sight,"
400,9,643,"Escap’d from death. But, for our loss, outright"
400,9,644,"They brake in tears; which with a look I stay’d,"
400,9,645,"And bade them take our boot in. They obey’d,"
400,9,646,"And up we all went, sat, and us’d our oars."
400,9,647,But having left as far the savage shores
400,9,648,"As one might hear a voice, we then might see"
400,9,649,The Cyclop at the haven; when instantly
400,9,650,"I stay’d our oars, and this insultance us’d:"
400,9,651,῾Cyclop! thou shouldst not have so much abus’d
400,9,652,"Thy monstrous forces, to oppose their least"
400,9,653,"Against a man immartial, and a guest,"
400,9,654,And eat his fellows. Thou mightst know there were
400,9,655,"Some ills behind, rude swain, for thee to bear,"
400,9,656,"That fear’d not to devour thy guests, and break"
400,9,657,"All laws of humans. Jove sends therefore wreak,"
400,9,658,"And all the Gods, by me.’ This blew the more"
400,9,659,His burning fury; when the top he tore
400,9,660,"From off a huge rock, and so right a throw"
400,9,661,"Made at our ship, that just before the prow"
400,9,662,"It overflew and fell, miss’d mast and all"
400,9,663,Exceeding little; but about the fall
400,9,664,"So fierce a wave it rais’d, that back it bore"
400,9,665,"Our ship so far, it almost touch’d the shore."
400,9,666,"A bead - hook then, a far - extended one,"
400,9,667,"I snatch’d up, thrust hard, and so set us gone"
400,9,668,Some little way; and straight commanded all
400,9,669,"To help me with their oars, on pain to fall"
400,9,670,Again on our confusion. But a sign
400,9,671,"I with my head made, and their oars were mine"
400,9,672,"In all performance. When we off were set,"
400,9,673,"(Then first, twice further) my heart was so great,"
400,9,674,"It would again provoke him, but my men"
400,9,675,"On all sides rush’d about me, to contain,"
400,9,676,And said: ‘Unhappy! why will you provoke
400,9,677,"A man so rude, that with so dead a stroke,"
400,9,678,"Giv’n with his rock - dart, made the sea thrust back"
400,9,679,"Our ship so far, and near hand forc’d our wrack?"
400,9,680,"Should he again but hear your voice resound,"
400,9,681,"And any word reach, thereby would be found"
400,9,682,"His dart’s direction, which would, in his fall,"
400,9,683,"Crush piece - meal us, quite split our ship and all;"
400,9,684,So much dart wields the monster.’ Thus urg’d they
400,9,685,"Impossible things, in fear; but I gave way"
400,9,686,"To that wrath which so long I held deprest,"
400,9,687,"By great necessity conquer’d, in my breast:"
400,9,688,"‘Cyclop! if any ask thee, who impos’d[9]"
400,9,689,"Th’ unsightly blemish that thine eye enclos’d,"
400,9,690,"Say that Ulysses, old Laertes’ son,"
400,9,691,"Whose seat is Ithaca, and who hath won"
400,9,692,"Surname of City - razer, bor’d it out.’"
400,9,693,"At this, he bray’d so loud, that round about"
400,9,694,"He drave affrighted echoes through the air,"
400,9,695,"And said: ‘O beast! I was premonish’d fair,"
400,9,696,"By aged prophecy, in one that was"
400,9,697,"A great and good man, this should come to pass;"
400,9,698,"And how ’tis prov’d now! Augur Telemus,"
400,9,699,Surnam’d Eurymides (that spent with us
400,9,700,"His age in augury, and did exceed"
400,9,701,In all presage of truth) said all this deed
400,9,702,"Should this event take, author’d by the hand"
400,9,703,"Of one Ulysses, who I thought was mann’d"
400,9,704,"With great and goodly personage, and bore"
400,9,705,A virtue answerable; and this shore
400,9,706,Should shake with weight of such a conqueror;
400,9,707,"When now a weakling came, a dwarfy thing,"
400,9,708,"A thing of nothing; who yet wit did bring,"
400,9,709,"That brought supply to all, and with his wine"
400,9,710,Put out the flame where all my light did shine.
400,9,711,"Come, land again, Ulysses! that my hand"
400,9,712,"May guest - rites give thee, and the great command,"
400,9,713,"That Neptune hath at sea, I may convert"
400,9,714,"To the deduction where abides thy heart,"
400,9,715,"With my solicitings, whose son I am,"
400,9,716,And whose fame boasts to bear my father’s name.
400,9,717,"Nor think my hurt offends me, for my sire"
400,9,718,"Can soon repose in it the visual fire,"
400,9,719,At his free pleasure; which no pow’r beside
400,9,720,"Can boast, of men, or of the Deified.’"
400,9,721,I answer’d: ‘Would to God! I could compell
400,9,722,"Both life and soul from thee, and send to hell"
400,9,723,Those spoils of nature! Hardly Neptune then
400,9,724,"Could cure thy hurt, and give thee all again.’"
400,9,725,"Then flew fierce vows to Neptune, both his hands"
400,9,726,To star - born heav’n cast: ‘O thou that all lands
400,9,727,"Gird’st in thy ambient circle, and in air"
400,9,728,"Shak’st the curl’d tresses of thy sapphire hair,"
400,9,729,"If I be thine, or thou mayst justly vaunt"
400,9,730,"Thou art my father, hear me now, and grant"
400,9,731,"That this Ulysses, old Laertes’ son,"
400,9,732,"That dwells in Ithaca, and name hath won"
400,9,733,"Of City - ruiner, may never reach"
400,9,734,His natural region. Or if to fetch
400,9,735,"That, and the sight of his fair roofs and friends,"
400,9,736,"Be fatal to him, let him that amends"
400,9,737,"For all his miseries, long time and ill,"
400,9,738,"Smart for, and fail of; nor that fate fulfill,"
400,9,739,Till all his soldiers quite are cast away
400,9,740,"In others’ ships. And when, at last, the day"
400,9,741,"Of his sole - landing shall his dwelling show,"
400,9,742,Let Detriment prepare him wrongs enow.’
400,9,743,"Thus pray’d he Neptune; who, his sire, appear’d,"
400,9,744,And all his pray’r to ev’ry syllable heard.
400,9,745,"But then a rock, in size more amplified"
400,9,746,"Than first, he ravish’d to him, and implied"
400,9,747,"A dismal strength in it, when, wheel’d about,"
400,9,748,He sent it after us; nor flew it out
400,9,749,"From any blind aim, for a little pass"
400,9,750,"Beyond our fore - deck from the fall there was,"
400,9,751,"With which the sea our ship gave back upon,"
400,9,752,"And shrunk up into billows from the stone,"
400,9,753,Our ship again repelling near as near
400,9,754,"The shore as first. But then our rowers were,"
400,9,755,"Being warn’d, more arm’d, and stronglier stemm’d the flood"
400,9,756,"That bore back on us, till our ship made good"
400,9,757,"The other island, where our whole fleet lay,"
400,9,758,"In which our friends lay mourning for our stay,"
400,9,759,And ev’ry minute look’d when we should land.
400,9,760,"Where, now arriv’d, we drew up to the sand,"
400,9,761,"The Cyclops’ sheep dividing, that none there"
400,9,762,"Of all our privates might be wrung, and bear"
400,9,763,Too much on pow’r. The ram yet was alone
400,9,764,By all my friends made all my portion
400,9,765,Above all others; and I made him then
400,9,766,A sacrifice for me and all my men[10]
400,9,767,"To cloud - compelling Jove that all commands,"
400,9,768,To whom I burn’d the thighs; but my sad hands
400,9,769,"Receiv’d no grace from him, who studied how"
400,9,770,To offer men and fleet to overthrow.
400,9,771,"All day, till sun - set, yet, we sat and eat,"

400,9,773,"The sun then down, and place resign’d to shade,"
400,9,774,"We slept. Morn came, my men I rais’d, and made"
400,9,775,"All go aboard, weigh anchor, and away."
400,9,776,"They boarded, sat, and beat the aged sea;"
400,9,777,"And forth we made sail, sad for loss before,"

400,10,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,10,2,Ulysses now relates to us
400,10,3,"The grace he had with Æolus,"
400,10,4,Great Guardian of the hollow Winds;
400,10,5,"Which in a leather bag he binds,"
400,10,6,"And gives Ulysses; all but one,"
400,10,7,"Which Zephyr was, who fill’d alone"
400,10,8,"Ulysses’ sails. The bag once seen,"
400,10,9,"While he slept, by Ulysses’ men,"
400,10,10,"They thinking it did gold enclose,"
400,10,11,"To find it, all the winds did loose,"
400,10,12,Who back flew to their Guard again.
400,10,13,Forth sail’d he; and did next attain
400,10,14,To where the Læstrygonians dwell.
400,10,15,"Where he eleven ships lost, and fell"
400,10,16,"On the Ææan coast, whose shore"
400,10,17,"He sends Eurylochus t’ explore,"
400,10,18,Dividing with him half his men.
400,10,19,"Who go, and turn no more again,"
400,10,20,"All, save Eurylochus, to swine"
400,10,21,By Circe turn’d. Their stays incline
400,10,22,Ulysses to their search; who got
400,10,23,"Of Mercury an antidote,"
400,10,24,"Which moly was, ’gainst Circe’s charms,"
400,10,25,And so avoids his soldiers’ harms.
400,10,26,"A year with Circe all remain,"
400,10,27,And then their native forms regain.
400,10,28,"On utter shores a time they dwell,"
400,10,29,While Ithacus descends to hell.
400,10,30,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,10,31,_Κάππα._
400,10,32,"Great Æolus,"
400,10,33,"And Circe, friends"
400,10,34,Finds Ithacus;
400,10,35,And hell descends.
400,10,36,"“To the Æolian island we attain’d,"
400,10,37,"That swum about still on the sea, where reign’d"
400,10,38,The God - lov’d Æolus Hippotades.
400,10,39,A wall of steel it had; and in the seas
400,10,40,A wave - beat - smooth rock mov’d about the wall.
400,10,41,Twelve children in his house imperial
400,10,42,"Were born to him; of which six daughters were,"
400,10,43,"And six were sons, that youth’s sweet flow’r did bear."
400,10,44,His daughters to his sons he gave as wives;
400,10,45,"Who spent in feastful comforts all their lives,"
400,10,46,Close seated by their sire and his grave spouse.
400,10,47,Past number were the dishes that the house
400,10,48,Made ever savour; and still full the hall
400,10,49,"As long as day shin’d; in the night - time, all"
400,10,50,"Slept with their chaste wives, each his fair carv’d bed"
400,10,51,Most richly furnish’d; and this life they led.
400,10,52,"We reach’d the city and fair roofs of these,"
400,10,53,"Where, a whole month’s time, all things that might please"
400,10,54,"The king vouchsaf’d us; of great Troy inquir’d,"
400,10,55,"The Grecian fleet, and how the Greeks retir’d."
400,10,56,To all which I gave answer as behov’d.
400,10,57,"The fit time come when I dismission mov’d,"
400,10,58,"He nothing would deny me, but addrest"
400,10,59,"My pass with such a bounty, as might best"
400,10,60,Teach me contentment; for he did enfold
400,10,61,"Within an ox - hide, flay’d at nine years old,"
400,10,62,All th’ airy blasts that were of stormy kinds.
400,10,63,"Saturnius made him Steward of his Winds,"
400,10,64,And gave him pow’r to raise and to assuage.
400,10,65,"And these he gave me, curb’d thus of their rage,"
400,10,66,"Which in a glitt’ring silver band I bound,"
400,10,67,"And hung - up in my ship, enclos’d so round"
400,10,68,That no egression any breath could find;
400,10,69,"Only he left abroad the Western Wind,"
400,10,70,"To speed our ships, and us with blasts secure."
400,10,71,But our securities made all unsure;
400,10,72,"Nor could he consummate our course alone,"
400,10,73,When all the rest had got egressión;
400,10,74,Which thus succeeded: Nine whole days and nights
400,10,75,"We sail’d in safety; and the tenth, the lights"
400,10,76,"Borne on our country - earth we might descry,"
400,10,77,"So near we drew; and yet ev’n then fell I,"
400,10,78,"Being overwatch’d, into a fatal sleep,"
400,10,79,For I would suffer no man else to keep
400,10,80,"The foot that rul’d my vessel’s course, to lead[1]"
400,10,81,The faster home. My friends then Envy fed
400,10,82,"About the bag I hung - up, and suppos’d"
400,10,83,"That gold and silver I had there enclos’d,"
400,10,84,"As gift from Æolus, and said: ‘O heav’n!"
400,10,85,What grace and grave price is by all men giv’n
400,10,86,To our commander! Whatsoever coast
400,10,87,"Or town he comes to, how much he engrost"
400,10,88,"Of fair and precious prey, and brought from Troy!"
400,10,89,"We the same voyage went, and yet enjoy"
400,10,90,In our return these empty hands for all.
400,10,91,"This bag, now, Æolus was so liberal"
400,10,92,To make a guest - gift to him; let us try
400,10,93,"Of what consists the fair - bound treasury,"
400,10,94,And how much gold and silver it contains.’
400,10,95,_Ill counsel present approbation gains._
400,10,96,"They op’d the bag, and out the vapours brake,"
400,10,97,"When instant tempest did our vessel take,"
400,10,98,"That bore us back to sea, to mourn anew"
400,10,99,"Our absent country. Up amaz’d I flew,"
400,10,100,And desp’rate things discours’d; if I should cast
400,10,101,"Myself to ruin in the seas, or taste"
400,10,102,"Amongst the living more moan, and sustain?"
400,10,103,"Silent, I did so, and lay hid again"
400,10,104,"Beneath the hatches, while an ill wind took"
400,10,105,"My ships back to Æolia, my men strook"
400,10,106,"With woe enough. We pump’d and landed then,"
400,10,107,"Took food, for all this; and of all my men"
400,10,108,"I took a herald to me, and away"
400,10,109,"Went to the court of Æolus, where they"
400,10,110,"Were feasting still; he, wife, and children, set"
400,10,111,Together close. We would not at their meat
400,10,112,Thrust in; but humbly on the threshold sat.
400,10,113,"He then, amaz’d, my presence wonder’d at,"
400,10,114,And call’d to me: ‘Ulysses! How thus back
400,10,115,Art thou arriv’d here? What foul spirit brake
400,10,116,"Into thy bosom, to retire thee thus?"
400,10,117,We thought we had deduction curious
400,10,118,"Giv’n thee before, to reach thy shore and home;"
400,10,119,"Did it not like thee?’ I, ev’n overcome"
400,10,120,"With worthy sorrow, answer’d: ‘My ill men"
400,10,121,"Have done me mischief, and to them hath been"
400,10,122,"My sleep th’ unhappy motive; but do you,"
400,10,123,"Dearest of friends, deign succour to my vow."
400,10,124,Your pow’rs command it.’ Thus endeavour’d I
400,10,125,With soft speech to repair my misery.
400,10,126,The rest with ruth sat dumb. But thus spake he:
400,10,127,"‘Avaunt, and quickly quit my land of thee,"
400,10,128,Thou worst of all that breathe. It fits not me
400,10,129,"To convoy, and take - in, whom Heav’ns expose."
400,10,130,"Away, and with thee go the worst of woes,"
400,10,131,"That seek’st my friendship, and the Gods thy foes.’"
400,10,132,"Thus he dismiss’d me sighing. Forth we sail’d,"
400,10,133,At heart afflicted. And now wholly fail’d
400,10,134,"The minds my men sustain’d, so spent they were"
400,10,135,"With toiling at their oars, and worse did bear"
400,10,136,Their growing labours; and they caus’d their grought
400,10,137,By self - will’d follies; nor now ever thought
400,10,138,To see their country more. Six nights and days
400,10,139,We sail’d; the seventh we saw fair Lamos raise
400,10,140,"Her lofty tow’rs, the Læstrygonian state"
400,10,141,That bears her ports so far disterminate;
400,10,142,"Where shepherd shepherd calls out, he at home[2]"
400,10,143,Is call’d out by the other that doth come
400,10,144,"From charge abroad, and then goes he to sleep,"
400,10,145,The other issuing; he whose turn doth keep
400,10,146,"The night observance hath his double hire,"
400,10,147,Since day and night in equal length expire
400,10,148,"About that region, and the night’s watch weigh’d"
400,10,149,"At twice the day’s ward, since the charge that’s laid"
400,10,150,Upon the night’s - man (besides breach of sleep)
400,10,151,"Exceeds the days - man’s; for one oxen keep,"
400,10,152,"The other sheep. But when the haven we found,"
400,10,153,"(Exceeding famous, and environ’d round"
400,10,154,"With one continuate rock, which so much bent"
400,10,155,"That both ends almost met, so prominent"
400,10,156,"They were, and made the haven’s mouth passing strait)"
400,10,157,Our whole fleet in we got; in whose receit
400,10,158,Our ships lay anchor’d close. Nor needed we
400,10,159,"Fear harm on any stays, Tranquillity[3]"
400,10,160,"So purely sat there, that waves great nor small"
400,10,161,Did ever rise to any height at all.
400,10,162,"And yet would I no entry make, but stay’d"
400,10,163,"Alone without the haven, and thence survey’d,"
400,10,164,"From out a lofty watch - tow’r raised there,"
400,10,165,The country round about; nor anywhere
400,10,166,"The work of man or beast appear’d to me,"
400,10,167,Only a smoke from earth break I might see.
400,10,168,"I then made choice of two, and added more,"
400,10,169,"A herald for associate, to explore"
400,10,170,"What sort of men liv’d there. They went, and saw"
400,10,171,"A beaten way, through which carts us’d to draw"
400,10,172,"Wood from the high hills to the town, and met"
400,10,173,"A maid without the port, about to get"
400,10,174,Some near spring - water. She the daughter was
400,10,175,"Of mighty Læstrygonian Antiphas,"
400,10,176,"And to the clear spring call’d Artacia went,"
400,10,177,To which the whole town for their water sent.
400,10,178,"To her they came, and ask’d who govern’d there,"
400,10,179,And what the people whom he order’d were?
400,10,180,"She answer’d not, but led them through the port,"
400,10,181,As making haste to show her father’s court.
400,10,182,"Where enter’d, they beheld, to their affright,"
400,10,183,"A woman like a mountain - top in height,"
400,10,184,"Who rush’d abroad, and from the council - place"
400,10,185,"Call’d home her horrid husband Antiphas,[4]"
400,10,186,"Who, deadly - minded, straight he snatch’d up one,"
400,10,187,And fell to supper. Both the rest were gone;
400,10,188,And to the fleet came. Antiphas a cry
400,10,189,"Drave through the city; which heard, instantly"
400,10,190,"This way and that innumerable sorts,"
400,10,191,"Not men, but giants, issued through the ports,"
400,10,192,"And mighty flints from rocks tore, which they threw"
400,10,193,Amongst our ships; through which an ill noise flew
400,10,194,"Of shiver’d ships, and life - expiring men,"
400,10,195,"That were, like fishes, by the monsters slain,"
400,10,196,"And borne to sad feast. While they slaughter’d these,"
400,10,197,That were engag’d in all th’ advantages
400,10,198,"The close - mouth’d and most dead - calm haven could give,"
400,10,199,"I, that without lay, made some means to live,"
400,10,200,"My sword drew, cut my gables, and to oars"
400,10,201,"Set all my men; and, from the plagues those shores"
400,10,202,"Let fly amongst us, we made haste to fly,"
400,10,203,My men close working as men loth to die.
400,10,204,My ship flew freely off; but theirs that lay
400,10,205,On heaps in harbours could enforce no way
400,10,206,Through these stern fates that had engag’d them there.
400,10,207,"Forth our sad remnant sail’d, yet still retain’d"
400,10,208,"The joys of men, that our poor few remain’d."
400,10,209,"Then to the isle Ææa we attain’d,"
400,10,210,"Where fair - hair’d, dreadful, eloquent Circe reign’d,"
400,10,211,"Ææta’s sister both by dame and sire,"
400,10,212,"Both daughters to Heav’n’s man - enlight’ning Fire,"
400,10,213,"And Perse, whom Oceanus begat,"
400,10,214,"The ship - fit port here soon we landed at,"
400,10,215,"Some God directing us. Two days, two nights,"
400,10,216,We lay here pining in the fatal spights
400,10,217,Of toil and sorrow; but the next third day
400,10,218,"When fair Aurora had inform’d, quick way"
400,10,219,"I made out of my ship, my sword and lance"
400,10,220,"Took for my surer guide, and made advance"
400,10,221,Up to a prospect; I assay to see
400,10,222,"The works of men, or hear mortality"
400,10,223,"Exspire a voice. When I had climb’d a height,"
400,10,224,"Rough and right hardly accessible, I might"
400,10,225,"Behold from Circe’s house, that in a grove"
400,10,226,"Set thick with trees stood, a bright vapour move,"
400,10,227,I then grew curious in my thought to try[5]
400,10,228,"Some fit inquiry, when so spritely fly"
400,10,229,I saw the yellow smoke; but my discourse[6]
400,10,230,"A first retiring to my ship gave force,"
400,10,231,"To give my men their dinner, and to send"
400,10,232,(Before th’ adventure of myself) some friend.
400,10,233,"Being near my ship, of one so desolate"
400,10,234,"Some God had pity, and would recreate"
400,10,235,"My woes a little, putting up to me"
400,10,236,"A great and high - palm’d hart, that (fatally,"
400,10,237,Just in my way itself to taste a flood)
400,10,238,Was then descending; the sun heat had sure
400,10,239,"Importun’d him, besides the temperature"
400,10,240,"His natural heat gave. Howsoever, I"
400,10,241,"Made up to him, and let my jav’lin fly,"
400,10,242,"That struck him through the mid - part of his chine,"
400,10,243,"And made him, braying, to the dust confine"
400,10,244,His flying forces. Forth his spirit flew;
400,10,245,"When I stept in, and from the death’s wound drew"
400,10,246,My shrewdly - bitten lance; there let him lie
400,10,247,"Till I, of cut - up osiers, did imply"
400,10,248,"A withe a fathom long, with which his feet"
400,10,249,"I made together in a sure league meet,"
400,10,250,"Stoop’d under him, and to my neck I heav’d"
400,10,251,"The mighty burden, of which I receiv’d"
400,10,252,"A good part on my lance, for else I could"
400,10,253,By no means with one hand alone uphold
400,10,254,(Join’d with one shoulder) such a deathful load.
400,10,255,"And so, to both my shoulders, both hands stood"
400,10,256,Needful assistants; for it was a deer
400,10,257,Goodly - well - grown. When (coming something near
400,10,258,"Where rode my ships) I cast it down, and rear’d"
400,10,259,"My friends with kind words; whom by name I cheer’d,"
400,10,260,"In note particular, and said: ‘See, friends,"
400,10,261,We will not yet to Pluto’s house; our ends
400,10,262,"Shall not be hasten’d, though we be declin’d"
400,10,263,"In cause of comfort, till the day design’d"
400,10,264,"By Fate’s fix’d finger. Come, as long as food"
400,10,265,"Or wine lasts in our ship, let’s spirit our blood,"
400,10,266,And quit our care and hunger both in one.’
400,10,267,"This said, they frolick’d, came, and look’d upon"
400,10,268,With admiration the huge - bodied beast;
400,10,269,"And when their first - serv’d eyes had done their feast,"
400,10,270,"They wash’d, and made a to - be - striv’d - for meal[7]"
400,10,271,In point of honour. On which all did dwell
400,10,272,"The whole day long. And, to our venison’s store,"
400,10,273,We added wine till we could wish no more.
400,10,274,"Sun set, and darkness up, we slept, till light"
400,10,275,Put darkness down; and then did I excite
400,10,276,"My friends to counsel, utt’ring this: ‘Now, friends,[8]"
400,10,277,Afford unpassionate ear; though ill Fate lends
400,10,278,"So good cause to your passion, no man knows"
400,10,279,The reason whence and how the darkness grows;
400,10,280,The reason how the morn is thus begun;
400,10,281,The reason how the man - enlight’ning sun
400,10,282,Dives under earth; the reason how again
400,10,283,"He rears his golden head. Those counsels, then,"
400,10,284,"That pass our comprehension, we must leave"
400,10,285,To him that knows their causes; and receive
400,10,286,"Direction from him in our acts, as far"
400,10,287,"As he shall please to make them regular,"
400,10,288,And stoop them to our reason. In our state
400,10,289,"What then behoves us? Can we estimate,"
400,10,290,"With all our counsels, where we are? Or know"
400,10,291,"(Without instruction, past our own skills) how,"
400,10,292,"Put off from hence, to steer our course the more?"
400,10,293,I think we cannot. We must then explore
400,10,294,These parts for information; in which way
400,10,295,We thus far are: Last morn I might display
400,10,296,(From off a high - rais’d cliff) an island lie
400,10,297,"Girt with th’ unmeasur’d sea, and is so nigh"
400,10,298,That in the midst I saw the smoke arise
400,10,299,"Through tufts of trees. This rests then to advise,"
400,10,300,"Who shall explore this?’ This struck dead their hearts,"
400,10,301,Rememb’ring the most execrable parts
400,10,302,"That Læstrygonian Antiphas had play’d,"
400,10,303,And that foul Cyclop that their fellows bray’d
400,10,304,"Betwixt his jaws; which mov’d them so, they cried."
400,10,305,But idle tears had never wants supplied.
400,10,306,"I in two parts divided all, and gave"
400,10,307,To either part his captain. I must have
400,10,308,"The charge of one; and one of God - like look,"
400,10,309,"Eurylochus, the other. Lots we shook,"
400,10,310,"Put in a casque together, which of us"
400,10,311,Should lead th’ attempt; and ’twas Eurylochus.
400,10,312,"He freely went, with two - and - twenty more;"
400,10,313,All which took leave with tears; and our eyes wore
400,10,314,The same wet badge of weak humanity.
400,10,315,"These in a dale did Circe’s house descry,"
400,10,316,"Of bright stone built, in a conspicuous way."
400,10,317,"Before her gates hill - wolves, and lions, lay;"
400,10,318,"Which with her virtuous drugs so tame she made,"
400,10,319,That wolf nor lion would one man invade
400,10,320,"With any violence, but all arose,"
400,10,321,"Their huge long tails wagg’d, and in fawns would close,"
400,10,322,"As loving dogs, when masters bring them home"
400,10,323,"Relics of feast, in all observance come,"
400,10,324,"And soothe their entries with their fawns and bounds,"
400,10,325,All guests still bringing some scraps for their hounds;
400,10,326,"So, on these men, the wolves and lions ramp’d,"
400,10,327,Their horrid paws set up. Their spirits were damp’d
400,10,328,"To see such monstrous kindness, stay’d at gate,"
400,10,329,And heard within the Goddess elevate
400,10,330,"A voice divine, as at her web she wrought,"
400,10,331,"Subtle, and glorious, and past earthly thought,"
400,10,332,As all the housewif’ries of Deities are.
400,10,333,"To hear a voice so ravishingly rare,"
400,10,334,"Polités (one exceeding dear to me,"
400,10,335,"A prince of men, and of no mean degree"
400,10,336,"In knowing virtue, in all acts whose mind[9]"
400,10,337,"Discreet cares all ways us’d to turn, and wind)"
400,10,338,"Was yet surpris’d with it, and said: ‘O friends,"
400,10,339,"Some one abides within here, that commends"
400,10,340,"The place to us, and breathes a voice divine,"
400,10,341,"As she some web wrought, or her spindle’s twine"
400,10,342,She cherish’d with her song; the pavement rings
400,10,343,With imitation of the tunes she sings.
400,10,344,"Some woman, or some Goddess, ’tis. Assay"
400,10,345,"To see with knocking.’ Thus said he, and they"
400,10,346,"Both knock’d, and call’d; and straight her shining gates"
400,10,347,"She open’d, issuing, bade them in to cates."
400,10,348,"Led, and unwise, they follow’d; all but one,"
400,10,349,"Which was Eurylochus, who stood alone"
400,10,350,"Without the gates, suspicious of a sleight."
400,10,351,"They enter’d, she made sit; and her deceit"
400,10,352,"She cloak’d with thrones, and goodly chairs of state;"
400,10,353,"Set herby honey, and the delicate"
400,10,354,"Wine brought from Smynra, to them; meal and cheese;"
400,10,355,"But harmful venoms she commix’d with these,"
400,10,356,That made their country vanish from their thought.
400,10,357,"Which eat, she touch’d them with a rod that wrought"
400,10,358,Their transformation far past human wonts;
400,10,359,"Swine’s snouts, swine’s bodies, took they, bristles, grunts,"
400,10,360,"But still retain’d the souls they had before,"
400,10,361,Which made them mourn their bodies’ change the more.
400,10,362,"She shut them straight in styes, and gave them meat,"
400,10,363,"Oak - mast, and beech, and cornel - fruit, they eat,"
400,10,364,"Grov’lling like swine on earth, in foulest sort."
400,10,365,Eurylochus straight hasted the report
400,10,366,"Of this his fellows’ most remorseful fate,"
400,10,367,"Came to the ships, but so excruciate"
400,10,368,"Was with his woe, he could not speak a word,"
400,10,369,"His eyes stood full of tears, which show’d how stor’d"
400,10,370,"His mind with moan remain’d. We all admir’d,"
400,10,371,"Ask’d what had chanc’d him, earnestly desir’d"
400,10,372,"He would resolve us. At the last, our eyes"
400,10,373,"Enflam’d in him his fellows’ memories,[10]"
400,10,374,And out his grief burst thus: ‘You will’d; we went
400,10,375,Through those thick woods you saw; when a descent
400,10,376,"Show’d us a fair house, in a lightsome ground,"
400,10,377,"Where, at some work, we heard a heav’nly sound"
400,10,378,"Breath’d from a Goddess’, or a woman’s, breast."
400,10,379,"They knock’d, she op’d her bright gates; each her guest"
400,10,380,"Her fair invitement made; nor would they stay,"
400,10,381,"Fools that they were, when she once led the way."
400,10,382,"I enter’d not, suspecting some deceit."
400,10,383,"When all together vanish’d, nor the sight"
400,10,384,Of anyone (though long I look’d) mine eye
400,10,385,"Could any way discover.’ Instantly,"
400,10,386,"My sword and bow reach’d, I bad show the place,"
400,10,387,"When down he fell, did both my knees embrace,"
400,10,388,"And pray’d with tears thus: ‘O thou kept of God,"
400,10,389,"Do not thyself lose, nor to that abode"
400,10,390,"Lead others rashly; both thyself, and all"
400,10,391,"Thou ventur’st thither, I know well, must fall"
400,10,392,In one sure ruin. With these few then fly;
400,10,393,We yet may shun the others’ destiny.’
400,10,394,"I answer’d him: ‘Eurylochus! Stay thou,"
400,10,395,"And keep the ship then, eat and drink; I now"
400,10,396,Will undertake th’ adventure; there is cause
400,10,397,In great Necessity’s unalter’d laws.’
400,10,398,"This said, I left both ship and seas, and on"
400,10,399,Along the sacred valleys all alone
400,10,400,"Went in discov’ry, till at last I came"
400,10,401,Where of the main - med’cine - making Dame
400,10,402,I saw the great house; where encounter’d me
400,10,403,"The golden - rod - sustaining Mercury,"
400,10,404,Ev’n ent’ring Circe’s doors. He met me in
400,10,405,"A young man’s likeness, of the first - flow’r’d chin,"
400,10,406,Whose form hath all the grace of one so young.
400,10,407,"He first call’d to me, then my hand he wrung,"
400,10,408,"And said: ‘Thou no - place - finding - for - repose,"
400,10,409,"Whither, alone, by these hill - confines, goes"
400,10,410,"Thy erring foot? Th’ art ent’ring Circe’s house,"
400,10,411,"Where, by her med’cines, black, and sorcerous,"
400,10,412,"Thy soldiers all are shut in well - arm’d styes,"
400,10,413,And turn’d to swine. Art thou arriv’d with prize
400,10,414,"Fit for their ransoms? Thou com’st out no more,"
400,10,415,"If once thou ent’rest, like thy men before"
400,10,416,"Made to remain here. But I’ll guard thee free,"
400,10,417,And save thee in her spite. Receive of me
400,10,418,"This fair and good receipt; with which once arm’d,"
400,10,419,"Enter her roofs, for th’ art to all proof charm’d"
400,10,420,Against the ill day. I will tell thee all
400,10,421,Her baneful counsel: With a festival
400,10,422,"She’ll first receive thee, but will spice thy bread"
400,10,423,With flow’ry poisons; yet unalteréd
400,10,424,"Shall thy firm form be, for this remedy"
400,10,425,"Stands most approv’d ’gainst all her sorcery,"
400,10,426,Which thus particularly shun: When she
400,10,427,"Shall with her long rod strike thee, instantly"
400,10,428,"Draw from thy thigh thy sword, and fly on her"
400,10,429,"As to her slaughter. She, surpris’d with fear"
400,10,430,"And love, at first, will bid thee to her bed."
400,10,431,"Nor say the Goddess nay, that welcoméd"
400,10,432,"Thou may’st with all respect be, and procure"
400,10,433,"Thy fellows’ freedoms. But before, make sure"
400,10,434,Her favours to thee; and the great oath take
400,10,435,With which the blesséd Gods assurance make
400,10,436,Of all they promise; that no prejudice
400,10,437,"(By stripping thee of form, and faculties)"
400,10,438,She may so much as once attempt on thee.’
400,10,439,"This said, he gave his antidote to me,"
400,10,440,"Which from the earth he pluck’d, and told me all"
400,10,441,"The virtue of it, with what Deities call"
400,10,442,The name it bears; and Moly[11] they impose
400,10,443,For name to it. The root is hard to loose
400,10,444,From hold of earth by mortals; but God’s pow’r
400,10,445,"Can all things do. ’Tis black, but bears a flow’r"
400,10,446,As white as milk. And thus flew Mercury
400,10,447,"Up to immense Olympus, gliding by"
400,10,448,The sylvan island. I made back my way
400,10,449,"To Circe’s house, my mind of my assay"
400,10,450,Much thought revolving. At her gates I stay’d
400,10,451,"And call’d; she heard, and her bright doors display’d,"
400,10,452,"Invited, led; I follow’d in, but trac’d"
400,10,453,With some distraction. In a throne she plac’d
400,10,454,My welcome person; of a curious frame
400,10,455,"’Twas, and so bright I sat as in a flame;"
400,10,456,A foot - stool added. In a golden bowl
400,10,457,"She then suborn’d a potion, in her soul"
400,10,458,Deform’d things thinking; for amidst the wine
400,10,459,She mix’d her man - transforming medicine;
400,10,460,"Which when she saw I had devour’d, she then"
400,10,461,"No more observ’d me with her soothing vein,"
400,10,462,"But struck me with her rod, and to her stye"
400,10,463,"Bad, out, away, and with thy fellows lie."
400,10,464,"I drew my sword, and charg’d her, as I meant"
400,10,465,"To take her life. When out she cried, and bent"
400,10,466,"Beneath my sword her knees, embracing mine,"
400,10,467,"And, full of tears, said: ‘Who? Of what high line"
400,10,468,Art thou the issue? Whence? What shores sustain
400,10,469,Thy native city? I amaz’d remain
400,10,470,"That, drinking these my venoms, th’ art not turn’d."
400,10,471,Never drunk any this cup but be mourn’d
400,10,472,"In other likeness, if it once had pass’d"
400,10,473,The ivory bounders of his tongue and taste.
400,10,474,All but thyself are brutishly declin’d.
400,10,475,"Thy breast holds firm yet, and unchang’d thy mind."
400,10,476,Thou canst be therefore none else but the man
400,10,477,"Of many virtues, Ithacensian,"
400,10,478,"Deep - soul’d, Ulysses, who; I oft was told,"
400,10,479,"By that sly God that bears the rod of gold,"
400,10,480,Was to arrive here in retreat from Troy.
400,10,481,"Sheathe then thy sword, and let my bed enjoy"
400,10,482,"So much a man, that when the bed we prove,"
400,10,483,We may believe in one another’s love.’
400,10,484,"I then: ‘O Circe, why entreat’st thou me"
400,10,485,"To mix in any human league with thee,"
400,10,486,When thou my friends hast beasts turn’d; and thy bed
400,10,487,"Tender’st to me, that I might likewise lead"
400,10,488,"A beast’s life with thee, soften’d, naked stripp’d,"
400,10,489,That in my blood thy banes may more be steep’d?
400,10,490,"I never will ascend thy bed, before,"
400,10,491,"I may affirm, that in heav’n’s sight you swore"
400,10,492,"The great oath of the Gods, that all attempt"
400,10,493,To do me ill is from your thoughts exempt.’
400,10,494,"I said, she swore, when, all the oath - rites said,"
400,10,495,"I then ascended her adornéd bed,"
400,10,496,"But thus prepar’d: Four handmaids served her there,"
400,10,497,"That daughters to her silver fountains were,"
400,10,498,"To her bright - sea - observing sacred floods,"
400,10,499,And to her uncut consecrated woods.
400,10,500,"One deck’d the throne - tops with rich cloths of state,"
400,10,501,And did with silks the foot - pace consecrate.
400,10,502,Another silver tables set before
400,10,503,"The pompous throne, and golden dishes’ store"
400,10,504,Serv’d in with sev’ral feast. A third fill’d wine.
400,10,505,"The fourth brought water, and made fuel shine"
400,10,506,In ruddy fires beneath a womb of brass.
400,10,507,"Which heat, I bath’d; and od’rous water was"
400,10,508,"Disperpled lightly on my head and neck,"
400,10,509,That might my late heart - hurting sorrows check
400,10,510,"With the refreshing sweetness; and, for that,"
400,10,511,Men sometimes may be something delicate.
400,10,512,"Bath’d, and adorn’d, she led me to a throne"
400,10,513,"Of massy silver, and of fashión"
400,10,514,"Exceeding curious. A fair foot - stool set,"
400,10,515,"Water appos’d, and ev’ry sort of meat"
400,10,516,"Set on th’ elaborately - polish’d board,"
400,10,517,She wish’d my taste employ’d; but not a word
400,10,518,Would my ears taste of taste; my mind had food
400,10,519,That must digest; eye - meat would do me good.
400,10,520,Circe (observing that I put no hand
400,10,521,"To any banquet, having countermand"
400,10,522,From weightier cares the light cates could excuse)
400,10,523,"Bowing her near me, these wing’d words did use;"
400,10,524,"‘Why sits Ulysses like one dumb, his mind"
400,10,525,"Less’ning with languors? Nor to food inclin’d,"
400,10,526,Nor wine? Whence comes it? Out of any fear
400,10,527,Of more illusion? You must needs forbear
400,10,528,"That wrongful doubt, since you have heard me swear.’"
400,10,529,"‘O Circe!’ I replied, ‘what man is he,"
400,10,530,"Aw’d with the rights of true humanity,"
400,10,531,"That dares taste food or wine, before he sees"
400,10,532,His friends redeem’d from their deformities?
400,10,533,"If you be gentle, and indeed incline"
400,10,534,"To let me taste the comfort of your wine,"
400,10,535,"Dissolve the charms that their forc’d forms enchain,"
400,10,536,And show me here my honour’d friends like men.’
400,10,537,"This said, she left her throne, and took her rod,"
400,10,538,"Went to her stye, and let my men abroad,"
400,10,539,"Like swine of nine years old. They opposite stood,"
400,10,540,"Observ’d their brutish form, and look’d for food;"
400,10,541,"When, with another med’cine, ev’ry one"
400,10,542,"All over smear’d, their bristles all were gone,"
400,10,543,"Produc’d by malice of the other bane,"
400,10,544,"And ev’ry one, afresh, look’d up a man,"
400,10,545,"Both younger than they were, of stature more,"
400,10,546,And all their forms much goodlier than before.
400,10,547,"All knew me, cling’d about me, and a cry"
400,10,548,Of pleasing mourning flew about so high
400,10,549,The horrid roof resounded; and the queen
400,10,550,"Herself was mov’d to see our kind so keen,"
400,10,551,"Who bad me now bring ship and men ashore,"
400,10,552,"Our arms, and goods in caves hid, and restore"
400,10,553,"Myself to her, with all my other men."
400,10,554,"I granted, went, and op’d the weeping vein"
400,10,555,In all my men; whose violent joy to see
400,10,556,My safe return was passing kindly free
400,10,557,"Of friendly tears, and miserably wept."
400,10,558,"You have not seen young heifers (highly kept,"
400,10,559,"Fill’d full of daisies at the field, and driv’n"
400,10,560,"Home to their hovels, all so spritely giv’n"
400,10,561,"That no room can contain them, but about"
400,10,562,"Bace by the dams, and let their spirits out"
400,10,563,In ceaseless bleating) of more jocund plight
400,10,564,"Than my kind friends, ev’n crying out with sight"
400,10,565,Of my return so doubted; circled me
400,10,566,"With all their welcomes, and as cheerfully"
400,10,567,"Dispos’d their rapt minds, as if there they saw"
400,10,568,"Their natural country, cliffy Ithaca,"
400,10,569,"And ev’n the roofs where they were bred and born,"
400,10,570,"And vow’d as much, with tears; ‘O your return"
400,10,571,As much delights us as in you had come
400,10,572,"Our country to us, and our natural home."
400,10,573,But what unhappy fate hath reft our friends?’
400,10,574,"I gave unlook’d - for answer, that amends"
400,10,575,"Made for their mourning, bad them first of all"
400,10,576,"Our ship ashore draw, then in caverns stall"
400,10,577,"Our foody cattle, hide our mutual prize,"
400,10,578,"῾And then,᾿ said I, ῾attend me, that your eyes,"
400,10,579,"In Circe’s sacred house, may see each friend"
400,10,580,Eating and drinking banquets out of end.᾿
400,10,581,"They soon obey’d; all but Eurylochus,"
400,10,582,"Who needs would stay them all, and counsell’d thus:"
400,10,583,῾O wretches! whither will ye? Why are you
400,10,584,"Fond of your mischiefs, and such gladness show"
400,10,585,"For Circe’s house, that will transform ye all"
400,10,586,"To swine, or wolves, or lions? Never shall"
400,10,587,"Our heads get out, if once within we be,"
400,10,588,But stay compell’d by strong necessity.
400,10,589,"So wrought the Cyclop, when t’ his cave our friends"
400,10,590,"This bold one led on, and brought all their ends"
400,10,591,By his one indiscretion.᾿ I for this
400,10,592,Thought with my sword (that desp’rate head of his
400,10,593,Hewn from his neck) to gash upon the ground
400,10,594,"His mangled body, though my blood was bound"
400,10,595,In near alliance to him. But the rest
400,10,596,"With humble suit contain’d me, and request,"
400,10,597,"That I would leave him with my ship alone,"
400,10,598,And to the sacred palace lead them on.
400,10,599,I led them; nor Eurylochus would stay
400,10,600,"From their attendance on me, our late fray"
400,10,601,"Struck to his heart so. But mean time, my men,"
400,10,602,"In Circe’s house, were all, in sev’ral bain,"
400,10,603,"Studiously sweeten’d, smug’d with oil, and deck’d"
400,10,604,"With in and out weeds, and a feast secret"
400,10,605,Serv’d in before them; at which close we found
400,10,606,"They all were set, cheer’d, and carousing round,"
400,10,607,"When mutual sight had, and all thought on, then"
400,10,608,"Feast was forgotten, and the moan again[12]"
400,10,609,"About the house flew, driv’n with wings of joy."
400,10,610,"But then spake Circe: ‘Now, no more annoy,"
400,10,611,"I know myself what woes by sea, and shore,"
400,10,612,And men unjust have plagued enough before
400,10,613,"Your injur’d virtues. Here then feast as long,"
400,10,614,"And be as cheerful, till ye grow as strong"
400,10,615,As when ye first forsook your country - earth.
400,10,616,"Ye now fare all like exiles; not a mirth,"
400,10,617,"Flash’d in amongst ye, but is quench’d again"
400,10,618,"With still - renew’d tears, though the beaten vein"
400,10,619,"Of your distresses should, me think, be now"
400,10,620,Benumb with suff’rance.’ We did well allow
400,10,621,"Her kind persuasions, and the whole year stay’d"
400,10,622,"In varied feast with her. When, now array’d"
400,10,623,"The world was with the spring, and orby hours"
400,10,624,"Had gone the round again through herbs and flow’rs,"
400,10,625,"The months absolv’d in order, till the days"
400,10,626,Had run their full race in Apollo’s rays;
400,10,627,"My friends remember’d me of home, and said;"
400,10,628,"If ever fate would sign my pass, delay’d"
400,10,629,"It should be now no more. I heard them well,"
400,10,630,"Yet that day spent in feast, till darkness fell,"
400,10,631,And sleep his virtues through our vapours shed.
400,10,632,"When I ascended sacred Circe’s bed,"
400,10,633,"Implor’d my pass, and her performéd vow"
400,10,634,"Which now my soul urg’d, and my soldiers now"
400,10,635,Afflicted me with tears to get them gone.
400,10,636,"All these I told her, and she answer’d these:"
400,10,637,“Much - skill’d Ulysses Laertiades!
400,10,638,"Remain no more against your wills with me,"
400,10,639,But take your free way; only this must be
400,10,640,Perform’d before you steer your course for home:
400,10,641,"You must the way to Pluto overcome,"
400,10,642,"And stern Persephoné, to form your pass,"
400,10,643,"By th’ aged Theban soul Tiresias,"
400,10,644,"The dark - brow’d prophet, whose soul yet can see"
400,10,645,"Clearly, and firmly; grave Persephoné,"
400,10,646,"Ev’n dead, gave him a mind, that he alone"
400,10,647,"Might sing truth’s solid wisdom, and not one"
400,10,648,Prove more than shade in his comparison.᾿
400,10,649,"This broke my heart; I sunk into my bed,"
400,10,650,"Mourn’d, and would never more be comforted"
400,10,651,"With light, nor life. But having now exprest"
400,10,652,"My pains enough to her in my unrest,"
400,10,653,"That so I might prepare her ruth, and get"
400,10,654,"All I held fit for an affair so great,"
400,10,655,"I said: ‘O Circe, who shall steer my course"
400,10,656,To Pluto’s kingdom? Never ship had force
400,10,657,To make that voyage.’ The divine - in - voice
400,10,658,"Said; ‘Seek no guide, raise you your mast, and hoise"
400,10,659,"Your ship’s white sails, and then sit yon at peace,"
400,10,660,The fresh North Spirit shall waft ye through the Seas.
400,10,661,"But, having past the ocean, you shall see"
400,10,662,"A little shore, that to Persephoné"
400,10,663,"Puts up a consecrated wood, where grows"
400,10,664,"Tall firs, and sallows that their fruits soon lose."
400,10,665,"Cast anchor in the gulfs, and go alone"
400,10,666,"To Pluto’s dark house, where, to Acheron"
400,10,667,"Cocytus runs, and Pyriphlegethon,"
400,10,668,"Cocytus born of Styx, and where a rock"
400,10,669,Of both the met floods bears the roaring shock.
400,10,670,"The dark heroë, great Tiresias,"
400,10,671,"Now coming near, to gain propitious pass,"
400,10,672,"Dig of a cubit ev’ry way a pit,"
400,10,673,And pour to all that are deceas’d in it
400,10,674,"A solemn sacrifice. For which, first take"
400,10,675,"Honey and wine, and their commixtion make;"
400,10,676,Then sweet wine neat; and thirdly water pour;
400,10,677,And lastly add to these the whitest flour.
400,10,678,Then vow to all the weak necks of the dead
400,10,679,"Off’rings a number; and, when thou shalt tread"
400,10,680,"The Ithacensian shore, to sacrifice"
400,10,681,"A heifer never - tam’d, and most of prize,"
400,10,682,A pile of all thy most esteeméd goods
400,10,683,Enflaming to the dear streams of their bloods;
400,10,684,"And, in secret rites, to Tiresias vow"
400,10,685,"A ram coal - black at all parts, that doth flow"
400,10,686,"With fat and fleece, and all thy flocks doth lead."
400,10,687,When the all - calling nation of the dead[13]
400,10,688,"Thou thus hast pray’d to, offer on the place"
400,10,689,A ram and ewe all black being turn’d in face
400,10,690,"To dreadful Erebus, thyself aside"
400,10,691,"The flood’s shore walking. And then, gratified"
400,10,692,With flocks of souls of men and dames deceas’d
400,10,693,Shall all thy pious rites be. Straight address’d
400,10,694,"See then the off’ring that thy fellows slew,"
400,10,695,"Flay’d, and impos’d in fire; and all thy crew"
400,10,696,"Pray to the state of either Deity,"
400,10,697,"Grave Pluto, and severe Persephoné."
400,10,698,"Then draw thy sword, stand firm, nor suffer one"
400,10,699,Of all the faint shades of the dead and gone
400,10,700,"T’ approach the blood, till thou hast heard their king,"
400,10,701,The wise Tiresias; who thy offering
400,10,702,"Will instantly do honour, thy home - ways,"
400,10,703,"And all the measure of them by the seas,"
400,10,704,Amply unfolding.’ This the Goddess told;
400,10,705,And then the Morning in her throne of gold
400,10,706,Survey’d the vast world; by whose orient light
400,10,707,"The Nymph adorn’d me with attires as bright,"
400,10,708,"Her own hands putting on both shirt and weed,"
400,10,709,"Robes fine, and curious, and upon my head"
400,10,710,"An ornament that glitter’d like a flame,"
400,10,711,Girt me in gold; and forth betimes I came
400,10,712,"Amongst my soldiers, rous’d them all from sleep,"
400,10,713,And bad them now no more observance keep
400,10,714,"Of ease, and feast, but straight a - shipboard fall,"
400,10,715,For now the Goddess had inform’d me all.
400,10,716,Their noble spirits agreed; nor yet so clear
400,10,717,"Could I bring all off, but Elpenor there"
400,10,718,His heedless life left. He was youngest man
400,10,719,"Of all my company, and one that wan"
400,10,720,"Least fame for arms, as little for his brain;"
400,10,721,"Who (too much steep’d in wine, and so made fain"
400,10,722,"To get refreshing by the cool of sleep,"
400,10,723,"Apart his fellows, plung’d in vapours deep,"
400,10,724,And they as high in tumult of their way)
400,10,725,Suddenly wak’d and (quite out of the stay
400,10,726,A sober mind had giv’n him) would descend
400,10,727,"A huge long ladder, forward, and an end"
400,10,728,"Fell from the very roof, full pitching on"
400,10,729,"The dearest joint his head was plac’d upon,"
400,10,730,"Which, quite dissolv’d, let loose his soul to hell."
400,10,731,"I to the rest, and Circe’s means did tell"
400,10,732,"Of our return, as crossing clean the hope"
400,10,733,"I gave them first, and said: ‘You think the scope"
400,10,734,Of our endeavours now is straight for home;
400,10,735,"No; Circe otherwise design’d, whose doom"
400,10,736,Enjoin’d us first to greet the dreadful house
400,10,737,"Of austere Pluto and his glorious spouse,"
400,10,738,"To take the counsel of Tiresias,"
400,10,739,"The rev’rend Theban, to direct our pass.’"
400,10,740,"This brake their hearts, and grief made tear their hair."
400,10,741,But grief was never good at great affair;
400,10,742,It would have way yet. We went woful on
400,10,743,"To ship and shore, where was arriv’d as soon"
400,10,744,"Circe unseen, a black ewe and a ram"
400,10,745,"Binding for sacrifice, and, as she came,"
400,10,746,Vanish’d again unwitness’d by our eyes;
400,10,747,"Which griev’d not us, nor check’d our sacrifice,"
400,10,748,"For who would see God, loth to let us see,"
400,10,749,This way or that bent; still his ways are free.

400,11,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,11,2,Ulysees’ way to Hell appears;
400,11,3,Where he the grave Tiresias hears;
400,11,4,Enquires his own and others’ fates;
400,11,5,"His mother sees, and th’ after states"
400,11,6,In which were held by sad decease
400,11,7,"Heroës, and Heroesses,"
400,11,8,"A number, that at Troy wag’d war;"
400,11,9,As Ajax that was still at jar
400,11,10,"With Ithacus, for th’ arms he lost;"
400,11,11,And with the great Achilles’ ghost.
400,11,12,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,11,13,_Λάνβδα._
400,11,14,Ulysses here
400,11,15,"Invokes the dead,"
400,11,16,The lives appear
400,11,17,Hereafter led.
400,11,18,"“Arriv’d now at our ship, we launch’d, and set"
400,11,19,"Our mast up, put forth sail, and in did get"
400,11,20,"Our late - got cattle. Up our sails, we went,"
400,11,21,My wayward fellows mourning now th’ event.[1]
400,11,22,"A good companion yet, a foreright wind,"
400,11,23,Circe (the excellent utt’rer of her mind)
400,11,24,"Supplied our murmuring consorts with, that was"
400,11,25,Both speed and guide to our adventurous pass.
400,11,26,"All day our sails stood to the winds, and made"
400,11,27,"Our voyage prosp’rous. Sun then set, and shade"
400,11,28,"All ways obscuring, on the bounds we fell"
400,11,29,"Of deep Oceanus, where people dwell"
400,11,30,"Whom a perpetual cloud obscures outright,"
400,11,31,"To whom the cheerful sun lends never light,"
400,11,32,"Nor when he mounts the star - sustaining heaven,"
400,11,33,"Nor when he stoops earth, and sets up the even,"
400,11,34,"But night holds fix’d wings, feather’d all with banes,"
400,11,35,Above those most unblest Cimmerians.
400,11,36,"Here drew we up our ship, our sheep withdrew,"
400,11,37,"And walk’d the shore till we attain’d the view,"
400,11,38,Of that sad region Circe had foreshow’d;
400,11,39,And then the sacred off’rings to be vow’d
400,11,40,Eurylochus and Persimedes bore.
400,11,41,"When I my sword drew, and earth’s womb did gore"
400,11,42,"Till I a pit digg’d of a cubit round,"
400,11,43,"Which with the liquid sacrifice we crown’d,"
400,11,44,"First honey mix’d with wine, then sweet wine neat,"
400,11,45,"Then water pour’d in, last the flour of wheat."
400,11,46,"Much I importun’d then the weak - neck’d dead,"
400,11,47,"And vow’d, when I the barren soil should tread"
400,11,48,"Of clifty Ithaca, amidst my hall"
400,11,49,"To kill a heifer, my clear best of all,"
400,11,50,"And give in off’ring, on a pile compos’d"
400,11,51,Of all the choice goods my whole house enclos’d.
400,11,52,"And to Tiresias himself, alone,"
400,11,53,"A sheep coal - black, and the selectest one"
400,11,54,"Of all my flocks. When to the Pow’rs beneath,"
400,11,55,"The sacred nation that survive with death,"
400,11,56,"My pray’rs and vows had done devotions fit,"
400,11,57,"I took the off’rings, and upon the pit"
400,11,58,"Bereft their lives. Out gush’d the sable blood,"
400,11,59,And round about me fled out of the flood
400,11,60,The souls of the deceas’d. There cluster’d then
400,11,61,"Youths, and their wives, much - suff’ring aged men,"
400,11,62,Soft tender virgins that but new came there
400,11,63,"By timeless death, and green their sorrows were."
400,11,64,"There men - at - arms, with armours all embrew’d,"
400,11,65,"Wounded with lances, and with faulchions hew’d,"
400,11,66,"In numbers, up and down the ditch, did stalk,"
400,11,67,"And threw unmeasur’d cries about their walk,"
400,11,68,So horrid that a bloodless fear surpris’d
400,11,69,My daunted spirits. Straight then I advis’d
400,11,70,"My friends to flay the slaughter’d sacrifice,"
400,11,71,"Put them in fire, and to the Deities,"
400,11,72,"Stern Pluto and Persephoné, apply"
400,11,73,Exciteful pray’rs. Then drew I from my thigh
400,11,74,"My well - edg’d sword, stept in, and firmly stood"
400,11,75,"Betwixt the prease of shadows and the blood,"
400,11,76,And would not suffer anyone to dip
400,11,77,"Within our off’ring his unsolid lip,"
400,11,78,Before Tiresias that did all controul.
400,11,79,"The first that press’d in was Elpenor’s soul,"
400,11,80,His body in the broad - way’d earth as yet
400,11,81,"Unmourn’d, unburied by us, since we swet"
400,11,82,With other urgent labours. Yet his smart
400,11,83,"I wept to see, and rued it from my heart,"
400,11,84,Enquiring how he could before me be
400,11,85,"That came by ship? He, mourning, answer’d me:"
400,11,86,"‘In Circe’s house, the spite some spirit did bear,"
400,11,87,"And the unspeakable good liquor there,"
400,11,88,"Hath been my bane; for, being to descend"
400,11,89,"A ladder much in height, I did not tend"
400,11,90,"My way well down, but forwards made a proof"
400,11,91,"To tread the rounds, and from the very roof"
400,11,92,"Fell on my neck, and brake it; and this made"
400,11,93,My soul thus visit this infernal shade.
400,11,94,"And here, by them that next thyself are dear,"
400,11,95,"Thy wife, and father, that a little one"
400,11,96,"Gave food to thee, and by thy only son"
400,11,97,"At home behind thee left, Telemachus,"
400,11,98,"Do not depart by stealth, and leave me thus,"
400,11,99,"Unmourn’d, unburied, lest neglected I"
400,11,100,Bring on thyself th’ incenséd Deity.
400,11,101,"I know that, sail’d from hence, thy ship must touch"
400,11,102,"On th’ isle Ææa; where vouchsafe thus much,"
400,11,103,"Good king, that, landed, thou wilt instantly"
400,11,104,Bestow on me thy royal memory
400,11,105,"To this grace, that my body, arms and all,"
400,11,106,May rest consum’d in fiery funeral;
400,11,107,And on the foamy shore a sepulchre
400,11,108,"Erect to me, that after - times may hear"
400,11,109,Of one so hapless. Let me these implore
400,11,110,And fix upon my sepulchre the oar[2]
400,11,111,"With which alive I shook the aged seas,"
400,11,112,And had of friends the dear societies.’
400,11,113,I told the wretched soul I would fulfill
400,11,114,And execute to th’ utmost point his will;
400,11,115,"And, all the time we sadly talk’d, I still"
400,11,116,"My sword above the blood held, when aside"
400,11,117,The idol of my friend still amplified
400,11,118,"His plaint, as up and down the shades he err’d."
400,11,119,"Then my deceaséd mother’s soul appear’d,"
400,11,120,"Fair daughter of Autolycus the great,"
400,11,121,"Grave Anticlea, whom, when forth I set"
400,11,122,"For sacred Ilion, I had left alive."
400,11,123,"Her sight much mov’d me, and to tears did drive"
400,11,124,My note of her decease; and yet not she
400,11,125,(Though in my ruth she held the high’st degree)
400,11,126,"Would I admit to touch the sacred blood,"
400,11,127,Till from Tiresias I had understood
400,11,128,What Circe told me. At the length did land
400,11,129,"Theban Tiresias’ soul, and in his hand"
400,11,130,"Sustain’d a golden sceptre, knew me well,"
400,11,131,"And said: ‘O man unhappy, why to hell"
400,11,132,"Admitt’st thou dark arrival, and the light"
400,11,133,"The sun gives leav’st, to have the horrid sight"
400,11,134,"Of this black region, and the shadows here?"
400,11,135,"Now sheathe thy sharp sword, and the pit forbear,"
400,11,136,"That I the blood may taste, and then relate"
400,11,137,The truth of those acts that affect thy fate.’
400,11,138,"I sheath’d my sword, and left the pit, till he,"
400,11,139,"The black blood tasting, thus instructed me:"
400,11,140,‘Renown’d Ulysses! All unask’d I know
400,11,141,That all the cause of thy arrival now
400,11,142,Is to enquire thy wish’d retreat for home;
400,11,143,"Which hardly God will let thee overcome,"
400,11,144,"Since Neptune still will his opposure try,"
400,11,145,"With all his laid - up anger, for the eye"
400,11,146,His lov’d son lost to thee. And yet through all
400,11,147,Thy suff’ring course (which must be capital)
400,11,148,"If both thine own affections, and thy friends,"
400,11,149,"Thou wilt contain, when thy access ascends"
400,11,150,"The three - fork’d island, having ‘scap’d the seas,"
400,11,151,Where ye shall find fed on the flow’ry leas
400,11,152,"Fat flocks, and oxen, which the Sun doth own,"
400,11,153,"To whom are all things as well heard as shown,"
400,11,154,"And never dare one head of those to slay,"
400,11,155,"But hold unharmful on your wishéd way,"
400,11,156,"Though through enough affliction, yet secure"
400,11,157,"Your Fates shall land ye; but presage says sure,"
400,11,158,"If once ye spoil them, spoil to all thy friends,"
400,11,159,"Spoil to thy fleet, and if the justice ends"
400,11,160,"Short of thyself, it shall be long before,"
400,11,161,"And that length forc’d out with inflictions store,"
400,11,162,"When, losing all thy fellows, in a sail"
400,11,163,Of foreign built (when most thy Fates prevail
400,11,164,In thy deliv’rance) thus th’ event shall sort:
400,11,165,"Thou shalt find shipwrack raging in thy port,"
400,11,166,"Proud men thy goods consuming, and thy wife"
400,11,167,"Urging with gifts, give charge upon thy life."
400,11,168,"But all these wrongs revenge shall end to thee,"
400,11,169,"And force, or cunning, set with slaughter free"
400,11,170,The house of all thy spoilers. Yet again
400,11,171,"Thou shalt a voyage make, and come to men"
400,11,172,"That know no sea, nor ships, nor oars that are"
400,11,173,"Wings to a ship, nor mix with any fare[3]"
400,11,174,"Salt’s savoury vapour. Where thou first shalt land,"
400,11,175,"This clear - giv’n sign shall let thee understand,"
400,11,176,That there those men remain: Assume ashore
400,11,177,"Up to thy royal shoulder a ship oar,"
400,11,178,"With which, when thou shalt meet one on the way"
400,11,179,That will in county admiration say
400,11,180,What dost thou with that wan upon thy neck?
400,11,181,"There fix that wan thy oar, and that shore deck"
400,11,182,With sacred rites to Neptune; slaughter there
400,11,183,"A ram, a bull, and (who for strength doth bear"
400,11,184,The name of husband to a herd) a boar.
400,11,185,"And, coming home, upon thy natural shore,"
400,11,186,"Give pious hecatombs to all the Gods,"
400,11,187,Degrees observ’d. And then the periods
400,11,188,Of all thy labours in the peace shall end
400,11,189,Of easy death; which shall the less extend
400,11,190,"His passion to thee, that thy foe, the Sea,"
400,11,191,"Shall not enforce it, but Death’s victory"
400,11,192,"Shall chance in only - earnest - pray - vow’d age,[4]"
400,11,193,"Obtain’d at home, quite emptied of his rage,"
400,11,194,"Thy subjects round about thee, rich and blest."
400,11,195,And here hath Truth summ’d up thy vital rest.’
400,11,196,I answer’d him: ‘We will suppose all these
400,11,197,Decreed in Deity; let it likewise please
400,11,198,"Tiresias to resolve me, why so near"
400,11,199,"The blood and me my mother’s soul doth bear,"
400,11,200,"And yet nor word, nor look, vouchsafe her son?"
400,11,201,"Doth she not know me?’ ‘No,’ said he, ‘nor none"
400,11,202,"Of all these spirits, but myself alone,"
400,11,203,Knows anything till he shall taste the blood.
400,11,204,"But whomsoever you shall do that good,"
400,11,205,He will the truth of all you wish unfold;
400,11,206,Who you envy it to will all withhold.’
400,11,207,"Thus said the kingly soul, and made retreat"
400,11,208,"Amidst the inner parts of Pluto’s seat,"
400,11,209,When he had spoke thus by divine instinct.
400,11,210,"Still I stood firm, till to the blood’s precinct"
400,11,211,"My mother came, and drunk; and then she knew"
400,11,212,"I was her son, had passion to renew"
400,11,213,"Her natural plaints, which thus she did pursue:"
400,11,214,"‘How is it, O my son, that you alive"
400,11,215,This deadly - darksome region underdive?
400,11,216,"’Twixt which, and earth, so many mighty seas,"
400,11,217,"And horrid currents, interpose their prease,"
400,11,218,Oceanus in chief? Which none (unless
400,11,219,More help’d than you) on foot now can transgress.
400,11,220,A well - built ship he needs that ventures there.
400,11,221,"Com’st thou from Troy but now, enforc’d to err"
400,11,222,"All this time with thy soldiers? Nor hast seen,"
400,11,223,"Ere this long day, thy country, and thy queen?’"
400,11,224,I answer’d: ‘That a necessary end
400,11,225,To this infernal state made me contend;
400,11,226,That from the wise Tiresias’ Theban soul
400,11,227,I might an oracle involv’d unroll;
400,11,228,"For I came nothing near Achaia yet,"
400,11,229,"Nor on our lov’d earth happy foot had set,"
400,11,230,"But, mishaps suff’ring, err’d from coast to coast,"
400,11,231,Ever since first the mighty Grecian host
400,11,232,"Divine Atrides led to Ilion,"
400,11,233,"And I his follower, to set war upon"
400,11,234,The rapeful Trojans; and so pray’d she would
400,11,235,"The fate of that ungentle death unfold,"
400,11,236,"That forc’d her thither; if some long disease,"
400,11,237,"Or that the spleen of her - that - arrows - please,"
400,11,238,"Diana, envious of most eminent dames,"
400,11,239,Had made her th’ object of her deadly aims?
400,11,240,"My father’s state and sons I sought, if they"
400,11,241,Kept still my goods? Or they became the prey
400,11,242,"Of any other, holding me no more"
400,11,243,In pow’r of safe return? Or if my store
400,11,244,My wife had kept together with her son?
400,11,245,"If she her first mind held, or had been won"
400,11,246,By some chief Grecian from my love and bed?’
400,11,247,All this she answer’d: ‘That affliction fed
400,11,248,"On her blood still at home, and that to grief"
400,11,249,She all the days and darkness of her life
400,11,250,In tears had consecrate. That none possest
400,11,251,"My famous kingdom’s throne, but th’ interest"
400,11,252,"My son had in it still he held in peace,"
400,11,253,"A court kept like a prince, and his increase"
400,11,254,"Spent in his subjects’ good, administ’ring laws"
400,11,255,"With justice, and the general applause"
400,11,256,"A king should merit, and all call’d him king."
400,11,257,"My father kept the upland, labouring,"
400,11,258,"And shunn’d the city, us’d no sumptuous beds,"
400,11,259,"Wonder’d - at furnitures, nor wealthy weeds,"
400,11,260,But in the winter strew’d about the fire
400,11,261,"Lay with his slaves in ashes, his attire"
400,11,262,"Like to a beggar’s; when the summer came,"
400,11,263,"And autumn all fruits ripen’d with his flame,"
400,11,264,"Where grape - charg’d vines made shadows most abound,"
400,11,265,"His couch with fall’n leaves made upon the ground,"
400,11,266,"And here lay he, his sorrow’s fruitful state"
400,11,267,Increasing as he faded for my fate;
400,11,268,And now the part of age that irksome is
400,11,269,Lay sadly on him. And that life of his
400,11,270,"She led, and perish’d in; not slaughter’d by"
400,11,271,"The Dame that darts lov’d, and her archery;"
400,11,272,"Nor by disease invaded, vast and foul,"
400,11,273,"That wastes the body, and sends out the soul"
400,11,274,"With shame and horror; only in her moan,"
400,11,275,"For me and my life, she consum’d her own.’"
400,11,276,"She thus, when I had great desire to prove"
400,11,277,My arms the circle where her soul did move.
400,11,278,"Thrice prov’d I, thrice she vanish’d like a sleep,"
400,11,279,"Or fleeting shadow, which struck much more deep"
400,11,280,"The wounds my woes made, and made ask her why"
400,11,281,"She would my love to her embraces fly,"
400,11,282,And not vouchsafe that ev’n in hell we might
400,11,283,"Pay pious Nature her unalter’d right,"
400,11,284,And give Vexation here her cruel fill?
400,11,285,"Should not the Queen here, to augment the ill"
400,11,286,"Of ev’ry suff’rance, which her office is,"
400,11,287,Enforce thy idol to afford me this?
400,11,288,"‘O son,’ she answer’d, ‘of the race of men"
400,11,289,"The most unhappy, our most equal Queen"
400,11,290,"Will mock no solid arms with empty shade,"
400,11,291,Nor suffer empty shades again t’ invade
400,11,292,"Flesh, bones, and nerves; nor will defraud the fire"
400,11,293,"Of his last dues, that, soon as spirits expire"
400,11,294,"And leave the white bone, are his native right,"
400,11,295,"When, like a dream, the soul assumes her flight."
400,11,296,"The light then of the living with most haste,"
400,11,297,"O son, contend to. This thy little taste"
400,11,298,Of this state is enough; and all this life
400,11,299,Will make a tale fit to be told thy wife.’
400,11,300,This speech we had; when now repair’d to me
400,11,301,"More female spirits, by Persephoné"
400,11,302,"Driv’n on before her. All th’ heroës’ wives,"
400,11,303,"And daughters, that led there their second lives,"
400,11,304,About the black blood throng’d. Of whom yet more
400,11,305,"My mind impell’d me to inquire, before"
400,11,306,"I let them all together taste the gore,"
400,11,307,"For then would all have been dispers’d, and gone"
400,11,308,"Thick as they came. I, therefore, one by one"
400,11,309,"Let taste the pit, my sword drawn from my thigh,"
400,11,310,"And stand betwixt them made, when, sev’rally,"
400,11,311,"All told their stocks. The first, that quench’d her fire,"
400,11,312,"Was Tyro, issued of a noble sire."
400,11,313,"She said she sprung from pure Salmoneus’ bed,"
400,11,314,"And Cretheus, son of Æolus, did wed;"
400,11,315,"Yet the divine flood Enipëus lov’d,"
400,11,316,Who much the most fair stream of all floods mov’d.
400,11,317,"Near whose streams Tyro walking, Neptune came,"
400,11,318,"Like Enipëus, and enjoy’d the dame."
400,11,319,"Like to a hill, the blue and snaky flood"
400,11,320,"Above th’ immortal and the mortal stood,"
400,11,321,"And hid them both, as both together lay,"
400,11,322,Just where his current falls into the sea.
400,11,323,"Her virgin waist dissolv’d, she slumber’d then;"
400,11,324,"But when the God had done the work of men,"
400,11,325,"Her fair hand gently wringing, thus he said:"
400,11,326,"‘Woman! rejoice in our combinéd bed,"
400,11,327,For when the year hath run his circle round
400,11,328,(Because the Gods’ loves must in fruit abound)
400,11,329,"My love shall make, to cheer thy teeming moans,"
400,11,330,Thy one dear burden bear two famous sons;
400,11,331,"Love well, and bring them up. Go home, and see"
400,11,332,"That, though of more joy yet I shall be free,"
400,11,333,"Thou dost not tell, to glorify thy birth;"
400,11,334,"Thy love is Neptune, shaker of the earth.’"
400,11,335,"This said, he plung’d into the sea; and she,"
400,11,336,"Begot with child by him, the light let see"
400,11,337,"Great Pelias, and Neleus, that became"
400,11,338,In Jove’s great ministry of mighty fame.
400,11,339,"Pelias in broad Iolcus held his throne,"
400,11,340,Wealthy in cattle; th’ other royal son
400,11,341,Rul’d sandy Pylos. To these issue more
400,11,342,"This queen of women to her husband bore,"
400,11,343,"Æson, and Pheres, and Amythaon"
400,11,344,That for his fight on horseback stoop’d to none.
400,11,345,"Next her, I saw admir’d Antiope,"
400,11,346,"Asopus’ daughter, who (as much as she"
400,11,347,Boasted attraction of great Neptune’s love)
400,11,348,"Boasted to slumber in the arms of Jove,"
400,11,349,And two sons likewise at one burden bore
400,11,350,"To that her all - controlling paramour,"
400,11,351,"Amphion, and fair Zethus; that first laid"
400,11,352,"Great Thebes’ foundations, and strong walls convey’d"
400,11,353,"About her turrets, that seven ports enclos’d,"
400,11,354,"For though the Thebans much in strength repos’d,"
400,11,355,"Yet had not they the strength to hold their own,"
400,11,356,Without the added aids of wood and stone.
400,11,357,"Alcmena next I saw, that famous wife"
400,11,358,"Was to Amphitryo, and honour’d life"
400,11,359,"Gave to the lion - hearted Hercules,"
400,11,360,That was of Jove’s embrace the great increase.
400,11,361,"I saw, besides, proud Creon’s daughter there,"
400,11,362,"Bright Megara, that nuptial yoke did wear"
400,11,363,"With Jove’s great son, who never field did try"
400,11,364,But bore to him the flow’r of victory.
400,11,365,"The mother then of Œdipus I saw,"
400,11,366,"Fair Epicasta, that, beyond all law,"
400,11,367,"Her own son married, ignorant of kind."
400,11,368,"And he, as darkly taken in his mind,"
400,11,369,"His mother wedded, and his father slew."
400,11,370,"Whose blind act Heav’n expos’d at length to view,"
400,11,371,And he in all - lov’d Thebes the supreme state
400,11,372,"With much moan manag’d, for the heavy fate"
400,11,373,The Gods laid on him. She made violent flight
400,11,374,"To Pluto’s dark house from the loathéd light,"
400,11,375,"Beneath a steep beam strangled with a cord,"
400,11,376,"And left her son, in life, pains as abhorr’d"
400,11,377,As all the Furies pour’d on her in hell.
400,11,378,"Then saw I Chloris, that did so excell"
400,11,379,"In answering beauties, that each part had all."
400,11,380,"Great Neleus married her, when gifts not small"
400,11,381,"Had won her favour, term’d by name of dow’r."
400,11,382,She was of all Amphion’s seed the flow’r;
400,11,383,"Amphion, call’d Iasides, that then"
400,11,384,"Rul’d strongly Myniæan Orchomen,"
400,11,385,"And now his daughter rul’d the Pylian throne,"
400,11,386,Because her beauty’s empire overshone.
400,11,387,"She brought her wife - awed husband, Neleús,"
400,11,388,"Nestor much honour’d, Periclymenus,"
400,11,389,"And Chromius, sons with sov’reign virtues grac’d;"
400,11,390,"But after brought a daughter that surpass’d,"
400,11,391,"Rare - beautied Pero, so for form exact"
400,11,392,That Nature to a miracle was rack’d
400,11,393,"In her perfections, blaz’d with th’ eyes of men;"
400,11,394,"That made of all the country’s hearts a chain,"
400,11,395,And drew them suitors to her. Which her sire
400,11,396,"Took vantage of, and, since he did aspire"
400,11,397,To nothing more than to the broad - brow’d herd
400,11,398,"Of oxen, which the common fame so rear’d,"
400,11,399,"Own’d by Iphiclus, not a man should be"
400,11,400,"His Pero’s husband, that from Phylace"
400,11,401,Those never - yet - driv’n oxen could not drive.
400,11,402,"Yet these a strong hope held him to achieve,"
400,11,403,"Because a prophet, that had never err’d,"
400,11,404,"Had said, that only he should be preferr’d"
400,11,405,To their possession. But the equal fate
400,11,406,Of God withstood his stealth; inextricate
400,11,407,"Imprisoning bands, and sturdy churlish swains"
400,11,408,"That were the herdsmen, who withheld with chains"
400,11,409,The stealth - attempter; which was only he
400,11,410,"That durst abet the act with prophecy,"
400,11,411,"None else would undertake it, and he must;"
400,11,412,The king would needs a prophet should be just.
400,11,413,"But when some days and months expired were,"
400,11,414,"And all the hours had brought about the year,"
400,11,415,The prophet did so satisfy the king
400,11,416,"(Iphiclus, all his cunning questioning)"
400,11,417,"That he enfranchis’d him; and, all worst done,"
400,11,418,Jove’s counsel made th’ all - safe conclusión.
400,11,419,"Then saw I Leda, link’d in nuptial chain"
400,11,420,"With Tyndarus, to whom she did sustain"
400,11,421,"Sons much renown’d for wisdom; Castor one,"
400,11,422,That pass’d for use of horse comparison;
400,11,423,"And Pollux, that excell’d in whirlbat fight;"
400,11,424,"Both these the fruitful earth bore, while the light"
400,11,425,"Of life inspir’d them; after which, they found"
400,11,426,"Such grace with Jove, that both liv’d under ground,"
400,11,427,"By change of days; life still did one sustain,"
400,11,428,"While th’ other died; the dead then liv’d again,"
400,11,429,The living dying; both of one self date
400,11,430,Their lives and deaths made by the Gods and Fate.
400,11,431,"Iphimedia after Leda came,"
400,11,432,That did derive from Neptune too the name
400,11,433,Of father to two admirable sons.
400,11,434,"Life yet made short their admiratións,"
400,11,435,"Who God - opposéd Otus had to name,"
400,11,436,And Ephialtes far in sound of fame.
400,11,437,"The prodigal earth so fed them, that they grew"
400,11,438,"To most huge stature, and had fairest hue"
400,11,439,"Of all men, but Orion, under heav’n."
400,11,440,At nine years old nine cubits they were driv’n
400,11,441,"Abroad in breadth, and sprung nine fathoms high."
400,11,442,"They threaten’d to give battle to the sky,"
400,11,443,And all th’ Immortals. They were setting on
400,11,444,"Ossa upon Olympus, and upon"
400,11,445,"Steep Ossa leavy Pelius, that ev’n"
400,11,446,They might a highway make with lofty heav’n;
400,11,447,"And had perhaps perform’d it, had they liv’d"
400,11,448,Till they were striplings; but Jove’s son depriv’d
400,11,449,"Their limbs of life, before th’ age that begins"
400,11,450,"The flow’r of youth, and should adorn their chins."
400,11,451,"Phædra and Procris, with wise Minos’ flame,"
400,11,452,"Bright Ariadne, to the off’ring came."
400,11,453,"Whom whilome Theseus made his prise from Crete,"
400,11,454,"That Athens’ sacred soil might kiss her feet,"
400,11,455,"But never could obtain her virgin flow’r,"
400,11,456,"Till, in the sea - girt Dia, Dian’s pow’r"
400,11,457,"Detain’d his homeward haste, where (in her fane,"
400,11,458,By Bacchus witness’d) was the fatal wane
400,11,459,"Of her prime glory, Mæra, Clymene,"
400,11,460,"I witness’d there; and loath’d Eriphyle,"
400,11,461,That honour’d gold more than she lov’d her spouse.[5]
400,11,462,"But, all th’ heroesses in Pluto’s house"
400,11,463,"That then encounter’d me, exceeds my might"
400,11,464,"To name or number, and ambrosian night"
400,11,465,"Would quite be spent, when now the formal hours"
400,11,466,"Present to sleep our all disposéd pow’rs,"
400,11,467,"If at my ship, or here. My home - made vow"
400,11,468,I leave for fit grace to the Gods and you.”
400,11,469,This said; the silence his discourse had made
400,11,470,"With pleasure held still through the house’s shade,"
400,11,471,When white - arm’d Areté this speech began:
400,11,472,"“Phæacians! How appears to you this man,"
400,11,473,"So goodly person’d, and so match’d with mind?"
400,11,474,"My guest he is, but all you stand combin’d"
400,11,475,In the renown he doth us. Do not then
400,11,476,"With careless haste dismiss him, nor the main"
400,11,477,"Of his dispatch to one so needy maim,"
400,11,478,The Gods’ free bounty gives us all just claim
400,11,479,"To goods enow.” This speech, the oldest man"
400,11,480,"Of any other Phæacensian,"
400,11,481,"The grave heroë, Echinëus, gave"
400,11,482,"All approbation, saying: “Friends! ye have"
400,11,483,The motion of the wise queen in such words
400,11,484,"As have not miss’d the mark, with which accords"
400,11,485,"My clear opinion. But Alcinous,"
400,11,486,"In word and work, must be our rule.” He thus;"
400,11,487,"And then Alcinous said: “This then must stand,"
400,11,488,If while I live I rule in the command
400,11,489,Of this well - skill’d - in - navigation state:
400,11,490,"Endure then, guest, though most importunate"
400,11,491,Be your affects for home. A little stay
400,11,492,"If your expectance bear, perhaps it may"
400,11,493,Our gifts make more complete. The cares of all
400,11,494,Your due deduction asks; but principal
400,11,495,I am therein the ruler.” He replied:
400,11,496,"“Alcinous, the most duly glorified"
400,11,497,"With rule of all of all men, if you lay"
400,11,498,"Commandment on me of a whole year’s stay,"
400,11,499,"So all the while your preparations rise,"
400,11,500,"As well in gifts as time,[6] ye can devise"
400,11,501,No better wish for me; for I shall come
400,11,502,"Much fuller - handed, and more honoured, home,"
400,11,503,"And dearer to my people, in whose loves"
400,11,504,The richer evermore the better proves.”
400,11,505,He answer’d: “There is argued in your sight
400,11,506,"A worth that works not men for benefit,"
400,11,507,"Like prollers or impostors; of which crew,"
400,11,508,"The gentle black earth feeds not up a few,"
400,11,509,"Here and there wand’rers, blanching tales and lies,"
400,11,510,"Of neither praise, nor use. You move our eyes"
400,11,511,"With form, our minds with matter, and our ears"
400,11,512,"With elegant oration, such as bears"
400,11,513,A music in the order’d history
400,11,514,It lays before us. Not Demodocus
400,11,515,With sweeter strains hath us’d to sing to us
400,11,516,"All the Greek sorrows, wept out in your own."
400,11,517,"But say: Of all your worthy friends, were none"
400,11,518,Objected to your eyes that consorts were
400,11,519,"To Ilion with you, and serv’d destiny there?"
400,11,520,"This night is passing long, unmeasur’d, none"
400,11,521,"Of all my household would to bed yet; on,"
400,11,522,"Relate these wondrous things. Were I with you,"
400,11,523,"If you would tell me but your woes, as now,"
400,11,524,"Till the divine Aurora show’d her head,"
400,11,525,I should in no night relish thought of bed.”
400,11,526,"“Most eminent king,” said he, “times all must keep,"
400,11,527,"There’s time to speak much, time as much to sleep."
400,11,528,"But would you hear still, I will tell you still,"
400,11,529,"And utter more, more miserable ill"
400,11,530,"Of friends than yet, that scap’d the dismal wars,"
400,11,531,"And perish’d homewards, and in household jars"
400,11,532,Wag’d by a wicked woman. The chaste Queen
400,11,533,"No sooner made these lady ghosts unseen,"
400,11,534,"Here and there flitting, but mine eyesight won"
400,11,535,"The soul of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
400,11,536,"Sad, and about him all his train of friends,"
400,11,537,That in Ægisthus’ house endur’d their ends
400,11,538,"With his stern fortune. Having drunk the blood,"
400,11,539,"He knew me instantly, and forth a flood"
400,11,540,"Of springing tears gush’d; out he thrust his hands,"
400,11,541,"With will t’ embrace me, but their old commands"
400,11,542,"Flow’d not about him, nor their weakest part."
400,11,543,"I wept to see, and moan’d him from my heart,"
400,11,544,And ask’d: ‘O Agamemnon! King of men!
400,11,545,What sort of cruel death hath render’d slain
400,11,546,Thy royal person? Neptune in thy fleet
400,11,547,"Heav’n and his hellish billows making meet,"
400,11,548,Rousing the winds? Or have thy men by land
400,11,549,"Done thee this ill, for using thy command,"
400,11,550,"Past their consents, in diminution"
400,11,551,Of those full shares their worths by lot had won
400,11,552,"Of sheep or oxen? Or of any town,"
400,11,553,"In covetous strife, to make their rights thine own"
400,11,554,In men or women prisoners?’ He replied:
400,11,555,"‘By none of these in any right I died,"
400,11,556,But by Ægisthus and my murd’rous wife
400,11,557,(Bid to a banquet at his house) my life
400,11,558,"Hath thus been reft me, to my slaughter led"
400,11,559,Like to an ox pretended to be fed.
400,11,560,"So miserably fell I, and with me"
400,11,561,"My friends lay massacred, as when you see"
400,11,562,"At any rich man’s nuptials, shot, or feast,"
400,11,563,About his kitchen white - tooth’d swine lie drest.
400,11,564,"The slaughters of a world of men thine eyes,"
400,11,565,"Both private, and in prease of enemies,"
400,11,566,Have personally witness’d; but this one
400,11,567,"Would all thy parts have broken into moan,"
400,11,568,"To see how strew’d about our cups and cates,"
400,11,569,"As tables set with feast, so we with fates,"
400,11,570,"All gash’d and slain lay, all the floor embrued"
400,11,571,"With blood and brain. But that which most I rued,"
400,11,572,"Flew from the heavy voice that Priam’s seed,"
400,11,573,"Cassandra, breath’d, whom, she that wit doth feed"
400,11,574,"With baneful crafts, false Clytemnestra, slew,"
400,11,575,Close sitting by me; up my hands I threw
400,11,576,"From earth to heav’n, and tumbling on my sword"
400,11,577,"Gave wretched life up; when the most abhorr’d,"
400,11,578,"By all her sex’s shame, forsook the room,"
400,11,579,"Nor deign’d, though then so near this heavy home,"
400,11,580,"To shut my lips, or close my broken eyes."
400,11,581,"Nothing so heap’d is with impieties,"
400,11,582,As such a woman that would kill her spouse
400,11,583,That married her a maid. When to my house
400,11,584,"I brought her, hoping of her love in heart,"
400,11,585,"To children, maids, and slaves. But she (in th’ art"
400,11,586,Of only mischief hearty) not alone
400,11,587,"Cast on herself this foul aspersión,"
400,11,588,"But loving dames, hereafter, to their lords"
400,11,589,"Will bear, for good deeds, her bad thoughts and words.’"
400,11,590,"‘Alas,’ said I, ‘that Jove should hate the lives"
400,11,591,Of Atreus’ seed so highly for their wives!
400,11,592,"For Menelaus’ wife a number fell,"
400,11,593,For dang’rous absence thine sent thee to hell.’
400,11,594,"‘For this,’ he answer’d, ‘be not thou more kind"
400,11,595,Than wise to thy wife. Never all thy mind
400,11,596,"Let words express to her. Of all she knows,"
400,11,597,"Curbs for the worst still, in thyself repose."
400,11,598,"But thou by thy wife’s wiles shalt lose no blood,"
400,11,599,"Exceeding wise she is, and wise in good."
400,11,600,"Icarius’ daughter, chaste Penelope,"
400,11,601,"We left a young bride, when for battle we"
400,11,602,"Forsook the nuptial peace, and at her breast"
400,11,603,"Her first child sucking, who, by this hour, blest,"
400,11,604,Sits in the number of surviving men.
400,11,605,"And his bliss she hath, that she can contain,"
400,11,606,"And her bliss thou hast, that she is so wise."
400,11,607,"For, by her wisdom, thy returnéd eyes"
400,11,608,"Shall see thy son, and he shall greet his sire"
400,11,609,"With fitting welcomes; when in my retire,"
400,11,610,"My wife denies mine eyes my son’s dear sight,"
400,11,611,"And, as from me, will take from him the light,"
400,11,612,"Before she adds one just delight to life,"
400,11,613,Or her false wit one truth that fits a wife.
400,11,614,"For her sake therefore let my harms advise,"
400,11,615,"That though thy wife be ne’er so chaste and wise,"
400,11,616,"Yet come not home to her in open view,[7]"
400,11,617,"With any ship or any personal show,"
400,11,618,"But take close shore disguis’d, nor let her know,"
400,11,619,For ’tis no world to trust a woman now.
400,11,620,"But what says Fame? Doth my son yet survive,"
400,11,621,"In Orchomen, or Pylos? Or doth live"
400,11,622,In Sparta with his uncle? Yet I see
400,11,623,Divine Orestes is not here with me.’
400,11,624,"I answer’d, asking: ‘Why doth Atreus’ son"
400,11,625,"Enquire of me, who yet arriv’d where none"
400,11,626,Could give to these news any certain wings?
400,11,627,And ’tis absurd to tell uncertain things.’
400,11,628,"Such sad speech past us; and as thus we stood,"
400,11,629,"With kind tears rend’ring unkind fortunes good,"
400,11,630,"Achilles’ and Patroclus’ soul appear’d,"
400,11,631,"And his soul, of whom never ill was heard,"
400,11,632,"The good Antilochus, and the soul of him"
400,11,633,"That all the Greeks past both for force and limb,"
400,11,634,"Excepting the unmatch’d Æacides,"
400,11,635,Illustrious Ajax. But the first of these
400,11,636,"That saw, acknowledg’d, and saluted me,"
400,11,637,"Was Thetis’ conqu’ring son, who (heavily"
400,11,638,His state here taking) said: ‘Unworthy breath!
400,11,639,What act yet mightier imagineth
400,11,640,Thy vent’rous spirit? How dost thou descend
400,11,641,"These under - regions, where the dead man’s end"
400,11,642,"Is to be look’d on, and his foolish shade?’"
400,11,643,I answer’d him: ‘I was induc’d t’ invade
400,11,644,"These under - parts, most excellent of Greece,"
400,11,645,"To visit wise Tiresias, for advice"
400,11,646,Of virtue to direct my voyage home
400,11,647,To rugged Ithaca; since I could come
400,11,648,"To note in no place, where Achaia stood,"
400,11,649,"And so liv’d ever, tortur’d with the blood"
400,11,650,"In man’s vain veins. Thou, therefore, Thetis’ son,"
400,11,651,"Hast equall’d all, that ever yet have won"
400,11,652,"The bliss the earth yields, or hereafter shall."
400,11,653,"In life thy eminence was ador’d of all,"
400,11,654,"Ev’n with the Gods; and now, ev’n dead, I see"
400,11,655,Thy virtues propagate thy empery
400,11,656,To a renew’d life of command beneath;
400,11,657,So great Achilles triumphs over death.’
400,11,658,This comfort of him this encounter found;
400,11,659,"‘Urge not my death to me, nor rub that wound,"
400,11,660,"I rather wish to live in earth a swain,"
400,11,661,"Or serve a swain for hire, that scarce can gain"
400,11,662,"Bread to sustain him, than, that life once gone,"
400,11,663,Of all the dead sway the imperial throne.
400,11,664,"But say, and of my son some comfort yield,"
400,11,665,"If he goes on in first fights of the field,"
400,11,666,Or lurks for safety in the obscure rear?
400,11,667,Or of my father if thy royal ear
400,11,668,"Hath been advertis’d, that the Phthian throne"
400,11,669,"He still commands, as greatest Myrmidon?"
400,11,670,Or that the Phthian and Thessalian rage
400,11,671,(Now feet and hands are in the hold of age)
400,11,672,"Despise his empire? Under those bright rays,"
400,11,673,In which heav’n’s fervour hurls about the days.
400,11,674,"Must I no more shine his revenger now,"
400,11,675,Such as of old the Ilion overthrow
400,11,676,"Witness’d my anger, th’ universal host"
400,11,677,"Sending before me to this shady coast,"
400,11,678,"In fight for Grecia. Could I now resort,"
400,11,679,"(But for some small time) to my father’s court,"
400,11,680,"In spirit and pow’r as then, those men should find"
400,11,681,"My hands inaccessible, and of fire my mind,"
400,11,682,That durst with all the numbers they are strong
400,11,683,"Unseat his honour, and suborn his wrong.’"
400,11,684,"This pitch still flew his spirit, though so low,"
400,11,685,And this I answer’d thus: ‘I do not know
400,11,686,"Of blameless Peleus any least report,"
400,11,687,"But of your son, in all the utmost sort,"
400,11,688,"I can inform your care with truth, and thus:"
400,11,689,From Scyros princely Neoptolemus
400,11,690,"By fleet I convey’d to the Greeks, where he"
400,11,691,"Was chief, at both parts, when our gravity"
400,11,692,"Retir’d to council, and our youth to fight."
400,11,693,In council still so fiery was Conceit
400,11,694,"In his quick apprehension of a cause,"
400,11,695,"That first he ever spake, nor pass’d the laws"
400,11,696,"Of any great stay, in his greatest haste."
400,11,697,"None would contend with him, that counsell’d last,"
400,11,698,"Unless illustrious Nestor, he and I"
400,11,699,Would sometimes put a friendly contrary
400,11,700,"On his opinion. In our fights, the prease"
400,11,701,"Of great or common, he would never cease,"
400,11,702,"But far before fight ever. No man there,"
400,11,703,"For force, he forcéd. He was slaughterer"
400,11,704,Of many a brave man in most dreadful fight.
400,11,705,"But one and other whom he reft of light,"
400,11,706,"In Grecian succour, I can neither name,"
400,11,707,Nor give in number. The particular fame
400,11,708,Of one man’s slaughter yet I must not pass;
400,11,709,"Eurypylus Telephides he was,"
400,11,710,"That fell beneath him, and with him the falls"
400,11,711,"Of such huge men went, that they show’d like whales[8]"
400,11,712,Rampir’d about him. Neoptolemus
400,11,713,"Set him so sharply, for the sumptuous"
400,11,714,Favours of mistresses he saw him wear;
400,11,715,For past all doubt his beauties had no peer
400,11,716,"Of all that mine eyes noted, next to one,"
400,11,717,"And that was Memnon, Tithon’s Sun - like son."
400,11,718,"Thus far, for fight in public, may a taste"
400,11,719,Give of his eminence. How far surpast
400,11,720,"His spirit in private, where he was not seen,"
400,11,721,"Nor glory could be said to praise his spleen,"
400,11,722,This close note I excerpted. When we sat
400,11,723,"Hid in Epëus’ horse, no optimate"
400,11,724,Of all the Greeks there had the charge to ope
400,11,725,And shut the stratagem but I.[9] My scope
400,11,726,To note then each man’s spirit in a strait
400,11,727,"Of so much danger, much the better might"
400,11,728,"Be hit by me, than others, as, provok’d,"
400,11,729,"I shifted place still, when, in some I smok’d"
400,11,730,"Both privy tremblings, and close vent of tears,"
400,11,731,In him yet not a soft conceit of theirs
400,11,732,"Could all my search see, either his wet eyes"
400,11,733,"Ply’d still with wipings, or the goodly guise,"
400,11,734,"His person all ways put forth, in least part,"
400,11,735,"By any tremblings, show’d his touch’d - at heart."
400,11,736,But ever he was urging me to make
400,11,737,"Way to their sally, by his sign to shake"
400,11,738,"His sword hid in his scabbard, or his lance"
400,11,739,"Loaded with iron, at me. No good chance"
400,11,740,"His thoughts to Troy intended. In th’ event,"
400,11,741,"High Troy depopulate, he made ascent"
400,11,742,"To his fair ship, with prise and treasure store,"
400,11,743,"Safe, and no touch away with him he bore"
400,11,744,"Of far - off - hurl’d lance, or of close - fought sword,"
400,11,745,"Whose wounds for favours war doth oft afford,"
400,11,746,Which he (though sought) miss’d in war’s closest wage.
400,11,747,"_In close fights Mars doth never fight, but rage.’_"
400,11,748,This made the soul of swift Achilles tread
400,11,749,"A march of glory through the herby mead,"
400,11,750,For joy to hear me so renown his son;
400,11,751,And vanish’d stalking. But with passión
400,11,752,"Stood th’ other souls struck, and each told his bane."
400,11,753,Only the spirit Telamonian[10]
400,11,754,"Kept far off, angry for the victory"
400,11,755,I won from him at fleet; though arbitry
400,11,756,"Of all a court of war pronounc’d it mine,"
400,11,757,And Pallas’ self. Our prise were th’ arms divine
400,11,758,"Of great Æacides, proposd t’ our fames"
400,11,759,"By his bright Mother, at his funeral games."
400,11,760,I wish to heav’n I ought not to have won;
400,11,761,Since for those arms so high a head so soon
400,11,762,"The base earth cover’d, Ajax, that of all"
400,11,763,"The host of Greece had person capital,"
400,11,764,"And acts as eminent, excepting his"
400,11,765,"Whose arms those were, in whom was nought amiss."
400,11,766,"I tried the great soul with soft words, and said:"
400,11,767,"‘Ajax! Great son of Telamon, array’d"
400,11,768,In all our glories! What! not dead resign
400,11,769,Thy wrath for those curst arms? The Pow’rs divine
400,11,770,"In them forg’d all our banes, in thine own one,"
400,11,771,In thy grave fall our tower was overthrown.
400,11,772,"We mourn, for ever maim’d, for thee as much"
400,11,773,"As for Achilles; nor thy wrong doth touch,"
400,11,774,"In sentence, any but Saturnius’ doom;"
400,11,775,In whose hate was the host of Greece become
400,11,776,A very horror; who express’d it well
400,11,777,In signing thy fate with this timeless hell.
400,11,778,"Approach then, king of all the Grecian merit,"
400,11,779,"Repress thy great mind and thy flamy spirit,"
400,11,780,And give the words I give thee worthy ear.’
400,11,781,"All this no word drew from him, but less near"
400,11,782,"The stern soul kept; to other souls he fled,"
400,11,783,And glid along the river of the dead.
400,11,784,"Though anger mov’d him, yet he might have spoke,"
400,11,785,Since I to him. But my desires were strook
400,11,786,With sight of other souls. And then I saw
400,11,787,"Minos, that minister’d to Death a law,"
400,11,788,"And Jove’s bright son was. He was set, and sway’d"
400,11,789,A golden sceptre; and to him did plead
400,11,790,"A sort of others, set about his throne,"
400,11,791,In Pluto’s wide - door’d house; when straight came on
400,11,792,"Mighty Orion, who was hunting there"
400,11,793,The herds of those beasts he had slaughter’d here
400,11,794,"In desert hills on earth. A club he bore,"
400,11,795,"Entirely steel, whose virtues never wore."
400,11,796,"Tityus I saw, to whom the glorious earth"
400,11,797,"Open’d her womb, and gave unhappy birth."
400,11,798,"Upwards, and flat upon the pavement, lay"
400,11,799,"His ample limbs, that spread in their display"
400,11,800,Nine acres’ compass. On his bosom sat
400,11,801,"Two vultures, digging, through his caul of fat,"
400,11,802,Into his liver with their crookéd beaks;
400,11,803,And each by turns the concrete entrail breaks
400,11,804,(As smiths their steel beat) set on either side.
400,11,805,Nor doth he ever labour to divide
400,11,806,"His liver and their beaks, nor with his hand"
400,11,807,"Offer them off, but suffers by command"
400,11,808,"Of th’ angry Thund’rer, off’ring to enforce"
400,11,809,"His love Latona, in the close recourse"
400,11,810,"She us’d to Pytho through the dancing land,"
400,11,811,"Smooth Panopëus, I saw likewise stand,"
400,11,812,"Up to the chin, amidst a liquid lake,"
400,11,813,"Tormented Tantalus, yet could not slake"
400,11,814,His burning thirst. Oft as his scornful cup
400,11,815,"Th’ old man would taste, so oft ’twas swallow’d up,"
400,11,816,"And all the black earth to his feet descried,"
400,11,817,Divine pow’r (plaguing him) the lake still dried.
400,11,818,"About his head, on high trees, clust’ring, hung"
400,11,819,"Pears, apples, granates, olives ever - young,"
400,11,820,"Delicious figs, and many fruit - trees more"
400,11,821,Of other burden; whose alluring store
400,11,822,"When th’ old soul striv’d to pluck, the winds from sight,"
400,11,823,"In gloomy vapours, made them vanish quite."
400,11,824,"There saw I Sisyphus in infinite moan,"
400,11,825,"With both hands heaving up a massy stone,"
400,11,826,"And on his tip - toes racking all his height,"
400,11,827,To wrest up to a mountain - top his freight;
400,11,828,"When prest to rest it there, his nerves quite spent,"
400,11,829,"Down rush’d the deadly quarry, the event"
400,11,830,Of all his torture new to raise again;
400,11,831,To which straight set his never - rested pain.
400,11,832,The sweat came gushing out from ev’ry pore
400,11,833,"And on his head a standing mist he wore,"
400,11,834,"Reeking from thence, as if a cloud of dust"
400,11,835,Were rais’d about it. Down with these was thrust
400,11,836,"The idol of the force of Hercules,"
400,11,837,"But his firm self did no such fate oppress,"
400,11,838,"He feasting lives amongst th’ Immortal States,"
400,11,839,White - ankled Hebe and himself made mates
400,11,840,"In heav’nly nuptials. Hebe, Jove’s dear race,"
400,11,841,And Juno’s whom the golden sandals grace.
400,11,842,About him flew the clamours of the dead
400,11,843,"Like fowls, and still stoop’d cuffing at his head."
400,11,844,"He with his bow, like Night, stalk’d up and down,"
400,11,845,"His shaft still nock’d, and hurling round his frown"
400,11,846,"At those vex’d hov’rers, aiming at them still,"
400,11,847,"And still, as shooting out, desire to still."
400,11,848,"A horrid bawdrick wore he thwart his breast,"
400,11,849,"The thong all - gold, in which were forms imprest,"
400,11,850,"Where art and miracle drew equal breaths,"
400,11,851,"In bears, boars, lions, battles, combats, deaths,"
400,11,852,"Who wrought that work did never such before,"
400,11,853,Nor so divinely will do ever more.
400,11,854,"Soon as he saw, he knew me, and gave speech:"
400,11,855,"‘Son of Laertes, high in wisdom’s reach,"
400,11,856,"And yet unhappy wretch, for in this heart,"
400,11,857,"Of all exploits achiev’d by thy desert,"
400,11,858,"Thy worth but works out some sinister fate,"
400,11,859,As I in earth did. I was generate
400,11,860,"By Jove himself, and yet past mean opprest"
400,11,861,"By one my far inferior, whose proud hest"
400,11,862,Impos’d abhorréd labours on my hand.
400,11,863,"Of all which one was, to descend this strand,"
400,11,864,And hale the dog from thence. He could not think
400,11,865,An act that danger could make deeper sink.
400,11,866,"And yet this depth I drew, and fetch’d as high,"
400,11,867,"As this was low, the dog. The Deity"
400,11,868,"Of sleight and wisdom, as of downright pow’r,"
400,11,869,"Both stoop’d, and rais’d, and made me conqueror.’"
400,11,870,"This said, he made descent again as low"
400,11,871,"As Pluto’s court; when I stood firm, for show"
400,11,872,"Of more heroës of the times before,"
400,11,873,"And might perhaps have seen my wish of more,"
400,11,874,"(As Theseus and Pirithous, deriv’d"
400,11,875,From roots of Deity) but before th’ achiev’d
400,11,876,"Rare sight of these, the rank - soul’d multitude"
400,11,877,"In infinite flocks rose, venting sounds so rude,"
400,11,878,"That pale Fear took me, lest the Gorgon’s head"
400,11,879,"Rush’d in amongst them, thrust up, in my dread,"
400,11,880,By grim Persephoné. I therefore sent
400,11,881,"My men before to ship, and after went."
400,11,882,"Where, boarded, set, and launch’d, the ocean wave"

400,12,2,He shows from Hell his safe retreat
400,12,3,"To th’ isle Ææa, Circe’s seat;"
400,12,4,"And how he ’scap’d the Sirens’ calls,"
400,12,5,"With th’ erring rocks, and waters’ falls,"
400,12,6,That Scylla and Charybdis break;
400,12,7,The Sun’ s stol’ n herds; and his sad wreak
400,12,8,"Both of Ulysses’ ship and men,"
400,12,9,His own head ’scaping scarce the pain.

400,12,12,"The rocks that err’d,"
400,12,13,The Sirens’ call.
400,12,14,The Sun’s stol’n herd.
400,12,15,The soldiers’ fall.
400,12,16,"“Our ship now past the straits of th’ ocean flood,"
400,12,17,"She plow’d the broad sea’s billows, and made good"
400,12,18,"The isle Ææa, where the palace stands"
400,12,19,"Of th’ early riser with the rosy hands,"
400,12,20,"Active Aurora, where she loves to dance,"
400,12,21,And where the Sun doth his prime beams advance.
400,12,22,"When here arriv’d, we drew her up to land,"
400,12,23,"And trod ourselves the re - saluted sand,"
400,12,24,"Found on the shore fit resting for the night,"
400,12,25,"Slept, and expected the celestial light."
400,12,26,Soon as the white - and - red - mix’d finger’d Dame
400,12,27,"Had gilt the mountains with her saffron flame,"
400,12,28,"I sent my men to Circe’s house before,"
400,12,29,To fetch deceas’d Elpenor to the shore.
400,12,30,"Straight swell’d the high banks with fell’d heaps of trees,"
400,12,31,"And, full of tears, we did due exsequies"
400,12,32,"To our dead friend. Whose corse consum’d with fire,"
400,12,33,"And honour’d arms, whose sepulchre entire,"
400,12,34,"And over that a column rais’d, his oar,"
400,12,35,"Curiously carv’d, to his desire before,"
400,12,36,Upon the top of all his tomb we fix’d.
400,12,37,Of all rites fit his funeral pile was mix’d.
400,12,38,Nor was our safe ascent from Hell conceal’d
400,12,39,From Circe’s knowledge; nor so soon reveal’d
400,12,40,"But she was with us, with her bread and food,"
400,12,41,"And ruddy wine, brought by her sacred brood"
400,12,42,"Of woods and fountains. In the midst she stood,"
400,12,43,"And thus saluted us; ‘Unhappy men,"
400,12,44,"That have, inform’d with all your senses, been"
400,12,45,In Pluto’s dismal mansion! You shall die
400,12,46,"Twice now, where others, that Mortality"
400,12,47,"In her fair arms holds, shall but once decease."
400,12,48,"But eat and drink out all conceit of these,"
400,12,49,"And this day dedicate to food and wine,"
400,12,50,The following night to sleep. When next shall shine
400,12,51,"The cheerful morning, you shall prove the seas."
400,12,52,"Your way, and ev’ry act ye must address,"
400,12,53,"My knowledge of their order shall design,"
400,12,54,Lest with your own bad counsels ye incline
400,12,55,"Events as bad against ye, and sustain,"
400,12,56,"By sea and shore, the woful ends that reign"
400,12,57,In wilful actions.’ Thus did she advise
400,12,58,"And, for the time, our fortunes were so wise"
400,12,59,To follow wise directions. All that day
400,12,60,We sat and feasted. When his lower way
400,12,61,"The Sun had entered, and the Even the high,"
400,12,62,My friends slept on their gables; she and I
400,12,63,"(Led by her fair hand to place apart,"
400,12,64,By her well - sorted) did to sleep convert
400,12,65,Our timid pow’rs; when all things Fate let fall
400,12,66,In our affair she ask’d; I told her all.
400,12,67,To which she answer’d: ‘These things thus took end.
400,12,68,"And now to those that I inform attend,"
400,12,69,"Which you rememb’ring, God himself shall be"
400,12,70,The blesséd author of your memory.
400,12,71,"First to the Sirens ye shall come, that taint"
400,12,72,The minds of all men whom they can acquaint
400,12,73,"With their attractions. Whosoever shall,"
400,12,74,"For want of knowledge mov’d, but hear the call"
400,12,75,"Of any Siren, he will so despise"
400,12,76,"Both wife and children, for their sorceries,"
400,12,77,"That never home turns his affection’s stream,"
400,12,78,"Nor they take joy in him, nor he in them."
400,12,79,The Sirens will so soften with their song
400,12,80,"(Shrill, and in sensual appetite so strong)"
400,12,81,"His loose affections, that he gives them head."
400,12,82,"And then observe: They sit amidst a mead,"
400,12,83,And round about it runs a hedge or wall
400,12,84,"Of dead men’s bones, their wither’d skins and all"
400,12,85,Hung all along upon it; and these men
400,12,86,"Were such as they had fawn’d into their fen,"
400,12,87,And then their skins hung on their hedge of bones.
400,12,88,"Sail by them therefore, thy companions"
400,12,89,Beforehand causing to stop ev’ry ear
400,12,90,"With sweet soft wax, so close that none may hear"
400,12,91,"A note of all their charmings. Yet may you,"
400,12,92,"If you affect it, open ear allow"
400,12,93,To try their motion; but presume not so
400,12,94,"To trust your judgment, when your senses go"
400,12,95,"So loose about you, but give strait command"
400,12,96,"To all your men, to bind you foot and hand"
400,12,97,"Sure to the mast, that you may safe approve"
400,12,98,How strong in instigation to their love
400,12,99,"Their rapting tunes are. If so much they move,"
400,12,100,"That, spite of all your reason, your will stands"
400,12,101,"To be enfranchis’d both of feet and hands,"
400,12,102,"Charge all your men before to slight your charge,"
400,12,103,And rest so far from fearing to enlarge
400,12,104,That much more sure they bind you. When your friends
400,12,105,"Have outsail’d these, the danger that transcends"
400,12,106,"Rests not in any counsel to prevent,"
400,12,107,Unless your own mind finds the tract and bent
400,12,108,Of that way that avoids it. I can say
400,12,109,"That in your course there lies a twofold way,"
400,12,110,"The right of which your own, taught, present wit,"
400,12,111,"And grace divine, must prompt. In gen’ral yet"
400,12,112,Let this inform you: Near these Sirens’ shore
400,12,113,"Move two steep rocks, at whose feet lie and roar"
400,12,114,The black sea’s cruel billows; the bless’d Gods
400,12,115,Call them the Rovers. Their abhorr’d abodes
400,12,116,"No bird can pass; no not the doves, whose fear[1]"
400,12,117,Sire Jove so loves that they are said to bear
400,12,118,"Ambrosia to him, can their ravine ’scape,"
400,12,119,But one of them falls ever to the rape
400,12,120,Of those sly rocks; yet Jove another still
400,12,121,"Adds to the rest, that so may ever fill"
400,12,122,The sacred number. Never ship could shun
400,12,123,"The nimble peril wing’d there, but did run"
400,12,124,"With all her bulk, and bodies of her men,"
400,12,125,To utter ruin. For the seas retain
400,12,126,"Not only their outrageous æsture there,"
400,12,127,"But fierce assistants of particular fear,"
400,12,128,"And supernatural mischief, they exspire,"
400,12,129,And those are whirlwinds of devouring fire
400,12,130,"Whisking about still. Th’ Argive ship alone,"
400,12,131,"Which bore the care of all men, got her gone,[2]"
400,12,132,Come from Areta. Yet perhaps ev’n she
400,12,133,"Had wrack’d at those rocks, if the Deity,"
400,12,134,"That lies by Jove’s side, had not lent her hand"
400,12,135,"To their transmission; since the man, that mann’d"
400,12,136,"In chief that voyage, she in chief did love."
400,12,137,"Of these two spiteful rocks, the one doth shove"
400,12,138,Against the height of heav’n her pointed brow.
400,12,139,"A black cloud binds it round, and never show"
400,12,140,Lends to the sharp point; not the clear blue sky
400,12,141,"Lets ever view it, not the summer’s eye,"
400,12,142,Nor fervent autumn’s. None that death could end
400,12,143,"Could ever scale it, or, if up, descend,"
400,12,144,"Though twenty hands and feet he had for hold,"
400,12,145,A polish’d ice - like glibness doth enfold
400,12,146,"The rock so round, whose midst a gloomy cell"
400,12,147,Shrouds so far westward that it sees to hell.
400,12,148,"From this keep you as far, as from his bow"
400,12,149,An able young man can his shaft bestow.
400,12,150,"For here the whuling Scylla shrouds her face,[3]"
400,12,151,That breathes a voice at all parts no more base
400,12,152,"Than are a newly - kitten’d kitling’s cries,"
400,12,153,"Herself a monster yet of boundless size,"
400,12,154,"Whose sight would nothing please a mortal’s eyes,"
400,12,155,"No nor the eyes of any God, if he"
400,12,156,"(Whom nought should fright) fell foul on her, and she"
400,12,157,Her full shape show’d. Twelve foul feet bear about
400,12,158,Her ugly bulk. Six huge long necks look out
400,12,159,Of her rank shoulders; ev’ry neck doth let
400,12,160,"A ghastly head out; ev’ry head three set,"
400,12,161,"Thick thrust together, of abhorréd teeth,"
400,12,162,And ev’ry tooth stuck with a sable death.
400,12,163,"She lurks in midst of all her den, and streaks"
400,12,164,From out a ghastly whirlpool all her necks;
400,12,165,"Where, gloting round her rock, to fish she falls;"
400,12,166,"And up rush dolphins, dogfish; somewhiles whales"
400,12,167,If got within her when her rapine feeds;
400,12,168,For ever - groaning Amphitrite breeds
400,12,169,About her whirlpool an unmeasur’d store.
400,12,170,No sea - man ever boasted touch of shore
400,12,171,"That there touch’d with his ship, but still she fed"
400,12,172,Of him and his; a man for ev’ry head
400,12,173,Spoiling his ship of. You shall then descry
400,12,174,"The other humbler rock, that moves so nigh"
400,12,175,Your dart may mete the distance. It receives
400,12,176,"A huge wild fig - tree, curl’d with ample leaves,"
400,12,177,"Beneath whose shades divine Charybdis sits,"
400,12,178,Supping the black deeps. Thrice a day her pits
400,12,179,"She drinking all dry, and thrice a day again"
400,12,180,"All up she belches, baneful to sustain."
400,12,181,"When she is drinking, dare not near her draught,"
400,12,182,"For not the force of Neptune, if once caught,"
400,12,183,"Can force your freedom. Therefore, in your strife"
400,12,184,"To ’scape Charybdis, labour all for life"
400,12,185,"To row near Scylla, for she will but have"
400,12,186,For her six heads six men; and better save
400,12,187,"The rest, than all make off’rings to the wave.’"
400,12,188,"This need she told me of my loss, when I"
400,12,189,"Desir’d to know, if that Necessity,"
400,12,190,"When I had ’scap’d Charybdis’ outrages,"
400,12,191,"My pow’rs might not revenge, though not redress?"
400,12,192,She answer’d: ‘O unhappy! art thou yet
400,12,193,"Enflam’d with war, and thirst to drink thy sweat?"
400,12,194,Not to the Gods give up both arms and will?
400,12,195,"She deathless is, and that immortal ill"
400,12,196,"Grave, harsh, outrageous, not to be subdued,"
400,12,197,That men must suffer till they be renew’d.
400,12,198,Nor lives there any virtue that can fly
400,12,199,The vicious outrage of their cruelty.
400,12,200,"Shouldst thou put arms on, and approach the rock,"
400,12,201,I fear six more must expiate the shock.
400,12,202,"Six heads six men ask still. Hoise sail, and fly,"
400,12,203,"And, in thy flight, aloud on Cratis cry"
400,12,204,"(Great Scylla’s mother, who expos’d to light"
400,12,205,The bane of men) and she will do such right
400,12,206,"To thy observance, that she down will tread"
400,12,207,"Her daughter’s rage, nor let her show a head."
400,12,208,"From thenceforth then, for ever past her care,"
400,12,209,"Thou shalt ascend the isle triangular,"
400,12,210,"Where many oxen of the Sun are fed,"
400,12,211,And fatted flocks. Of oxen fifty head
400,12,212,"In ev’ry herd feed, and their herds are seven;"
400,12,213,And of his fat flocks is their number even.
400,12,214,"Increase they yield not, for they never die."
400,12,215,There ev’ry shepherdess a Deity.
400,12,216,"Fair Phaëthusa, and Lampetié,"
400,12,217,"The lovely Nymphs are that their guardians be,"
400,12,218,Who to the daylight’s lofty - going Flame
400,12,219,"Had gracious birthright from the heav’nly Dame,"
400,12,220,Still young Neæra; who (brought forth and bred)
400,12,221,"Far off dismiss’d them, to see duly fed"
400,12,222,Their father’s herds and flocks in Sicily.
400,12,223,These herds and flocks if to the Deity
400,12,224,"Ye leave, as sacred things, untouch’d, and on"
400,12,225,"Go with all fit care of your home, alone,"
400,12,226,(Though through some suff’rance) you yet safe shall land
400,12,227,In wishéd Ithaca. But if impious hand
400,12,228,"You lay on those herds to their hurts, I then"
400,12,229,Presage sure ruin to thy ship and men.
400,12,230,"If thou escap’st thyself, extending home"
400,12,231,"Thy long’d - for landing, thou shalt loaded come"
400,12,232,"With store of losses, most exceeding late,"
400,12,233,And not consorted with a savéd mate.’
400,12,234,"This said, the golden - thron’d Aurora rose,"
400,12,235,"She her way went, and I did mine dispose"
400,12,236,"Up to my ship, weigh’d anchor, and away."
400,12,237,When rev’rend Circe help’d us to convey
400,12,238,"Our vessel safe, by making well inclin’d"
400,12,239,"A seaman’s true companion, a forewind,"
400,12,240,"With which she fill’d our sails; when, fitting all"
400,12,241,"Our arms close by us, I did sadly fall"
400,12,242,To grave relation what concern’d in fate
400,12,243,"My friends to know, and told them that the state"
400,12,244,"Of our affairs’ success, which Circe had"
400,12,245,"Presag’d to me alone, must yet be made"
400,12,246,"To one nor only two known, but to all;"
400,12,247,"That, since their lives and deaths were left to fall"
400,12,248,"In their elections, they might life elect,"
400,12,249,And give what would preserve it fit effect.
400,12,250,"I first inform’d them, that we were to fly"
400,12,251,"The heav’nly - singing Sirens’ harmony,"
400,12,252,And flow’r - adorned meadow; and that I
400,12,253,"Had charge to hear their song, but fetter’d fast"
400,12,254,"In bands, unfavour’d, to th’ erected mast,"
400,12,255,"From whence, if I should pray, or use command,"
400,12,256,"To be enlarg’d, they should with much more band"
400,12,257,Contain my strugglings. This I simply told
400,12,258,"To each particular, nor would withhold"
400,12,259,"What most enjoin’d mine own affection’s stay,"
400,12,260,That theirs the rather might be taught t’ obey.
400,12,261,"In mean time flew our ships, and straight we fetch’d"
400,12,262,The Siren’s isle; a spleenless wind so stretch’d
400,12,263,"Her wings to waft us, and so urg’d our keel."
400,12,264,"But having reach’d this isle, we could not feel"
400,12,265,"The least gasp of it, it was stricken dead,"
400,12,266,"And all the sea in prostrate slumber spread,"
400,12,267,The Sirens’ devil charm’d all. Up then flew
400,12,268,"My friends to work, struck sail, together drew,"
400,12,269,"And under hatches stow’d them, sat, and plied"
400,12,270,"The polish’d oars, and did in curls divide"
400,12,271,The white - head waters. My part then came on:
400,12,272,"A mighty waxen cake I set upon,"
400,12,273,"Chopp’d it in fragments with my sword, and wrought"
400,12,274,"With strong hand ev’ry piece, till all were soft."
400,12,275,"The great pow’r of the sun, in such a beam"
400,12,276,"As then flew burning from his diadem,"
400,12,277,To liquefaction help’d us. Orderly
400,12,278,I stopp’d their ears; and they as fair did ply
400,12,279,"My feet and hands with cords, and to the mast"
400,12,280,With other halsers made me soundly fast.
400,12,281,"Then took they seat, and forth our passage strook,"
400,12,282,The foamy sea beneath their labour shook.
400,12,283,"Row’d on, in reach of an erected voice,"
400,12,284,"The Sirens soon took note, without our noise,"
400,12,285,"Tun’d those sweet accents that made charms so strong,"
400,12,286,And these learn’d numbers made the Sirens’ song:
400,12,287,"_‘Come here, thou worthy of a world of praise,"
400,12,288,"That dost so high the Grecian glory raise,"
400,12,289,"Ulysses! stay thy ship, and that song hear"
400,12,290,"That none pass’d ever but it bent his ear,"
400,12,291,"But left him ravish’d, and instructed more"
400,12,292,"By us, than any ever heard before."
400,12,293,For we know all things whatsoever were
400,12,294,In wide Troy labour’d; whatsoever there
400,12,295,The Grecians and the Trojans both sustain’d
400,12,296,By those high issues that the Gods ordain’d.
400,12,297,And whatsoever all the earth can show
400,12,298,"T’ inform a knowledge of desert, we know.’_"
400,12,299,This they gave accent in the sweetest strain
400,12,300,That ever open’d an enamour’d vein.
400,12,301,When my constrain’d heart needs would have mine ear
400,12,302,"Yet more delighted, force way forth, and hear."
400,12,303,To which end I commanded with all sign
400,12,304,Stern looks could make (for not a joint of mine
400,12,305,"Had pow’r to stir) my friends to rise, and give"
400,12,306,My limbs free way. They freely striv’d to drive
400,12,307,"Their ship still on. When, far from will to loose,"
400,12,308,Eurylochus and Perimedes rose
400,12,309,"To wrap me surer, and oppress’d me more"
400,12,310,With many a halser than had use before.
400,12,311,"When, rowing on without the reach of sound,"
400,12,312,"My friends unstopp’d their ears, and me unbound,"
400,12,313,And that isle quite we quitted. But again
400,12,314,Fresh fears employ’d us. I beheld a main
400,12,315,"Of mighty billows, and a smoke ascend,"
400,12,316,A horrid murmur hearing. Ev’ry friend
400,12,317,Astonish’d sat; from ev’ry hand his Oar
400,12,318,Fell quite forsaken; with the dismal roar
400,12,319,Were all things there made echoes; stone - still stood
400,12,320,"Our ship itself, because the ghastly flood"
400,12,321,Took all men’s motions from her in their own.
400,12,322,"I through the ship went, labouring up and down"
400,12,323,My friends’ recover’d spirits. One by one
400,12,324,"I gave good words, and said: That well were known"
400,12,325,"These ills to them before, I told them all,"
400,12,326,And that these could not prove more capital
400,12,327,"Than those the Cyclops block’d us up in, yet"
400,12,328,"My virtue, wit, and heav’n - help’d counsels set"
400,12,329,Their freedoms open. I could not believe
400,12,330,"But they remember’d it, and wish’d them give"
400,12,331,My equal care and means now equal trust.
400,12,332,The strength they had for stirring up they must
400,12,333,"Rouse and extend, to try if Jove had laid"
400,12,334,"His pow’rs in theirs up, and would add his aid"
400,12,335,"To ’scape ev’n that death. In particular then,"
400,12,336,"I told our pilot, that past other men"
400,12,337,"He most must bear firm spirits, since he sway’d"
400,12,338,"The continent that all our spirits convey’d,"
400,12,339,In his whole guide of her. He saw there boil
400,12,340,The fiery whirlpools that to all our spoil
400,12,341,"Inclos’d a rock, without which he must steer,"
400,12,342,Or all our ruins stood concluded there.
400,12,343,"All heard me and obey’d, and little knew"
400,12,344,"That, shunning that rock, six of them should rue"
400,12,345,The wrack another hid. For I conceal’d
400,12,346,"The heavy wounds, that never would be heal’d,"
400,12,347,To be by Scylla open’d; for their fear
400,12,348,"Would then have robb’d all of all care to steer,"
400,12,349,"Or stir an oar, and made them hide beneath,"
400,12,350,When they and all had died an idle death.
400,12,351,But then ev’n I forgot to shun the harm
400,12,352,"Circe forewarn’d; who will’d I should not arm,"
400,12,353,"Nor show myself to Scylla, lest in vain"
400,12,354,"I ventur’d life. Yet could not I contain,"
400,12,355,"But arm’d at all parts, and two lances took,"
400,12,356,"Up to the foredeck went, and thence did look"
400,12,357,That rocky Scylla would have first appear’d
400,12,358,And taken my life with the friends I fear’d.
400,12,359,"From thence yet no place could afford her sight,"
400,12,360,"Though through the dark rock mine eye threw her light,"
400,12,361,And ransack’d all ways. I then took a strait
400,12,362,"That gave myself, and some few more, receit"
400,12,363,’Twixt Scylla and Charybdis; whence we saw
400,12,364,How horridly Charybdis’ throat did draw
400,12,365,"The brackish sea up, which when all aboard"
400,12,366,"She spit again out, never caldron sod"
400,12,367,"With so much fervour, fed with all the store"
400,12,368,That could enrage it; all the rock did roar
400,12,369,With troubled waters; round about the tops
400,12,370,Of all the steep crags flew the foamy drops.
400,12,371,"But when her draught the sea and earth dissunder’d,"
400,12,372,"The troubled bottoms turn’d up, and she thunder’d,"
400,12,373,Far under shore the swart sands naked lay.
400,12,374,Whose whole stern sight the startled blood did fray
400,12,375,From all our faces. And while we on her
400,12,376,"Our eyes bestow’d thus to our ruin’s fear,"
400,12,377,"Six friends had Scylla snatch’d out of our keel,"
400,12,378,In whom most loss did force and virtue feel.
400,12,379,"When looking to my ship, and lending eye"
400,12,380,"To see my friends’ estates, their heels turn’d high,"
400,12,381,"And hands cast up, I might discern, and hear"
400,12,382,"Their calls to me for help, when now they were"
400,12,383,To try me in their last extremities.
400,12,384,And as an angler med’cine for surprise
400,12,385,"Of little fish sits pouring from the rocks,"
400,12,386,"From out the crook’d horn of a fold - bred ox,"
400,12,387,And then with his long angle hoists them high
400,12,388,"Up to the air, then slightly hurls them by,"
400,12,389,When helpless sprawling on the land they lie;
400,12,390,So eas’ly Scylla to her rock had rapt
400,12,391,"My woeful friends, and so unhelp’d entrapt"
400,12,392,"Struggling they lay beneath her violent rape,"
400,12,393,"Who in their tortures, desp’rate of escape,"
400,12,394,"Shriek’d as she tore, and up their hands to me"
400,12,395,"Still threw for sweet life. I did never see,"
400,12,396,"In all my suff’rance ransacking the seas,"
400,12,397,A spectacle so full of miseries.
400,12,398,Thus having fled these rocks (these cruel dames
400,12,399,"Scylla, Charybdis) where the King of flames"
400,12,400,"Hath off’rings burn’d to him, our ship put in"
400,12,401,The island that from all the earth doth win
400,12,402,"The epithet _Faultless,_ where the broad - of - head"
400,12,403,"And famous oxen for the Sun are fed,"
400,12,404,With many fat flocks of that high - gone God.
400,12,405,"Set in my ship, mine ear reach’d where we rode"
400,12,406,"The bellowing of oxen, and the bleat"
400,12,407,"Of fleecy sheep, that in my memory’s seat"
400,12,408,Put up the forms that late had been imprest
400,12,409,"By dread Ææn Circe, and the best"
400,12,410,"Of souls and prophets, the blind Theban seer,"
400,12,411,"The wise Tiresias, who was grave decreer"
400,12,412,Of my return’s whole means; of which this one
400,12,413,In chief he urg’d — that I should always shun
400,12,414,The island of the man - delighting Sun.
400,12,415,"When, sad at heart for our late loss, I pray’d"
400,12,416,My friends to hear fit counsel (though dismay’d
400,12,417,With all ill fortunes) which was giv’n to me
400,12,418,"By Circe’s and Tiresias’ prophecy, —"
400,12,419,That I should fly the isle where was ador’d
400,12,420,"The Comfort of the world, for ills abhorr’d"
400,12,421,Were ambush’d for us there; and therefore will’d
400,12,422,They should put off and leave the isle. This kill’d
400,12,423,Their tender spirits; when Eurylochus
400,12,424,"A speech that vex’d me utter’d, answ’ring thus:"
400,12,425,‘Cruel Ulysses! Since thy nerves abound
400,12,426,"In strength, the more spent, and no toils confound"
400,12,427,"Thy able limbs, as all beat out of steel,"
400,12,428,"Thou ablest us too, as unapt to feel"
400,12,429,"The teeth of Labour, and the spoil of Sleep,"
400,12,430,"And therefore still wet waste us in the deep,"
400,12,431,"Nor let us land to eat, but madly now"
400,12,432,"In night put forth, and leave firm land to strew"
400,12,433,The sea with errors. All the rabid flight
400,12,434,Of winds that ruin ships are bred in night.
400,12,435,"Who is it that can keep off cruel Death,"
400,12,436,If suddenly should rush out th’ angry breath
400,12,437,"Of Notus, or the eager - spirited West,"
400,12,438,"That cuff ships dead, and do the Gods their best?"
400,12,439,"Serve black Night still with shore, meat, sleep, and ease,"
400,12,440,And offer to the Morning for the seas.’
400,12,441,"This all the rest approv’d, and then knew I"
400,12,442,That past all doubt the Devil did apply
400,12,443,His slaught’rous works. Nor would they be withheld;
400,12,444,"I was but one, nor yielded but compell’d."
400,12,445,"But all that might contain them I assay’d,"
400,12,446,"A sacred oath on all their pow’rs I laid,"
400,12,447,That if with herds or any richest - flocks
400,12,448,"We chanc’d t’ encounter, neither sheep nor ox"
400,12,449,"We once should touch, nor (for that constant ill"
400,12,450,"That follows folly) scorn advice and kill,"
400,12,451,But quiet sit us down and take such food
400,12,452,As the immortal Circe had bestow’d.
400,12,453,They swore all this in all severest sort;
400,12,454,And then we anchor’d in the winding port
400,12,455,"Near a fresh river, where the long’d - for shore"
400,12,456,"They all flew out to, took in victuals store,"
400,12,457,"And, being full, thought of their friends, and wept"
400,12,458,"Their loss by Scylla, weeping till they slept."
400,12,459,"In night’s third part, when stars began to stoop,"
400,12,460,The Cloud - assembler put a tempest up.
400,12,461,"A boist’rous spirit he gave it, drave out all"
400,12,462,"His flocks of clouds, and let such darkness fall"
400,12,463,"That Earth and Seas, for fear, to hide were driv’n,"
400,12,464,For with his clouds he thrust out Night from heav’n.
400,12,465,"At morn we drew our ships into a cave,"
400,12,466,In which the Nymphs that Phœbus’ cattle drave
400,12,467,"Fair dancing - rooms had, and their seats of state."
400,12,468,"I urg’d my friends then, that, to shun their fate,"
400,12,469,"They would observe their oath, and take the food"
400,12,470,"Our ship afforded, nor attempt the blood"
400,12,471,"Of those fair herds and flocks, because they were"
400,12,472,The dreadful God’s that all could see and hear.
400,12,473,"They stood observant, and in that good mind"
400,12,474,Had we been gone; but so adverse the wind
400,12,475,"Stood to our passage, that we could not go."
400,12,476,For one whole month perpetually did blow
400,12,477,"Impetuous Notus, not a breath’s repair"
400,12,478,But his and Eurus’ rul’d in all the air.
400,12,479,As long yet as their ruddy wine and bread
400,12,480,"Stood out amongst them, so long not a head"
400,12,481,Of all those oxen fell in any strife
400,12,482,Amongst those students for the gut and life;
400,12,483,"But when their victuals fail’d they fell to prey,"
400,12,484,Necessity compell’d them then to stray
400,12,485,In rape of fish and fowl; whatever came
400,12,486,"In reach of hand or hook, the belly’s flame"
400,12,487,"Afflicted to it. I then fell to pray’r,"
400,12,488,"And (making to a close retreat repair,"
400,12,489,"Free from both friends and winds) I wash’d my hands,"
400,12,490,"And all the Gods besought, that held commands"
400,12,491,"In liberal heav’n, to yield some mean to stay"
400,12,492,"Their desp’rate hunger, and set up the way"
400,12,493,"Of our return restrain’d. The Gods, instead"
400,12,494,Of giving what I pray’d for — pow’r of deed —
400,12,495,"A deedless sleep did on my lids distill,"
400,12,496,For mean to work upon my friends their fill.
400,12,497,"For whiles I slept, there wak’d no mean to curb"
400,12,498,Their headstrong wants; which he that did disturb
400,12,499,"My rule in chief at all times, and was chief"
400,12,500,"To all the rest in counsel to their grief,"
400,12,501,"Knew well, and of my present absence took"
400,12,502,"His fit advantage, and their iron strook"
400,12,503,"At highest heat. For, feeling their desire"
400,12,504,"In his own entrails, to allay the fire"
400,12,505,"That Famine blew in them, he thus gave way"
400,12,506,"To that affection: ‘Hear what I shall say,"
400,12,507,"Though words will staunch no hunger, ev’ry death"
400,12,508,To us poor wretches that draw temporal breath
400,12,509,"You know is hateful; but, all know, to die"
400,12,510,The death of Famine is a misery
400,12,511,"Past all death loathsome. Let us, therefore, take"
400,12,512,"The chief of this fair herd, and off’rings make"
400,12,513,"To all the Deathless that in broad heav’n live,"
400,12,514,"And in particular vow, if we arrive"
400,12,515,"In natural Ithaca, to straight erect"
400,12,516,"A temple to the Haughty - in - aspect,"
400,12,517,"Rich and magnificent, and all within"
400,12,518,Deck it with relics many and divine.
400,12,519,"If yet he stands incens’d, since we have slain"
400,12,520,"His high - brow’d herd, and, therefore, will sustain"
400,12,521,"Desire to wrack our ship, he is but one,"
400,12,522,And all the other Gods that we atone
400,12,523,With our divine rites will their suffrage give
400,12,524,"To our design’d return, and let us live."
400,12,525,"If not, and all take part, I rather crave"
400,12,526,"To serve with one sole death the yawning wave,"
400,12,527,"Than in a desert island lie and sterve,"
400,12,528,And with one pin’d life many deaths observe.’
400,12,529,"All cried ‘He counsels nobly,’ and all speed"
400,12,530,Made to their resolute driving; for the feed
400,12,531,"Of those coal - black, fair, broad - brow’d, sun - lov’d beeves"
400,12,532,Had place close by our ships. They took the lives
400,12,533,"Of sence, most eminent; about their fall"
400,12,534,"Stood round, and to the States Celestial"
400,12,535,Made solemn vows; but other rites their ship
400,12,536,"Could not afford them, they did, therefore, strip"
400,12,537,"The curl’d - head oak of fresh young leaves, to make"
400,12,538,Supply of service for their barley - cake.
400,12,539,"And on the sacredly - enflam’d, for wine,"
400,12,540,"Pour’d purest water, all the parts divine"
400,12,541,Spitting and roasting; all the rites beside
400,12,542,Orderly using. Then did light divide
400,12,543,"My low and upper lids; when, my repair"
400,12,544,"Made near my ship, I met the delicate air"
400,12,545,"Their roast exhal’d; out instantly I cried,"
400,12,546,"And said: ‘O Jove, and all ye Deified,"
400,12,547,"Ye have oppress’d me with a cruel sleep,"
400,12,548,While ye conferr’d on me a loss as deep
400,12,549,As Death descends to. To themselves alone
400,12,550,"My rude men left ungovern’d, they have done"
400,12,551,"A deed so impious, I stand well assur’d,"
400,12,552,That you will not forgive though ye procur’d.’
400,12,553,Then flew Lampetié with the ample robe
400,12,554,"Up to her father with the golden globe,"
400,12,555,Ambassadress t’ inform him that my men
400,12,556,"Had slain his oxen. Heart - incensed then,"
400,12,557,"He cried: ‘Revenge me, Father, and the rest"
400,12,558,Both ever - living and for ever blest!
400,12,559,Ulysses’ impious men have drawn the blood
400,12,560,Of those my oxen that it did me good
400,12,561,"To look on, walking all my starry round,"
400,12,562,And when I trod earth all with meadows crown’d.
400,12,563,"Without your full amends I’ll leave heav’n quite,"
400,12,564,Dis and the dead adorning with my light.’
400,12,565,"The Cloud - herd answer’d: ‘Son! Thou shalt be ours,"
400,12,566,And light those mortals in that mine of flow’rs!
400,12,567,"My red - hot flash shall graze but on their ship,"
400,12,568,"And eat it, burning, in the boiling deep.’"
400,12,569,"This by Calypso I was told, and she"
400,12,570,Inform’d it from the verger Mercury.
400,12,571,"Come to our ship, I chid and told by name"
400,12,572,Each man how impiously he was to blame.
400,12,573,"But chiding got no peace, and beeves were slain!"
400,12,574,When straight the Gods forewent their following pain
400,12,575,With dire ostents. The hides the flesh had lost
400,12,576,"Crept all before them. As the flesh did roast,"
400,12,577,It bellow’d like the ox itself alive.
400,12,578,And yet my soldiers did their dead beeves drive
400,12,579,Through all these prodigies in daily feasts.
400,12,580,Six days they banqueted and slew fresh beasts;
400,12,581,And when the sev’nth day Jove reduc’d the wind
400,12,582,"That all the month rag’d, and so in did bind"
400,12,583,"Our ship and us, was turn’d and calm’d, and we"
400,12,584,"Launch’d, put up masts, sails hoised, and to sea."
400,12,585,The island left so far that land nowhere
400,12,586,"But only sea and sky had pow’r t’ appear,"
400,12,587,"Jove fix’d a cloud above our ship, so black"
400,12,588,That all the sea it darken’d. Yet from wrack
400,12,589,"She ran a good free time, till from the West"
400,12,590,"Came Zephyr ruffling forth, and put his breast"
400,12,591,"Out in a singing tempest, so most vast"
400,12,592,It burst the gables that made sure our mast.
400,12,593,"Our masts came tumbling down, our cattle down"
400,12,594,"Rush’d to the pump, and by our pilot’s crown"
400,12,595,"The main - mast pass’d his fall, pash’d all his skull,"
400,12,596,And all this wrack but one flaw made at full.
400,12,597,"Off from the stern the sternsman diving fell,"
400,12,598,And from his sinews flew his soul to hell.
400,12,599,"Together all this time Jove’s thunder chid,"
400,12,600,"And through and through the ship his lightning glid,"
400,12,601,Till it embrac’d her round; her bulk was fill’d
400,12,602,"With nasty sulphur, and her men were kill’d,"
400,12,603,"Tumbled to sea, like sea - mews swum about,"
400,12,604,And there the date of their return was out.
400,12,605,"I toss’d from side to side still, till all - broke"
400,12,606,"Her ribs were with the storm, and she did choke"
400,12,607,With let - in surges; for the mast torn down
400,12,608,"Tore her up piecemeal, and for me to drown"
400,12,609,Left little undissolv’d. But to the mast
400,12,610,"There was a leather thong left, which I cast"
400,12,611,"About it and the keel, and so sat tost"
400,12,612,"With baneful weather, till the West had lost"
400,12,613,His stormy tyranny. And then arose
400,12,614,"The South, that bred me more abhorréd woes;"
400,12,615,For back again his blasts expell’d me quite
400,12,616,On ravenous Charybdis. All that night
400,12,617,"I totter’d up and down, till Light and I"
400,12,618,"At Scylla’s rock encounter’d, and the nigh"
400,12,619,"Dreadful Charybdis. As I drave on these,"
400,12,620,"I saw Charybdis supping up the seas,"
400,12,621,"And had gone up together, if the tree"
400,12,622,That bore the wild figs had not rescued me;
400,12,623,"To which I leap’d, and left my keel, and high"
400,12,624,Chamb’ring upon it did as close imply
400,12,625,My breast about it as a reremouse could;
400,12,626,Yet might my feet on no stub fasten hold
400,12,627,"To ease my hands, the roots were crept so low"
400,12,628,"Beneath the earth, and so aloft did grow"
400,12,629,"The far - spread arms that, though good height I gat,"
400,12,630,I could not reach them. To the main bole flat
400,12,631,"I, therefore, still must cling; till up again"
400,12,632,"She belch’d my mast, and after that amain"
400,12,633,My keel came tumbling. So at length it chanc’d
400,12,634,"To me, as to a judge that long advanc’d"
400,12,635,"To judge a sort of hot young fellows’ jars,"
400,12,636,"At length time frees him from their civil wars,"
400,12,637,When glad he riseth and to dinner goes;
400,12,638,"So time, at length, releas’d with joys my woes,"
400,12,639,And from Charybdis’ mouth appear’d my keel.
400,12,640,"To which, my hand now loos’d and now my heel,"
400,12,641,"I altogether with a huge noise dropp’d,"
400,12,642,"Just in her midst fell, where the mast was propp’d,"
400,12,643,And there row’d off with owers of my hands.
400,12,644,God and man’s Father would not from her sands
400,12,645,"Let Scylla see me, for I then had died"
400,12,646,That bitter death that my poor friends supplied.
400,12,647,Nine days at sea I hover’d; the tenth night
400,12,648,"In th’ isle Ogygia, where, about the bright"
400,12,649,"And right renown’d Calypso, I was cast"
400,12,650,By pow’r of Deity; where I lived embrac’d
400,12,651,With love and feasts. But why should I relate
400,12,652,Those kind occurrents? I should iterate
400,12,653,What I in part to your chaste queen and you
400,12,654,"So late imparted. And, for me to grow"
400,12,655,"A talker - over of my tale again,"
400,12,656,Were past my free contentment to sustain.”

400,12,660,"[1] _Πέλειαι τρήρωνες. Columbæ timidæ._ What these doves were, and the"
400,12,661,"whole mind of this place, the great Macedon asking Chiron"
400,12,662,"Amphipolites, he answered: They were the Pleiades or seven Stars. One"
400,12,663,"of which (besides his proper imperfection of being _ἀμυδρὸς,_ i.e."
400,12,664,"_adeo exilis, vel subobscurus, ut vix appareat_) is utterly obscured"
400,12,665,"or let by these rocks. Why then, or how, Jove still supplied the lost"
400,12,666,"one, that the number might be full, Athenæus falls to it, and helps"
400,12,667,"the other out, interpreting it to be affirmed of their perpetual"
400,12,668,"septenary number, though there appeared but six. But how lame and"
400,12,669,loathsome these prosers show in their affected expositions of the
400,12,670,"poetical mind, this and an hundred others, spent in mere presumptuous"
400,12,671,"guess at this inaccessible Poet, I hope will make plain enough to the"
400,12,672,"most envious of any thing done, besides their own set censures and"
400,12,673,most arrogant over - weenings. In the 23 of the lliads (being _ψ_) at
400,12,674,"the games celebrated at Patroclus’ funerals, they tied to the top of a"
400,12,675,"mast _πέλειαν τρήρωνα, timidam columbam,_ to shoot at for a game, so"
400,12,676,that (by these great men’s abovesaid expositions) they shot at the
400,12,677,Pleiades.
400,12,678,"[2] _Νηυ̑ς πα̑σι μέλουσα,_ etc. _Navis omnibus curæ: the ship that"
400,12,679,"held the care of all men, or of all things:_ which our critics will"
400,12,680,"needs restrain, _omnibus heroibus, Poetis omnibus, vel Historicis,_"
400,12,681,when the care of all men’s preservation is affirmed to be the freight
400,12,682,"of it; as if poets and historians comprehended all things, when I"
400,12,683,scarce know any that makes them any part of their care. But this
400,12,684,likewise is garbage good enough for the monster. Nor will I tempt our
400,12,685,spiced consciences with expressing the divine mind it includes. Being
400,12,686,"afraid to affirm any good of poor poesy, since no man gets any goods"
400,12,687,by it. And notwithstanding many of our bird - eyed starters at
400,12,688,profanation are for nothing so afraid of it; as that lest their galled
400,12,689,"consciences (scarce believing the most real truth, in approbation of"
400,12,690,"their lives) should be rubbed with the confirmation of it, even in"
400,12,691,these contemned vanities (as their impieties please to call them)
400,12,692,which by much more learned and pious than themselves have ever been
400,12,693,"called the raptures of divine inspiration, by which, _Homo supra"
400,12,694,"humanam naturam erigitur, et in Deum transit._ — Plat."
400,12,695,"[3] _Δεινὸν λελακυι̑α,_ etc. _Graviter vociferans;_ as all most"
400,12,696,untruly translate it. As they do in the next verse these words
400,12,697,"_σκύλακος νεογιλη̑ς catuli leonis,_ no lion being here dreamed of, nor"
400,12,698,"any vociferation. _Δεινὸν λελακυι̑α_ signifying _indignam,"
400,12,699,"dissimilem,_ or _horribilem vocem edens:_ but in what kind"
400,12,700,"_horribilem?_ Not for the gravity or greatness of her voice, but for"
400,12,701,the unworthy or disproportionable small whuling of it; she being in
400,12,702,"the vast frame of her body, as the very words _πέλωρ κακὸν_ signify,"
400,12,703,_monstrum ingens;_ whose disproportion and deformity is too poetically
400,12,704,(and therein elegantly) ordered for fat and flat prosers to
400,12,705,comprehend. Nor could they make the Poet’s words serve their
400,12,706,"comprehension; and therefore they add of their own, _λάσκω,_ from"
400,12,707,"whence _λελακυι̑α_ is derived, signifying _crepo,_ or _stridulê"
400,12,708,"clamo._ And _σκύλακος νεογιλη̑ς_ is to be expounded, _catuli nuper_ or"
400,12,709,"_recens nati,_ not _leonis._ But thus they botch and abuse the"
400,12,710,"incomparable expressor, because they knew not how otherwise to be"
400,12,711,monstrous enough themselves to help out the monster. Imagining so huge
400,12,712,a great body must needs have a voice as huge; and then would not our
400,12,713,"Homer have likened it to a lion’s whelp’s voice, but to the lion’s"
400,12,714,own; and all had been much too little to make a voice answerable to
400,12,715,her hugeness. And therefore found our inimitable master a new way to
400,12,716,"express her monstrous disproportion; performing it so, as there can be"
400,12,717,"_nihil suprâ._ And I would fain learn of my learned detractor, that"
400,12,718,"will needs have me only translate out of the Latin, what Latin"
400,12,719,translation tells me this? Or what Grecian hath ever found this and a
400,12,720,"hundred other such? Which may be some poor instance, or proof, of my"
400,12,721,"Grecian faculty, as far as old Homer goes in his two simple Poems, but"
400,12,722,not a syllable further will my silly spirit presume.
400,13,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,13,2,"Ulysses (shipp’d, but in the even,"
400,13,3,"With all the presents he was given,"
400,13,4,And sleeping then) is set next morn
400,13,5,"In full scope of his wish’d return,"
400,13,6,"And treads unknown his country - shore,"
400,13,7,Whose search so many winters wore.
400,13,8,"The ship (returning, and arriv’d"
400,13,9,Against the city) is depriv’d
400,13,10,"Of form, and, all her motion gone,"
400,13,11,Transform’d by Neptune to a stone.
400,13,12,Ulysses (let to know the strand
400,13,13,Where the Phæacians made him land)
400,13,14,"Consults with Pallas, for the life"
400,13,15,Of ev’ry wooer of his wife.
400,13,16,"His gifts she hides within a cave,"
400,13,17,"And him into a man more grave,"
400,13,18,"All hid in wrinkles, crookéd, gray,"
400,13,19,Transform’d; who so goes on his way.
400,13,20,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,13,21,_Νυ̑._
400,13,22,Phæacia
400,13,23,Ulysses leaves;
400,13,24,"Whom Ithaca,"
400,13,25,"Unwares, receives."
400,13,26,"He said; and silence all their tongues contain’d,"
400,13,27,"In admiration, when with pleasure chain’d"
400,13,28,Their ears had long been to him. At last brake
400,13,29,"Alcinous silence, and in this sort spake"
400,13,30,"To th’ Ithacensian, Laertes’ son:"
400,13,31,“O Ithacus! However over - run
400,13,32,"With former suff’rings in your way for home,"
400,13,33,"Since ’twas, at last, your happy fate to come"
400,13,34,"To my high - roof’d and brass - foundation’d house,"
400,13,35,"I hope, such speed and pass auspicious"
400,13,36,"Our loves shall yield you, that you shall no more"
400,13,37,"Wander, nor suffer, homewards, as before."
400,13,38,"You then, whoever that are ever grac’d"
400,13,39,With all choice of authoriz’d pow’r to taste
400,13,40,"Such wine with me as warms the sacred rage,"
400,13,41,"And is an honorary giv’n to age,[1]"
400,13,42,"With which ye likewise hear divinely sing,"
400,13,43,"In honour’s praise, the poet of the king,"
400,13,44,"I move, by way of my command, to this:"
400,13,45,That where in an elaborate chest there lies
400,13,46,"A present for our guest, attires of price,"
400,13,47,"And gold engrav’n with infinite device,"
400,13,48,I wish that each of us should add beside
400,13,49,"A tripod, and a caldron, amplified"
400,13,50,"With size, and metal of most rate, and great;"
400,13,51,"For we, in council of taxation met,"
400,13,52,Will from our subjects gain their worth again;
400,13,53,Since ’tis unequal one man should sustain
400,13,54,"A charge so weighty, being the grace of all,"
400,13,55,Which borne by many is a weight but small.”
400,13,56,"Thus spake Alcinous, and pleas’d the rest;"
400,13,57,When each man clos’d with home and sleep his feast.
400,13,58,"But when the colour - giving light arose,"
400,13,59,"All to the ship did all their speeds dispose,[2]"
400,13,60,"And wealth, that honest men makes, brought with them.[3]"
400,13,61,All which ev’n he that wore the diadem
400,13,62,"Stow’d in the ship himself, beneath the seats"
400,13,63,"The rowers sat in, stooping, lest their lets"
400,13,64,In any of their labours he might prove.
400,13,65,"Then home he turn’d, and after him did move"
400,13,66,The whole assembly to expected feast.
400,13,67,"Among whom he a sacrifice addrest,"
400,13,68,"And slew an ox, to weather - wielding Jove,"
400,13,69,"Beneath whose empire all things are, and move."
400,13,70,"The thighs then roasting, they made glorious cheer"
400,13,71,Delighted highly; and amongst them there
400,13,72,"The honour’d - of - the - people us’d his voice,"
400,13,73,"Divine Demodocus. Yet, through this choice"
400,13,74,"Of cheer and music, had Ulysses still"
400,13,75,"An eye directed to the Eastern hill,"
400,13,76,To see Him rising that illustrates all;
400,13,77,For now into his mind a fire did fall
400,13,78,Of thirst for home. And as in hungry vow
400,13,79,To needful food a man at fixéd plow
400,13,80,(To whom the black ox all day long hath turn’d
400,13,81,"The stubborn fallows up, his stomach burn’d"
400,13,82,"With empty heat and appetite to food,"
400,13,83,His knees afflicted with his spirit - spent blood)
400,13,84,"At length the long - expected sunset sees,"
400,13,85,"That he may sit to food, and rest his knees;"
400,13,86,So to Ulysses set the friendly light
400,13,87,"The sun afforded, with as wish’d a sight."
400,13,88,"Who straight bespake that oar - affecting State,"
400,13,89,But did in chief his speech appropriate
400,13,90,"To him by name, that with their rule was crown’d."
400,13,91,"“Alcinous, of all men most renown’d,"
400,13,92,Dismiss me with as safe pass as you vow
400,13,93,(Your off’ring past) and may the Gods to you
400,13,94,In all contentment use as full a hand;
400,13,95,For now my landing here and stay shall stand
400,13,96,"In all perfection with my heart’s desire,"
400,13,97,"Both my so safe deduction to aspire,"
400,13,98,And loving gifts; which may the Gods to me
400,13,99,"As blest in use make as your acts are free,"
400,13,100,"Ev’n to the finding firm in love, and life,"
400,13,101,"With all desir’d event, my friends, and wife."
400,13,102,"When, as myself shall live delighted there,"
400,13,103,"May you with your wives rest as happy here,"
400,13,104,"Your sons and daughters, in particular state,"
400,13,105,With ev’ry virtue render’d consummate;
400,13,106,"And, in your gen’ral empire, may ill never"
400,13,107,"Approach your land, but good your good quit ever.”"
400,13,108,"This all applauded, and all jointly cried:"
400,13,109,“Dismiss the stranger! He hath dignified
400,13,110,With fit speech his dismission.” Then the king
400,13,111,Thus charg’d the herald: “Fill for offering
400,13,112,A bowl of wine; which through the whole large house
400,13,113,"Dispose to all men, that, propitious"
400,13,114,"Our father Jove made with our pray’rs, we may"
400,13,115,Give home our guest in full and wishéd way.”
400,13,116,"This said, Pontonous commix’d a bowl"
400,13,117,Of such sweet wine as did delight the soul.
400,13,118,"Which making sacred to the blessed Gods,"
400,13,119,"That hold in broad heav’n their supreme abodes,"
400,13,120,"God - like Ulysses from his chair arose,"
400,13,121,And in the hands of th’ empress did impose
400,13,122,"The all - round cup; to whom, fair spoke, he said:"
400,13,123,"“Rejoice, O queen, and be your joys repaid"
400,13,124,"By heav’n, for me, till age and death succeed;"
400,13,125,Both which inflict their most unwelcome need
400,13,126,"On men and dames alike. And, first, for me,"
400,13,127,"I must from hence, to both: Live you here free,"
400,13,128,"And ever may all living blessings spring,"
400,13,129,"Your joy in children, subjects, and your king.”"
400,13,130,"This said, divine Ulysses took his way;"
400,13,131,Before whom the unalterable sway
400,13,132,Of king Alcinous’ virtue did command
400,13,133,"A herald’s fit attendance to the strand,"
400,13,134,And ship appointed. With him likewise went
400,13,135,"Handmaids, by Arete’s injunction sent."
400,13,136,"One bore an out and in - weed, fair and sweet,"
400,13,137,"The other an embroider’d cabinet,"
400,13,138,"The third had bread to bear, and ruddy wine;"
400,13,139,"All which, at sea and ship arriv’d, resign"
400,13,140,"Their freight conferr’d. With fair attendants then,"
400,13,141,"The sheets and bedding of the man of men,"
400,13,142,"Within a cabin of the hollow keel,"
400,13,143,"Spread, and made soft, that sleep might sweetly seel"
400,13,144,"His restful eyes, he enter’d, and his bed"
400,13,145,In silence took. The rowers orderéd
400,13,146,"Themselves in sev’ral seats, and then set gone"
400,13,147,"The ship, the gable from the hollow stone"
400,13,148,"Dissolv’d and weigh’d - up, all, together, close"
400,13,149,Then beat the sea. His lids in sweet repose
400,13,150,"Sleep bound so fast, it scarce gave way to breath"
400,13,151,"Inexcitable, most dear, next of all to death."
400,13,152,And as amids a fair field four brave horse
400,13,153,Before a chariot stung into their course
400,13,154,"With fervent lashes of the smarting scourge,"
400,13,155,"That all their fire blows high, and makes them urge"
400,13,156,To utmost speed the measure of their ground;
400,13,157,So bore the ship aloft her fiery bound;
400,13,158,"About whom rush’d the billows black and vast,"
400,13,159,In which the sea - roars burst. As firm as fast
400,13,160,She ply’d her course yet; nor her wingéd speed
400,13,161,The falcon - gentle could for pace exceed;
400,13,162,"So cut she through the waves, and bore a man"
400,13,163,"Even with the Gods in counsels, that began"
400,13,164,"And spent his former life in all misease,"
400,13,165,"Battles of men, and rude waves of the seas,"
400,13,166,"Yet now securely slept, forgetting all."
400,13,167,"And when heav’n’s brightest star, that first doth call"
400,13,168,"The early morning out, advanc’d her head,"
400,13,169,Then near to Ithaca the billow - bred
400,13,170,"Phræcian ship approach’d. There is a port,"
400,13,171,"That th’ aged sea - God Phorcys makes his fort,"
400,13,172,"Whose earth the Ithacensian people own,"
400,13,173,In which two rocks inaccessible are grown
400,13,174,"Far forth into the sea, whose each strength binds"
400,13,175,The boist’rous waves in from the high - flown winds
400,13,176,"On both the out - parts so, that all within"
400,13,177,"The well - built ships, that once their harbour win"
400,13,178,"In his calm bosom, without anchor rest,"
400,13,179,"Safe, and unstirr’d. From forth the haven’s high crest"
400,13,180,Branch the well - brawn’d arms of an olive - tree;
400,13,181,"Beneath which runs a cave from all sun free,"
400,13,182,"Cool, and delightsome, sacred to th’ access"
400,13,183,Of Nymphs whose surnames are the Naiadés;
400,13,184,"In which flew humming bees, in which lay thrown"
400,13,185,"Stone cups, stone vessels, shittles all of stone,"
400,13,186,"With which the Nymphs their purple mantles wove,"
400,13,187,In whose contexture art and wonder strove;
400,13,188,In which pure springs perpetually ran;
400,13,189,"To which two entries were; the one for man,"
400,13,190,"On which the North breath’d; th’ other for the Gods,"
400,13,191,On which the South; and that bore no abodes
400,13,192,"For earthy men, but only deathless feet"
400,13,193,Had there free way. This port these men thought meet
400,13,194,"To land Ulysses, being the first they knew,"
400,13,195,"Drew then their ship in, but no further drew"
400,13,196,"Than half her bulk reach’d, by such cunning hand"
400,13,197,"Her course was manag’d. Then her men took land,"
400,13,198,"And first brought forth Ulysses, bed, and all"
400,13,199,"That richly furnish’d it, he still in thrall"
400,13,200,Of all - subduing sleep. Upon the sand
400,13,201,They set him softly down; and then the strand
400,13,202,"They strew’d with all the goods he had, bestow’d"
400,13,203,"By the renown’d Phæacians, since he show’d"
400,13,204,So much Minerva. At the olive root
400,13,205,"They drew them then in heap, most far from foot"
400,13,206,"Of any traveller, lest, ere his eyes"
400,13,207,"Resum’d their charge, they might be others’ prise."
400,13,208,These then turn’d home; nor was the sea’s Supreme
400,13,209,"Forgetful of his threats, for Polypheme"
400,13,210,"Bent at divine Ulysses, yet would prove"
400,13,211,(Ere their performance) the decree of Jove.
400,13,212,"“Father! no more the Gods shall honour me,"
400,13,213,"Since men despise me, and those men that see"
400,13,214,The light in lineage of mine own lov’d race.[4]
400,13,215,"I vow’d Ulysses should, before the grace"
400,13,216,"Of his return, encounter woes enow"
400,13,217,To make that purchase dear; yet did not vow
400,13,218,"Simply against it, since thy brow had bent"
400,13,219,"To his reduction, in the fore - consent"
400,13,220,"Thou hadst vouchsaf’d it; yet, before my mind"
400,13,221,"Hath full pow’r on him, the Phæacians find"
400,13,222,"Their own minds’ satisfaction with his pass,"
400,13,223,"So far from suff’ring what my pleasure was,"
400,13,224,That ease and softness now is habited
400,13,225,"In his secure breast, and his careless head"
400,13,226,"Return’d in peace of sleep to Ithaca,"
400,13,227,The brass and gold of rich Phæacia
400,13,228,"Rocking his temples, garments richly wov’n,"
400,13,229,"And worlds of prise, more than was ever strov’n"
400,13,230,"From all the conflicts he sustain’d at Troy,"
400,13,231,If safe he should his full share there enjoy.”
400,13,232,The Show’r - dissolver answer’d: “What a speech
400,13,233,"Hath pass’d thy palate, O thou great in reach"
400,13,234,Of wrackful empire! Far the Gods remain
400,13,235,"From scorn of thee, for ’twere a work of pain"
400,13,236,To prosecute with ignominies one
400,13,237,That sways our ablest and most ancient throne.
400,13,238,"For men, if any so beneath in pow’r"
400,13,239,"Neglect thy high will, now, or any hour"
400,13,240,"That moves hereafter, take revenge to thee,"
400,13,241,"Soothe all thy will, and be thy pleasure free.”"
400,13,242,"“Why then,” said he, “thou blacker of the fumes"
400,13,243,"That dim the sun, my licens’d pow’r resumes"
400,13,244,Act from thy speech; but I observe so much
400,13,245,"And fear thy pleasure, that, I dare not touch"
400,13,246,"At any inclination of mine own,"
400,13,247,Till thy consenting influence be known.
400,13,248,"But now this curious - built Phæacian ship,"
400,13,249,"Returning from her convoy, I will strip"
400,13,250,"Of all her fleeting matter, and to stone"
400,13,251,"Transform and fix it, just when she hath gone"
400,13,252,"Her full time home, and jets before their prease"
400,13,253,"In all her trim, amids the sable seas,"
400,13,254,"That they may cease to convoy strangers still,"
400,13,255,When they shall see so like a mighty hill
400,13,256,"Their glory stick before their city’s grace,"
400,13,257,And my hands cast a mask before her face.”[5]
400,13,258,"“O friend,” said Jove, “it shows to me the best"
400,13,259,"Of all earth’s objects, that their whole prease, drest"
400,13,260,"In all their wonder, near their town shall stand,"
400,13,261,"And stare upon a stone, so near the land,"
400,13,262,"So like a ship, and dam up all their lights,"
400,13,263,As if a mountain interpos’d their sights.”
400,13,264,"When Neptune heard this, he for Scheria went,"
400,13,265,Whence the Phæacians took their first descent.
400,13,266,"Which when he reach’d, and, in her swiftest pride,"
400,13,267,The water - treader by the city’s side
400,13,268,"Came cutting close, close he came swiftly on,"
400,13,269,"Took her in violent hand, and to a stone"
400,13,270,Turn’d all her sylvan substance; all below
400,13,271,"Firm’d her with roots, and left her. This strange show"
400,13,272,"When the Phæacians saw, they stupid stood,"
400,13,273,"And ask’d each other, who amids the flood"
400,13,274,"Could fix their ship so in her full speed home,"
400,13,275,And quite transparent make her bulk become?
400,13,276,Thus talk’d they; but were far from knowing how
400,13,277,"These things had issue. Which their king did show,"
400,13,278,"And said: “O friends, the ancient prophecies"
400,13,279,"My father told to me, to all our eyes"
400,13,280,"Are now in proof. He said, the time would come,"
400,13,281,"When Neptune, for our safe conducting home"
400,13,282,"All sorts of strangers, out of envy fir’d,"
400,13,283,"Would meet our fairest ship as she retir’d,"
400,13,284,And all the goodly shape and speed we boast
400,13,285,Should like a mountain stand before us lost
400,13,286,Amids the moving waters; which we see
400,13,287,Perform’d in full end to our prophecy.
400,13,288,"Hear then my counsel, and obey me then:"
400,13,289,"Renounce henceforth our convoy home of men,"
400,13,290,Whoever shall hereafter greet our town;
400,13,291,And to th’ offended Deity’s renown
400,13,292,"Twelve chosen oxen let us sacred make,"
400,13,293,"That he may pity us, and from us take"
400,13,294,"This shady mountain. They, in fear, obey’d,"
400,13,295,"Slew all the beeves, and to the Godhead pray’d,"
400,13,296,The dukes and princes all ensphering round
400,13,297,"The sacred altar; while whose tops were crown’d,"
400,13,298,"Divine Ulysses, on his country’s breast"
400,13,299,"Laid bound in sleep, now rose out of his rest,"
400,13,300,Nor (being so long remov’d) the region knew.
400,13,301,"Besides which absence yet, Minerva threw"
400,13,302,"A cloud about him, to make strange the more"
400,13,303,"His safe arrival, lest upon his shore"
400,13,304,"He should make known his face, and utter all"
400,13,305,That might prevent th’ event that was to fall.
400,13,306,"Which she prepar’d so well, that not his wife,"
400,13,307,"Presented to him, should perceive his life,"
400,13,308,"No citizen, no friend, till righteous fate"
400,13,309,Upon the Wooer’s wrongs were consummate.
400,13,310,Through which cloud all things show’d now to the king
400,13,311,Of foreign fashion; the enflow’réd spring
400,13,312,"Amongst the trees there, the perpetual waves,"
400,13,313,"The rocks, that did more high their foreheads raise"
400,13,314,"To his wrapt eye than naturally they did,"
400,13,315,"And all the haven, in which a man seem’d hid"
400,13,316,"From wind and weather, when storms loudest chid."
400,13,317,"He therefore, being risen, stood and view’d"
400,13,318,"His country - earth; which, not perceiv’d, he rued,"
400,13,319,"And, striking with his hurl’d - down hands his thighs,"
400,13,320,"He mourn’d, and said: “O me! Again where lies"
400,13,321,"My desert way? To wrongful men and rude,"
400,13,322,And with no laws of human right endued?
400,13,323,"Or are they human, and of holy minds?"
400,13,324,What fits my deed with these so many kinds
400,13,325,Of goods late giv’n? What with myself will floods
400,13,326,"And errors do? I would to God, these goods"
400,13,327,"Had rested with their owners, and that I"
400,13,328,"Had fall’n on kings of more regality,"
400,13,329,"To grace out my return, that lov’d indeed,"
400,13,330,And would have giv’n me consorts of fit speed
400,13,331,"To my distresses’ ending! But, as now"
400,13,332,All knowledge flies me where I may bestow
400,13,333,"My labour’d purchase, here they shall not stay,"
400,13,334,Lest what I car’d for others make their prey.
400,13,335,O Gods! I see the great Phæacians then
400,13,336,"Were not all just and understanding men,"
400,13,337,"That land me elsewhere than their vaunts pretended,"
400,13,338,Assuring me my country should see ended
400,13,339,"My miseries told them, yet now eat their vaunts."
400,13,340,"O Jove! Great Guardian of poor suppliants,"
400,13,341,"That others sees, and notes too, shutting in"
400,13,342,"All in thy plagues that most presume on sin,"
400,13,343,Revenge me on them. Let me number now
400,13,344,"The goods they gave, to give my mind to know"
400,13,345,If they have stol’n none in their close retreat.”
400,13,346,"The goodly caldrons then, and tripods, set"
400,13,347,"In sev’ral ranks from out the heap, he told,"
400,13,348,"His rich wrought garments too, and all his gold,"
400,13,349,And nothing lack’d; and yet this man did mourn
400,13,350,"The but suppos’d miss of his home - return,"
400,13,351,And creeping to the shore with much complaint;
400,13,352,"Minerva (like a shepherd, young, and quaint,[6]"
400,13,353,"As king sons are, a double mantle cast"
400,13,354,"Athwart his shoulders, his fair goers grac’d"
400,13,355,"With fitted shoes, and in his hand a dart)"
400,13,356,"Appear’d to him, whose sight rejoic’d his heart,"
400,13,357,"To whom he came, and said: “O friend! Since first"
400,13,358,"I meet your sight here, be all good the worst"
400,13,359,"That can join our encounter. Fare you fair,"
400,13,360,"Nor with adverse mind welcome my repair,"
400,13,361,"But guard these goods of mine, and succour me."
400,13,362,"As to a God I offer pray’rs to thee,"
400,13,363,And low access make to thy lovéd knee.
400,13,364,"Say truth, that I may know, what country then,"
400,13,365,"What common people live here, and what men?"
400,13,366,"Some famous isle is this? Or gives it vent,"
400,13,367,"Being near the sea, to some rich continent?”"
400,13,368,"She answer’d: “Stranger, whatsoe’er you are,"
400,13,369,"Y’are either foolish, or come passing far,"
400,13,370,"That know not this isle, and make that doubt trouble,"
400,13,371,"For ’tis not so exceedingly ignoble,"
400,13,372,"But passing many know it; and so many,"
400,13,373,"That of all nations there abides not any,"
400,13,374,"From where the morning rises and the sun,"
400,13,375,"To where the even and night their courses run,"
400,13,376,"But know this country. Rocky ’tis, and rough,"
400,13,377,"And so for use of horse unapt enough,"
400,13,378,"Yet with sad barrenness not much infested,[7]"
400,13,379,"Since clouds are here in frequent rains digested,"
400,13,380,"And flow’ry dews. The compass is not great,"
400,13,381,The little yet well - fill’d with wine and wheat.
400,13,382,"It feeds a goat and ox well, being still"
400,13,383,"Water’d with floods, that ever over - fill"
400,13,384,"With heav’n’s continual show’rs; and wooded so,"
400,13,385,It makes a spring of all the kinds that grow.
400,13,386,"And therefore, Stranger, the extended name"
400,13,387,Of this dominion makes access by fame
400,13,388,From this extreme part of Achaia
400,13,389,"As far as Ilion, and ’tis Ithaca.”"
400,13,390,"This joy’d him much, that so unknown a land"
400,13,391,Turn’d to his country. Yet so wise a hand
400,13,392,"He carried, ev’n of this joy, flown so high,"
400,13,393,That other end he put to his reply
400,13,394,"Than straight to show that joy, and lay abroad"
400,13,395,His life to strangers. Therefore he bestow’d
400,13,396,A veil on truth; for evermore did wind
400,13,397,"About his bosom a most crafty mind,"
400,13,398,"Which thus his words show’d: “I have far at sea,"
400,13,399,"In spacious Crete, heard speak of Ithaca,"
400,13,400,"Of which myself, it seems, now reach the shore,"
400,13,401,With these my fortunes; whose whole value more
400,13,402,"I left in Crete amongst my children there,"
400,13,403,From whence I fly for being the slaughterer
400,13,404,"Of royal Idomen’s most - lovéd son,"
400,13,405,"Swift - foot Orsilochus, that could out - run"
400,13,406,"Profess’d men for the race. Yet him I slew,"
400,13,407,Because he would deprive me of my due
400,13,408,In Trojan prise; for which I suffer’d so
400,13,409,(The rude waves piercing) the redoubled woe
400,13,410,Of mind and body in the wars of men.
400,13,411,Nor did I gratify his father then
400,13,412,"With any service, but, as well as he"
400,13,413,"Sway’d in command of other soldiery,"
400,13,414,"So, with a friend withdrawn, we waylaid him,"
400,13,415,"When gloomy night the cope of heav’n did dim,"
400,13,416,"And no man knew; but, we lodg’d close, he came,"
400,13,417,And I put out to him his vital flame.
400,13,418,"Whose slaughter having author’d with my sword,"
400,13,419,"I instant flight made, and straight fell aboard"
400,13,420,A ship of the renown’d Phœnician state;
400,13,421,"When pray’r, and pay at a sufficient rate,"
400,13,422,Obtain’d my pass of men in her command;
400,13,423,Whom I enjoin’d to set me on the land
400,13,424,"Of Pylos, or of Elis the divine,"
400,13,425,Where the Epeïans in great empire shine.
400,13,426,"But force of weather check’d that course to them,"
400,13,427,Though (loth to fail me) to their most extreme
400,13,428,"They spent their willing pow’rs. But, forc’d from thence,"
400,13,429,"We err’d, and put in here, with much expence"
400,13,430,"Of care and labour; and in dead of night,"
400,13,431,When no man there serv’d any appetite
400,13,432,"So much as with the memory of food,"
400,13,433,Though our estates exceeding needy stood.
400,13,434,"But, going ashore, we lay; when gentle sleep"
400,13,435,"My weary pow’rs invaded, and from ship"
400,13,436,"They fetching these my riches, with just hand"
400,13,437,"About me laid them, while upon the sand"
400,13,438,Sleep bound my senses; and for Sidon they
400,13,439,"(Put off from hence) made sail, while here I lay,"
400,13,440,"Left sad alone.” The Goddess laugh’d, and took"
400,13,441,"His hand in hers, and with another look"
400,13,442,"(Assuming then the likeness of a dame,"
400,13,443,"Lovely and goodly, expert in the frame"
400,13,444,Of virtuous housewif’ries) she answer’d thus:
400,13,445,"“He should be passing - sly, and covetous"
400,13,446,"Of stealth, in men’s deceits, that coted thee[8]"
400,13,447,"In any craft, though any God should be"
400,13,448,Ambitious to exceed in subtilty.
400,13,449,Thou still - wit - varying wretch! Insatiate[9]
400,13,450,In over - reaches! Not secure thy state
400,13,451,"Without these wiles, though on thy native shore"
400,13,452,"Thou sett’st safe footing, but upon thy store"
400,13,453,"Of false words still spend, that ev’n from thy birth"
400,13,454,"Have been thy best friends? Come, our either worth"
400,13,455,"Is known to either. Thou of men art far,"
400,13,456,"For words and counsels, the most singular,"
400,13,457,But I above the Gods in both may boast
400,13,458,My still - tried faculties. Yet thou hast lost
400,13,459,"The knowledge ev’n of me, the Seed of Jove,"
400,13,460,"Pallas Athenia, that have still out - strove"
400,13,461,"In all thy labours their extremes, and stood"
400,13,462,"Thy sure guard ever, making all thy good"
400,13,463,"Known to the good Phæacians, and receiv’d."
400,13,464,"And now again I greet thee, to see weav’d"
400,13,465,"Fresh counsels for thee, and will take on me"
400,13,466,"The close reserving of these goods for thee,"
400,13,467,Which the renown’d Phæacian states bestow’d
400,13,468,"At thy deduction homewards, only mov’d"
400,13,469,With my both spirit and counsel. All which grace
400,13,470,"I now will amplify, and tell what case"
400,13,471,"Thy household stands in, utt’ring all those pains"
400,13,472,That of mere need yet still must wrack thy veins.
400,13,473,"Do thou then freely bear, nor one word give"
400,13,474,"To man nor dame to show thou yet dost live,"
400,13,475,But silent suffer over all again
400,13,476,"Thy sorrows past, and bear the wrongs of men.”"
400,13,477,"“Goddess,” said he, “unjust men, and unwise,"
400,13,478,"That author injuries and vanities,"
400,13,479,By vanities and wrongs should rather be
400,13,480,"Bound to this ill - abearing destiny,"
400,13,481,"Than just and wise men. What delight hath heav’n,"
400,13,482,"That lives unhurt itself, to suffer giv’n"
400,13,483,Up to all domage those poor few that strive
400,13,484,"To imitate it, and like the Deities live?"
400,13,485,But where you wonder that I know you not
400,13,486,"Through all your changes, that skill is not got"
400,13,487,"By sleight or art, since thy most hard - hit face"
400,13,488,Is still distinguish’d by thy free - giv’n grace;
400,13,489,"And therefore, truly to acknowledge thee"
400,13,490,"In thy encounters, is a mastery"
400,13,491,In men most - knowing; for to all men thou
400,13,492,Tak’st sev’ral likeness. All men think they know
400,13,493,"Thee in their wits; but, since thy seeming view"
400,13,494,"Appears to all, and yet thy truth to few,"
400,13,495,Through all thy changes to discern thee right
400,13,496,"Asks chief love to thee, and inspiréd light."
400,13,497,"But this I surely know, that, some years past,"
400,13,498,"I have been often with thy presence grac’d,"
400,13,499,All time the sons of Greece wag’d war at Troy;
400,13,500,But when Fate’s full hour let our swords enjoy
400,13,501,"Our vows in sack of Priam’s lofty town,"
400,13,502,"Our ships all boarded, and when God had blown"
400,13,503,"Our fleet in sunder, I could never see"
400,13,504,"The Seed of Jove, nor once distinguish thee"
400,13,505,"Boarding my ship, to take one woe from me."
400,13,506,"But only in my proper spirit involv’d,"
400,13,507,"Err’d here and there, quite slain, till heav’n dissolv’d"
400,13,508,"Me, and my ill; which chanc’d not, till thy grace"
400,13,509,"By open speech confirm’d me, in a place"
400,13,510,"Fruitful of people, where, in person, thou"
400,13,511,"Didst give me guide, and all their city show;"
400,13,512,And that was the renown’d Phæacian earth.
400,13,513,"Now then, ev’n by the Author of thy birth,"
400,13,514,Vouchsafe my doubt the truth (for far it flies
400,13,515,My thoughts that thus should fall into mine eyes
400,13,516,"Conspicuous Ithaca, but fear I touch"
400,13,517,"At some far shore, and that thy wit is such"
400,13,518,Thou dost delude me) is it sure the same
400,13,519,Most honour’d earth that bears my country’s name?”
400,13,520,"“I see,” said she, “thou wilt be ever thus"
400,13,521,"In ev’ry worldly good incredulous,"
400,13,522,And therefore have no more the pow’r to see
400,13,523,Frail life more plagued with infelicity
400,13,524,"In one so eloquent, ingenious, wise."
400,13,525,"Another man, that so long miseries"
400,13,526,"Had kept from his lov’d home, and thus return’d"
400,13,527,"To see his house, wife, children, would have burn’d"
400,13,528,In headlong lust to visit. Yet t’ inquire
400,13,529,"What states they hold, affects not thy desire,"
400,13,530,Till thou hast tried if in thy wife there be
400,13,531,A sorrow wasting days and nights for thee
400,13,532,"In loving tears, that then the sight may prove"
400,13,533,A full reward for either’s mutual love.
400,13,534,But I would never credit in you both
400,13,535,"Least cause of sorrow, but well knew the troth"
400,13,536,"Of this thine own return, though all thy friends,"
400,13,537,"I knew as well, should make returnless ends;"
400,13,538,Yet would not cross mine uncle Neptune so
400,13,539,"To stand their safeguard, since so high did go"
400,13,540,His wrath for thy extinction of the eye
400,13,541,"Of his lov’d son. Come then, I’ll show thee why"
400,13,542,"I call this isle thy Ithaca, to ground"
400,13,543,Thy credit on my words: This haven is own’d
400,13,544,"By th’ agéd sea - god Phorcys, in whose brow"
400,13,545,"This is the olive with the ample bough,"
400,13,546,"And here, close by, the pleasant - shaded cave"
400,13,547,"That to the Fount - Nymphs th’ Ithacensians gave,"
400,13,548,As sacred to their pleasures. Here doth run
400,13,549,"The large and cover’d den, where thou hast done"
400,13,550,"Hundreds of off’rings to the Naiades,"
400,13,551,Here Mount Neritus shakes his curléd tress
400,13,552,"Of shady woods.” This said, she clear’d the cloud"
400,13,553,That first deceiv’d his eyes; and all things show’d
400,13,554,His country to him. Glad he stood with sight
400,13,555,"Of his lov’d soil, and kiss’d it with delight;"
400,13,556,And instantly to all the Nymphs he paid
400,13,557,"(With hands held up to heav’n) these vows, and said:"
400,13,558,"“Ye Nymphs the Naiades, great Seed of Jove,"
400,13,559,I had conceit that never more should move
400,13,560,"Your sight in these spheres of my erring eyes,"
400,13,561,"And therefore, in the fuller sacrifice"
400,13,562,"Of my heart’s gratitude, rejoice, till more"
400,13,563,I pay your names in off’rings as before;
400,13,564,"Which here I vow, if Jove’s benign descent,"
400,13,565,"The mighty Pillager, with life convent"
400,13,566,"My person home, and to my sav’d decease"
400,13,567,Of my lov’d son’s sight add the sweet increase.”
400,13,568,"“Be confident,” said Pallas, “nor oppress"
400,13,569,"Thy spirits with care of these performances,"
400,13,570,But these thy fortunes let us straight repose
400,13,571,"In this divine cave’s bosom, that may close"
400,13,572,Reserve their value; and we then may see
400,13,573,How best to order other acts to thee.”
400,13,574,"Thus enter’d she the light - excluding cave,"
400,13,575,And through it sought some inmost nook to save
400,13,576,"The gold, the great brass, and robes richly - wrought,"
400,13,577,"Giv’n to Ulysses. All which in he brought,"
400,13,578,Laid down in heap; and she impos’d a stone
400,13,579,Close to the cavern’s mouth. Then sat they on
400,13,580,"The sacred olive’s root, consulting how"
400,13,581,To act th’ insulting Wooers’ overthrow;
400,13,582,When Pallas said: “Examine now the means
400,13,583,That best may lay hands on the impudence
400,13,584,"Of those proud Wooers, that have now three years"
400,13,585,"Thy roof’s rule sway’d, and been bold offerers"
400,13,586,"Of suit and gifts to thy renownéd wife,"
400,13,587,Who for thy absence all her desolate life
400,13,588,Dissolves in tears till thy desir’d return;
400,13,589,"Yet all her Wooers, while she thus doth mourn,"
400,13,590,"She holds in hope, and ev’ry one affords"
400,13,591,(In fore - sent message) promise; but her words
400,13,592,Bear other utt’rance than her heart approves.”
400,13,593,"“O Gods,” said Ithacus, “it now behoves"
400,13,594,My fate to end me in the ill decease
400,13,595,"That Agamemnon underwent, unless"
400,13,596,"You tell me, and in time; their close intents."
400,13,597,Advise then means to the reveng’d events
400,13,598,We both resolve on. Be thyself so kind
400,13,599,"To stand close to me, and but such a mind"
400,13,600,"Breathe in my bosom, as when th’ Ilion tow’rs"
400,13,601,We tore in cinders. O if equal pow’rs
400,13,602,"Thou wouldst enflame amidst my nerves as then,"
400,13,603,"I could encounter with three hundred men,"
400,13,604,"Thy only self, great Goddess, had to friend,"
400,13,605,In those brave ardors thou wert wont t’ extend!”
400,13,606,"“I will be strongly with thee,” answer’d she,"
400,13,607,"“Nor must thou fail, but do thy part with me."
400,13,608,"When both whose pow’rs combine, I hope the bloods"
400,13,609,And brains of some of these that waste thy goods
400,13,610,Shall strew thy goodly pavements. Join we then:
400,13,611,"I first will render thee unknown to men,"
400,13,612,And on thy solid lineaments make dry
400,13,613,Thy now smooth skin; thy bright - brown curls imply
400,13,614,In hoary mattings; thy broad shoulders clothe
400,13,615,In such a cloak as ev’ry eye shall lothe;
400,13,616,Thy bright eyes blear and wrinkle; and so change
400,13,617,"Thy form at all parts, that thou shalt be strange"
400,13,618,"To all the Wooers, thy young son, and wife."
400,13,619,"But to thy herdsman first present thy life,"
400,13,620,"That guards thy swine, and wisheth well to thee,"
400,13,621,That loves thy son and wife Penelopé.
400,13,622,"Thy search shall find him set aside his herd,"
400,13,623,"That are with taste - delighting acorns rear’d,"
400,13,624,"And drink the dark - deep water of the spring,"
400,13,625,"Bright Arethusa, the most nourishing"
400,13,626,"Raiser of herds. There stay, and, taking seat"
400,13,627,"Aside thy herdsman, of the whole state treat"
400,13,628,"Of home - occurrents, while I make access"
400,13,629,To fair - dame - breeding Sparta for regress
400,13,630,"Of lov’d Telemachus, who went in quest"
400,13,631,"Of thy lov’d fame, and liv’d the welcome guest"
400,13,632,Of Menelaus.” The much - knower said:
400,13,633,"“Why wouldst not thou, in whose grave breast is bred"
400,13,634,"The art to order all acts, tell in this"
400,13,635,His error to him? Let those years of his
400,13,636,"Amids the rude seas wander, and sustain"
400,13,637,"The woes there raging, while unworthy men"
400,13,638,Devour his fortunes?” “Let not care extend
400,13,639,"Thy heart for him,” said she, “myself did send"
400,13,640,"His person in thy search; to set his worth,"
400,13,641,"By good fame blown, to such a distance forth."
400,13,642,Nor suffers he in any least degree
400,13,643,"The grief you fear, but all variety"
400,13,644,"That Plenty can yield in her quiet’st fare,"
400,13,645,"In Menelaus’ court, doth sit and share."
400,13,646,"In whose return from home, the Wooers yet"
400,13,647,"Lay bloody ambush, and a ship have set"
400,13,648,"To sea, to intercept his life before"
400,13,649,He touch again his birth’s attempted shore.
400,13,650,"All which, my thoughts say, they shall never do,"
400,13,651,"But rather, that the earth shall overgo"
400,13,652,"Some one at least of these love - making men,"
400,13,653,By which thy goods so much impair sustain.”
400,13,654,"Thus using certain secret words to him,"
400,13,655,She touch’d him with her rod; and ev’ry limb
400,13,656,Was hid all - over with a wither’d skin;
400,13,657,His bright eyes blear’d; his brow - curls white and thin;
400,13,658,And all things did an agéd man present.
400,13,659,"Then, for his own weeds, shirt and coat, all - rent,"
400,13,660,"Tann’d, and all - sootiéd with noisome smoke,"
400,13,661,"She put him on; and, over all, a cloke"
400,13,662,"Made of a stag’s huge hide, of which was worn"
400,13,663,"The hair quite off; a scrip, all - patch’d and torn,"
400,13,664,"Hung by a cord, oft broke and knit again;"
400,13,665,And with a staff did his old limbs sustain.
400,13,666,"Thus having both consulted of th’ event,"
400,13,667,They parted both; and forth to Sparta went
400,13,668,"The gray - eyed Goddess, to see all things done"
400,13,669,That appertain’d to wise Ulysses’ son.

400,14,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,14,2,Ulysses meets amids the field
400,14,3,His swain Eumæus: who doth yield
400,14,4,"Kind guest - rites to him, and relate"
400,14,5,Occurrents of his wrong’d estate.
400,14,6,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,14,7,_Ξι̑._
400,14,8,Ulysses fains
400,14,9,For his true good:
400,14,10,His pious swain’s
400,14,11,Faith understood.
400,14,12,"But he the rough way took from forth the port,"
400,14,13,"Through woods and hill - tops, seeking the resort"
400,14,14,Where Pallas said divine Eumæus liv’d;
400,14,15,"Who of the fortunes, that were first achiev’d"
400,14,16,"By God - like Ithacus in household rights,"
400,14,17,Had more true care than all his prosylites.[1]
400,14,18,"He found him sitting in his cottage door,"
400,14,19,Where he had rais’d to ev’ry airy blore
400,14,20,"A front of great height, and in such a place"
400,14,21,"That round ye might behold, of circular grace"
400,14,22,A walk so wound about it; which the swain
400,14,23,(In absence of his far - gone sovereign)
400,14,24,"Had built himself, without his queen’s supply,"
400,14,25,"Or old Laertes’, to see safely lie"
400,14,26,His houséd herd. The inner part he wrought
400,14,27,"Of stones, that thither his own labours brought,"
400,14,28,"Which with an hedge of thorn he fenc’d about,"
400,14,29,And compass’d all the hedge with pales cleft out
400,14,30,"Of sable oak, that here and there he fix’d"
400,14,31,Frequent and thick. Within his yard he mix’d
400,14,32,Twelve styes to lodge his herd; and ev’ry stye
400,14,33,Had room and use for fifty swine to lie;
400,14,34,But those were females all. The male swine slept
400,14,35,Without doors ever; nor was their herd kept
400,14,36,"Fair like the females, since they suffer’d still"
400,14,37,"Great diminution, he being forc’d to kill"
400,14,38,And send the fattest to the dainty feasts
400,14,39,Affected by th’ ungodly wooing guests.
400,14,40,Their number therefore but three hundred were
400,14,41,"And sixty. By them mastiffs, as austere"
400,14,42,"As savage beasts, lay ever, their fierce strain"
400,14,43,"Bred by the herdsman, a mere prince of men,"
400,14,44,Their number four. Himself was then applied
400,14,45,"In cutting forth a fair - hued ox’s hide,"
400,14,46,To fit his feet with shoes. His servants held
400,14,47,"Guard of his swine: three, here and there, at field,"
400,14,48,"The fourth he sent to city with a sow,"
400,14,49,Which must of force be offer’d to the vow
400,14,50,"The Wooers made to all satiety,"
400,14,51,To serve which still they did those off’rings ply.
400,14,52,The fate - born - dogs - to - bark took sudden view[2]
400,14,53,"Of Odyssëus, and upon him flew"
400,14,54,"With open mouth. He, cunning to appall"
400,14,55,"A fierce dog’s fury, from his hand let fall"
400,14,56,"His staff to earth, and sat him careless down."
400,14,57,And yet to him had one foul wrong been shown
400,14,58,"Where most his right lay, had not instantly"
400,14,59,"The herdsman let his hide fall, and his cry"
400,14,60,(With frequent stones flung at the dogs) repell’d
400,14,61,This way and that their eager course they held;
400,14,62,"When through the entry past, he thus did mourn:"
400,14,63,“O father! How soon had you near been torn
400,14,64,"By these rude dogs, whose hurt had branded me"
400,14,65,With much neglect of you! But Deity
400,14,66,Hath giv’n so many other sighs and cares
400,14,67,"To my attendant state, that well unwares"
400,14,68,"You might be hurt for me, for here I lie"
400,14,69,Grieving and mourning for the Majesty
400,14,70,"That, God - like, wonted to be ruling here,"
400,14,71,"Since now I fat his swine for others’ cheer,"
400,14,72,"Where he, perhaps, errs hungry up and down,"
400,14,73,"In countries, nations, cities, all unknown;"
400,14,74,"If any where he lives yet, and doth see"
400,14,75,"The sun’s sweet beams. But, father, follow me,"
400,14,76,"That, cheer’d with wine and food, you may disclose"
400,14,77,"From whence you truly are, and all the woes"
400,14,78,"Your age is subject to.” This said, he led"
400,14,79,"Into his cottage, and of osiers spread"
400,14,80,"A thicken’d hurdle, on whose top he strow’d"
400,14,81,"A wild - goat’s shaggy skin, and then bestow’d"
400,14,82,"His own couch on it, that was soft and great."
400,14,83,Ulysses joy’d to see him so entreat
400,14,84,"His uncouth presence, saying: “Jove requite,"
400,14,85,"And all th’ immortal Gods, with that delight"
400,14,86,"Thou most desir’st, thy kind receipt of me,"
400,14,87,friend to human hospitality!”
400,14,88,Eumæus answer’d: “Guest! If one much worse
400,14,89,"Arriv’d here than thyself, it were a curse"
400,14,90,"To my poor means, to let a stranger taste"
400,14,91,"Contempt for fit food. Poor men, and unplac’d"
400,14,92,"In free seats of their own, are all from Jove"
400,14,93,Commended to our entertaining love.
400,14,94,"But poor is th’ entertainment I can give,"
400,14,95,Yet free and loving. Of such men as live
400,14,96,"The lives of servants, and are still in fear"
400,14,97,"Where young lords govern, this is all the cheer"
400,14,98,They can afford a stranger. There was one
400,14,99,"That us’d to manage this now desert throne,"
400,14,100,"To whom the Gods deny return, that show’d"
400,14,101,"His curious favour to me, and bestow’d"
400,14,102,"Possessions on me, a most - wishéd wife,"
400,14,103,"A house, and portion, and a servant’s life,"
400,14,104,Fit for the gift a gracious king should give;
400,14,105,"Who still took pains himself, and God made thrive"
400,14,106,"His personal endeavour, and to me"
400,14,107,"His work the more increas’d, in which you see"
400,14,108,I now am conversant. And therefore much
400,14,109,"His hand had help’d me, had Heav’n’s will been such,"
400,14,110,"He might have here grown old. But he is gone,"
400,14,111,And would to God the whole successión
400,14,112,"Of Helen might go with him, since for her"
400,14,113,"So many men died, whose fate did confer"
400,14,114,"My liege to Troy, in Agamemnon’s grace,"
400,14,115,"To spoil her people, and her turrets race!”"
400,14,116,"This said, his coat to him he straight did gird,"
400,14,117,And to his styes went that contain’d his herd;
400,14,118,"From whence he took out two, slew both, and cut"
400,14,119,"Both fairly up; a fire enflam’d, and put"
400,14,120,"To spit the joints; which roasted well, he set"
400,14,121,"With spit and all to him, that he might eat"
400,14,122,"From thence his food in all the singeing heat,"
400,14,123,Yet dredg’d it first with flour; then fill’d his cup
400,14,124,"With good sweet wine; sat then, and cheer’d him up"
400,14,125,"“Eat now, my guest, such lean swine as are meat"
400,14,126,"For us poor swains; the fat the Wooers eat,"
400,14,127,"In whose minds no shame, no remorse, doth move,"
400,14,128,Though well they know the bless’d Gods do not love
400,14,129,"Ungodly actions, but respect the right,"
400,14,130,And in the works of pious men delight.
400,14,131,"But these are worse than impious, for those"
400,14,132,"That vow t’ injustice, and profess them foes"
400,14,133,"To other nations, enter on their land,"
400,14,134,And Jupiter (to show his punishing hand
400,14,135,"Upon th’ invaded, for their penance then)"
400,14,136,"Gives favour to their foes, though wicked men,"
400,14,137,"To make their prey on them; who, having freight"
400,14,138,"Their ships with spoil enough, weigh anchor straight,"
400,14,139,"And each man to his house; (and yet ev’n these,"
400,14,140,Doth pow’rful fear of God’s just vengeance seize
400,14,141,Ev’n for that prize in which they so rejoice)
400,14,142,"But these men, knowing (having heard the voice"
400,14,143,Of God by some means) that sad death hath reft
400,14,144,"The ruler here, will never suffer left"
400,14,145,"Their unjust wooing of his wife, nor take"
400,14,146,"Her often answer, and their own roofs make"
400,14,147,"Their fit retreats, but (since uncheck’d they may)"
400,14,148,"They therefore will make still his goods their prey,"
400,14,149,"Without all spare or end. There is no day,"
400,14,150,"Nor night, sent out from God, that ever they"
400,14,151,"Profane with one beast’s blood, or only two,"
400,14,152,But more make spoil of; and the wrongs they do
400,14,153,"In meat’s excess to wine as well extend,"
400,14,154,"Which as excessively their riots spend,"
400,14,155,"Yet still leave store, for sure his means were great,"
400,14,156,"And no heroë, that hath choicest seat"
400,14,157,"Upon the fruitful neighbour - continent,"
400,14,158,"Or in this isle itself, so opulent"
400,14,159,"Was as Ulysses; no, nor twenty such,"
400,14,160,"Put altogether, did possess so much."
400,14,161,Whose herds and flocks I’ll tell to ev’ry head:
400,14,162,Upon the continent he daily fed
400,14,163,"Twelve herds of oxen, no less flocks of sheep,"
400,14,164,"As many herds of swine, stalls large and steep,"
400,14,165,"And equal sorts of goats, which tenants there,"
400,14,166,"And his own shepherds, kept. Then fed he here"
400,14,167,"Eleven fair stalls of goats, whose food hath yield"
400,14,168,In the extreme part of a neighbour - field.
400,14,169,"Each stall his herdsman hath, an honest swain,"
400,14,170,Yet ev’ry one must ev’ry day sustain
400,14,171,"The load of one beast (the most - fat, and best"
400,14,172,Of all the stall - fed) to the Wooers’ feast.
400,14,173,"And I, for my part, of the swine I keep"
400,14,174,(With four more herdsmen) ev’ry day help steep
400,14,175,"The Wooers’ appetites in blood of one,"
400,14,176,The most select our choice can fall upon.”
400,14,177,"To this Ulysses gave good ear, and fed,"
400,14,178,"And drunk his wine, and vex’d, and ravishéd"
400,14,179,His food for mere vexation. Seeds of ill
400,14,180,"His stomach sow’d, to hear his goods go still"
400,14,181,"To glut of Wooers. But his dinner done,"
400,14,182,"And stomach fed to satisfactión,"
400,14,183,"He drunk a full bowl, all of only wine,"
400,14,184,"And gave it to the guardian of his swine,"
400,14,185,"Who took it, and rejoic’d; to whom he said:"
400,14,186,"“O friend, who is it that, so rich, hath paid"
400,14,187,"Price for thy service, whose commended pow’r,"
400,14,188,"Thou sayst, to grace the Grecian conquerour,"
400,14,189,At Ilion perish’d? Tell me. It may fall
400,14,190,"I knew some such. The great God knows, and all"
400,14,191,"The other deathless Godheads, if I can,"
400,14,192,"Far having travell’d, tell of such a man.”"
400,14,193,"Eumæus answer’d: “Father, never one,"
400,14,194,Of all the strangers that have touch’d upon
400,14,195,"This coast, with his life’s news could ever yet"
400,14,196,"Of queen, or lov’d son, any credit get."
400,14,197,"These travellers, for clothes, or for a meal,"
400,14,198,"At all adventures, any lie will tell."
400,14,199,Nor do they trade for truth. Not any man
400,14,200,"That saw the people Ithacensian,"
400,14,201,"Of all their sort, and had the queen’s supplies,"
400,14,202,"Did ever tell her any news, but lies."
400,14,203,"She graciously receives them yet, inquires"
400,14,204,"Of all she can, and all in tears expires."
400,14,205,"It is th’ accustom’d law, that women keep,"
400,14,206,"Their husbands elsewhere dead, at home to weep."
400,14,207,"But do thou quickly, father, forge a tale,"
400,14,208,"Some coat, or cloak, to keep thee warm withal,"
400,14,209,"Perhaps some one may yield thee; but for him,"
400,14,210,Vultures and dogs have torn from ev’ry limb
400,14,211,"His porous skin, and forth his soul is fled,"
400,14,212,"His corse at sea to fishes forfeited,"
400,14,213,"Or on the shore lies hid in heaps of sand,"
400,14,214,"And there hath he his ebb, his native strand"
400,14,215,With friends’ tears flowing. But to me past all
400,14,216,"Were tears created, for I never shall"
400,14,217,"Find so humane a royal master more,"
400,14,218,"Whatever sea I seek, whatever shore."
400,14,219,"Nay, to my father, or my mother’s love"
400,14,220,"Should I return, by whom I breathe and move,"
400,14,221,Could I so much joy offer; nor these eyes
400,14,222,(Though my desires sustain extremities
400,14,223,For their sad absence) would so fain be blest
400,14,224,"With sight of their lives, in my native nest,"
400,14,225,"As with Ulysses dead; in whose last rest,"
400,14,226,"O friend, my soul shall love him. He’s not here"
400,14,227,"Nor do I name him like a flatterer,"
400,14,228,But as one thankful for his love and care
400,14,229,To me a poor man; in the rich so rare.
400,14,230,"And be he past all shores where sun can shine,"
400,14,231,I will invoke him as a soul divine.”
400,14,232,"“O friend,” said he, “to say, and to believe,"
400,14,233,"He cannot live, doth too much licence give"
400,14,234,"To incredulity; for, not to speak"
400,14,235,"At needy randon, but my breath to break"
400,14,236,"In sacred oath, Ulysses shall return."
400,14,237,And when his sight recomforts those that mourn
400,14,238,"In his own roofs, then give me cloak, and coat,"
400,14,239,And garments worthy of a man of note.
400,14,240,"Before which, though need urg’d me never so,"
400,14,241,"I’ll not receive a thread, but naked go."
400,14,242,"No less I hate him than the gates of hell,"
400,14,243,That poorness can force an untruth to tell.
400,14,244,"Let Jove then (Heav’n’s chief God) just witness bear,"
400,14,245,"And this thy hospitable table here,"
400,14,246,"Together with unblam’d Ulysses’ house,"
400,14,247,"In which I find receipt so gracious,"
400,14,248,What I affirm’d of him shall all be true.
400,14,249,This instant year thine eyes ev’n here shall view
400,14,250,"Thy lord Ulysses. Nay, ere this month’s end,"
400,14,251,"Return’d full - home, he shall revenge extend"
400,14,252,"To ev’ry one, whose ever deed hath done"
400,14,253,Wrong to his wife and his illustrious son.”
400,14,254,"“O father,” he replied, “I’ll neither give"
400,14,255,"Thy news reward, nor doth Ulysses live."
400,14,256,"But come, enough of this, let’s drink and eat,"
400,14,257,And never more his memory repeat.
400,14,258,It grieves my heart to be remember’d thus
400,14,259,By anyone of one so glorious.
400,14,260,"But stand your oath in your assertion strong,"
400,14,261,"And let Ulysses come, for whom I long,"
400,14,262,"For whom his wife, for whom his agéd sire,"
400,14,263,"For whom his son consumes his god - like fire,"
400,14,264,"Whose chance I now must mourn, and ever shall."
400,14,265,Whom when the Gods had brought to be as tall
400,14,266,"As any upright plant, and I had said,"
400,14,267,He would amongst a court of men have sway’d
400,14,268,"In counsels, and for form have been admir’d"
400,14,269,"Ev’n with his father, some God misinspir’d,"
400,14,270,"Or man took from him his own equal mind,"
400,14,271,And pass’d him for the Pylian shore to find
400,14,272,"His long - lost father. In return from whence,"
400,14,273,"The Wooers’ pride way - lays his innocence,"
400,14,274,That of divine Arcesius all the race
400,14,275,"May fade to Ithaca, and not the grace"
400,14,276,Of any name left to it. But leave we
400,14,277,"His state, however, if surpris’d he be,"
400,14,278,Or if he scape. And may Saturnius’ hand
400,14,279,Protect him safely to his native land.
400,14,280,"Do thou then, father, show your griefs, and cause"
400,14,281,Of your arrival here; nor break the laws
400,14,282,"That truth prescribes you, but relate your name,"
400,14,283,"And of what race you are, your father’s fame,"
400,14,284,"And native city’s; ship and men unfold,"
400,14,285,"That to this isle convey’d you, since I hold"
400,14,286,"Your here arrival was not all by shore,"
400,14,287,Nor that your feet your agéd person bore.”
400,14,288,"He answer’d him: “I’ll tell all strictly true,"
400,14,289,"If time, and food, and wine enough, accrue"
400,14,290,"Within your roof to us, that freely we"
400,14,291,May sit and banquet. Let your business be
400,14,292,"Discharg’d by others; for, when all is done,"
400,14,293,"I cannot easily, while the year doth run"
400,14,294,"His circle round, run over all the woes,"
400,14,295,"Beneath which, by the course the Gods dispose,"
400,14,296,"My sad age labours. First, I’ll tell you then,"
400,14,297,From ample Crete I fetch my native strain;
400,14,298,"My father wealthy, whose house many a life"
400,14,299,"Brought forth and bred besides by his true wife,"
400,14,300,"But me a bond - maid bore, his concubine."
400,14,301,Yet tender’d was I as his lawful line
400,14,302,By him of whose race I my life profess.
400,14,303,"Castor his name, surnam’d Hylacides."
400,14,304,"A man, in fore - times, by the Cretan state,"
400,14,305,"For goods, good children, and his fortunate"
400,14,306,"Success in all acts, of no mean esteem."
400,14,307,But death - conferring Fates have banish’d him
400,14,308,"To Pluto’s kingdom. After whom, his sons"
400,14,309,"By lots divided his possessions,"
400,14,310,And gave me passing little; yet bestow’d
400,14,311,"A house on me, to which my virtues woo’d"
400,14,312,"A wife from rich men’s roofs; nor was borne low,"
400,14,313,"Nor last in fight, though all nerves fail me now."
400,14,314,"But I suppose, that you, by thus much seen,"
400,14,315,Know by the stubble what the corn hath been.
400,14,316,"For, past all doubt, affliction past all mean"
400,14,317,"Hath brought my age on; but, in seasons past,"
400,14,318,"Both Mars and Pallas have with boldness grac’d,"
400,14,319,"And fortitude, my fortunes, when I chus’d"
400,14,320,"Choice men for ambush, prest to have produc’d"
400,14,321,Ill to mine enemies; my too vent’rous spirit
400,14,322,"Set never death before mine eyes, for merit,"
400,14,323,"But, far the first advanc’d still, still I strook"
400,14,324,Dead with my lance whoever overtook
400,14,325,My speed of foot. Such was I then for war.
400,14,326,"But rustic actions ever fled me far,"
400,14,327,"And household thrift, which breeds a famous race."
400,14,328,"In oar - driv’n ships did I my pleasures place,"
400,14,329,"In battles, light darts, arrows. Sad things all,"
400,14,330,And into others’ thoughts with horror fall.
400,14,331,"But what God put into my mind, to me"
400,14,332,I still esteem’d as my felicity.
400,14,333,"As men of sev’ral metals are address’d,"
400,14,334,So sev’ral forms are in their souls impress’d.
400,14,335,"Before the sons of Greece set foot in Troy,"
400,14,336,"Nine times, in chief, I did command enjoy"
400,14,337,"Of men and ships against our foreign foe,"
400,14,338,And all I fitly wish’d succeeded so.
400,14,339,"Yet, after this, I much exploit achiev’d,"
400,14,340,When straight my house in all possessions thriv’d.
400,14,341,"Yet, after that, I great and rev’rend grew"
400,14,342,"Amongst the Cretans, till the Thund’rer drew"
400,14,343,Our forces out in his foe - Troy decrees;
400,14,344,A hateful service that dissolv’d the knees
400,14,345,"Of many a soldier. And to this was I,"
400,14,346,"And famous Idomen, enjoin’d t’ apply"
400,14,347,"Our ships and pow’rs, Nor was there to be heard"
400,14,348,"One reason for denial, so preferr’d"
400,14,349,Was the unreasonable people’s rumour.
400,14,350,"Nine years we therefore fed the martial humour,"
400,14,351,"And in the tenth, de - peopling Priam’s town,"
400,14,352,We sail’d for home. But God had quickly blown
400,14,353,Our fleet in pieces; and to wretched me
400,14,354,"The counsellor Jove did much mishap decree,"
400,14,355,"For, only one month, I had leave t’ enjoy"
400,14,356,"My wife and children, and my goods t’ employ."
400,14,357,"But, after this, my mind for Ægypt stood,"
400,14,358,"When nine fair ships I rigg’d forth for the flood,"
400,14,359,"Mann’d them with noble soldiers, all things fit"
400,14,360,For such a voyage soon were won to it.
400,14,361,"Yet six days after stay’d my friends in feast,"
400,14,362,While I in banquets to the Gods addrest
400,14,363,Much sacred matter for their sacrifice.
400,14,364,"The seventh, we boarded; and the Northern skies"
400,14,365,"Lent us a frank and passing prosp’rous gale,"
400,14,366,‘Fore which we bore us free and easy sail
400,14,367,As we had back’d a full and frolic tide;
400,14,368,"Nor felt one ship misfortune for her pride,"
400,14,369,"But safe we sat, our sailors and the wind"
400,14,370,Consenting in our convoy. When heav’n shin’d
400,14,371,"In sacred radiance of the fifth fair day,"
400,14,372,"To sweetly - water’d Egypt reach’d our way,"
400,14,373,And there we anchor’d; where I charg’d my men
400,14,374,"To stay aboard, and watch. Dismissing then"
400,14,375,"Some scouts to get the hill - tops, and discover,"
400,14,376,They (to their own intemperance giv’n over).
400,14,377,"Straight fell to forage the rich fields, and thence"
400,14,378,"Enforce both wives and infants, with th’ expence"
400,14,379,Of both their bloods. When straight the rumour flew
400,14,380,"Up to the city. Which heard, up they drew"
400,14,381,"By day’s First break, and all the field was fill’d"
400,14,382,"With foot and horse, whose arms did all things gild."
400,14,383,And then the lightning - loving Deity cast
400,14,384,A foul flight on my soldiers; nor stood fast
400,14,385,"One man of all. About whom mischief stood,"
400,14,386,And with his stern steel drew in streams the blood
400,14,387,The greater part fed in their dissolute veins;
400,14,388,"The rest were sav’d, and made enthralléd swains"
400,14,389,To all the basest usages there bred.
400,14,390,"And then, ev’n Jove himself supplied my head"
400,14,391,"With saving counsel; though I wish’d to die,"
400,14,392,"And there in Egypt with their slaughters lie,"
400,14,393,"So much grief seiz’d me, but Jove made me yield,"
400,14,394,"Dishelm my head, take from my neck my shield,"
400,14,395,"Hurl from my hand my lance, and to the troop"
400,14,396,"Of horse the king led instantly made up,"
400,14,397,"Embrace, and kiss his knees; whom pity won"
400,14,398,"To give me safety, and (to make me shun"
400,14,399,"The people’s outrage, that made in amain,"
400,14,400,All jointly fir’d with thirst to see me slain)
400,14,401,"He took me to his chariot, weeping, home,"
400,14,402,"Himself with fear of Jove’s wrath overcome,"
400,14,403,"Who yielding souls receives, and takes most ill"
400,14,404,All such as well may save yet love to kill.
400,14,405,"Seven years I sojourn’d here, and treasure gat"
400,14,406,"In good abundance of th’ Ægyptian state,"
400,14,407,"For all would give; but when th’ eighth year began,"
400,14,408,A knowing fellow (that would gnaw a man[3]
400,14,409,"Like to a vermin, with his hellish brain,"
400,14,410,"And many an honest soul ev’n quick had slain,"
400,14,411,"Whose name was Phœnix) close accosted me,"
400,14,412,"And with insinuations, such as he"
400,14,413,"Practis’d on others, my consent he gain’d"
400,14,414,"To go into Phœnicia, where remain’d"
400,14,415,"His house, and living. And with him I liv’d"
400,14,416,A cómplete year; but when were all arriv’d
400,14,417,"The months and days, and that the year again"
400,14,418,"Was turning round, and ev’ry season’s reign"
400,14,419,"Renew’d upon us, we for Libya went,"
400,14,420,"When, still inventing crafts to circumvent,"
400,14,421,"He made pretext, that I should only go"
400,14,422,"And help convey his freight; but thought not so,"
400,14,423,"For his intent was to have sold me there,"
400,14,424,And made good gain for finding me a year.
400,14,425,"Yet him I follow’d, though suspecting this,"
400,14,426,"For, being aboard his ship, I must be his"
400,14,427,Of strong necessity. She ran the flood
400,14,428,"(Driven with a northern gale, right free, and good)"
400,14,429,"Amids the full stream, full on Crete. But then"
400,14,430,"Jove plotted death to him and all his men,"
400,14,431,"For (put off quite from Crete, and so far gone"
400,14,432,"That shore was lost, and we set eye on none,"
400,14,433,But all show’d heav’n and sea) above our keel
400,14,434,"Jove pointed right a cloud as black as hell,"
400,14,435,"Beneath which all the sea hid, and from whence"
400,14,436,"Jove thunder’d as his hand would never thence,"
400,14,437,And thick into our ship he threw his flash;[4]
400,14,438,"That ’gainst a rock, or flat, her keel did dash"
400,14,439,With headlong rapture. Of the sulphur all
400,14,440,Her bulk did savour; and her men let fall
400,14,441,"Amids the surges, on which all lay tost,"
400,14,442,"Like sea - gulls, round about her sides, and lost."
400,14,443,And so God took all home - return from them.
400,14,444,"But Jove himself, though plung’d in that extreme,"
400,14,445,Recover’d me by thrusting on my hand
400,14,446,"The ship’s long mast. And, that my life might stand"
400,14,447,"A little more up, I embrac’d it round;"
400,14,448,"And on the rude winds, that did ruins sound,"
400,14,449,Nine days we hover’d. In the tenth black night
400,14,450,"A huge sea cast me on Thesprotia’s height,"
400,14,451,"Where the heroë Phidon, that was chief"
400,14,452,"Of all the Thesprots, gave my wrack relief,"
400,14,453,Without the price of that redemptión[5]
400,14,454,That Phœnix fish’d for. Where the king’s lov’d son
400,14,455,"Came to me, took me by the hand, and led"
400,14,456,"Into his court my poor life, surfeited"
400,14,457,With cold and labour; and because my wrack
400,14,458,"Chanc’d on his father’s shore, he let not lack"
400,14,459,"My plight or coat, or cloak, or anything"
400,14,460,Might cherish heat in me. And here the king
400,14,461,"Said, he receiv’d Ulysses as his guest,"
400,14,462,"Observ’d him friend - like, and his course addrest"
400,14,463,"Home to his country, showing there to me"
400,14,464,"Ulysses’ goods, a very treasury"
400,14,465,"Of brass, and gold, and steel of curious frame."
400,14,466,And to the tenth succession of his name
400,14,467,"He laid up wealth enough, to serve beside"
400,14,468,"In that king’s house, so hugely amplified"
400,14,469,His treasure was. But from his court the king
400,14,470,"Affirm’d him shipp’d for the Dodonean spring,"
400,14,471,"To hear, from out the high - hair’d oak of Jove,"
400,14,472,Counsel from him for means to his remove
400,14,473,"To his lov’d country, whence so many a year"
400,14,474,He had been absent; if he should appear
400,14,475,"Disguis’d, or manifest; and further swore"
400,14,476,"In his mid court, at sacrifice, before"
400,14,477,"These very eyes, that he had ready there"
400,14,478,"Both ship and soldiers, to attend and bear"
400,14,479,"Him to his country. But, before, it chanc’d"
400,14,480,That a Thesprotian ship was to be launch’d
400,14,481,"For the much - corn - renown’d Dulichian land,"
400,14,482,In which the king gave to his men command
400,14,483,"To take, and bring me under tender hand"
400,14,484,"To king Acastus. But, in ill design"
400,14,485,"Of my poor life, did their desires combine,"
400,14,486,"So far forth, as might ever keep me under"
400,14,487,"In fortune’s hands, and tear my state in sunder."
400,14,488,And when the water - treader far away
400,14,489,"Had left the land, then plotted they the day"
400,14,490,"Of my long servitude, and took from me"
400,14,491,"Both coat and cloak, and all things that might be"
400,14,492,"Grace in my habit, and in place put on"
400,14,493,"These tatter’d rags, which now you see upon"
400,14,494,"My wretched bosom. When heav’n’s light took sea,[6]"
400,14,495,"They fetch’d the field - works of fair Ithaca,"
400,14,496,"And in the arm’d ship, with a well - wreath’d cord,"
400,14,497,"They straitly bound me, and did all disboard"
400,14,498,"To shore to supper, in contentious rout."
400,14,499,Yet straight the Gods themselves took from about
400,14,500,"My pressed limbs the bands, with equal ease,"
400,14,501,"And I, my head in rags wrapp’d, took the seas,"
400,14,502,"Descending by the smooth stern, using then"
400,14,503,"My hands for oars, and made from these bad men"
400,14,504,"Long way in little time. At last, I fetch’d"
400,14,505,"A goodly grove of oaks, whose shore I reach’d,"
400,14,506,And cast me prostrate on it. When they knew
400,14,507,"My thus - made ‘scape, about the shores they flew,"
400,14,508,"But, soon not finding, held it not their best"
400,14,509,"To seek me further, but return’d to rest"
400,14,510,"Aboard their vessel. Me the Gods lodg’d close,"
400,14,511,Conducting me into the safe repose
400,14,512,A good man’s stable yielded. And thus Fate
400,14,513,This poor hour added to my living date.”
400,14,514,"“O wretch of guests,” said he, “thy tale hath stirr’d"
400,14,515,"My mind to much ruth, both how thou hast err’d,"
400,14,516,"And suffer’d, hearing in such good parts shown."
400,14,517,"But, what thy chang’d relation would make known"
400,14,518,"About Ulysses, I hold neither true,"
400,14,519,Nor will believe. And what need’st thou pursue
400,14,520,"A lie so rashly, since he sure is so"
400,14,521,"As I conceive, for which my skill shall go?"
400,14,522,"The safe return my king lacks cannot be,"
400,14,523,"He is so envied of each Deity,"
400,14,524,"So clear, so cruelly. For not in Troy"
400,14,525,"They gave him end, nor let his corpse enjoy"
400,14,526,"The hands of friends (which well they might have done,"
400,14,527,"He manag’d arms to such perfection,"
400,14,528,"And should have had his sepulchre, and all,"
400,14,529,"And all the Greeks to grace his funeral,"
400,14,530,And this had giv’n a glory to his son
400,14,531,Through all times future) but his head is run
400,14,532,"Unseen, unhonour’d, into Harpies’ maws."
400,14,533,"For my part, I’ll not meddle with the cause,"
400,14,534,"I live a separate life amongst my swine,"
400,14,535,"Come at no town for any need of mine,"
400,14,536,Unless the circularly - witted queen[7]
400,14,537,(When any far - come guest is to be seen
400,14,538,"That brings her news) commands me bring a brawn,"
400,14,539,"About which (all things being in question drawn,"
400,14,540,"That touch the king) they sit, and some are sad"
400,14,541,"For his long absence, some again are glad"
400,14,542,"To waste his goods unwreak’d, all talking still."
400,14,543,"But, as for me, I nourish’d little will"
400,14,544,"T’ inquire or question of him, since the man"
400,14,545,"That feign’d himself the fled Ætolian,"
400,14,546,"For slaught’ring one, through many regions stray’d,"
400,14,547,"In my stall, as his diversory, stay’d."
400,14,548,"Where well entreating him, he told me then,"
400,14,549,"Amongst the Cretans, with king Idomen,"
400,14,550,"He saw Ulysses at his ship’s repair,"
400,14,551,That had been brush’d with the enragéd air;
400,14,552,"And that in summer, or in autumn, sure,"
400,14,553,"With all his brave friends and rich furniture,"
400,14,554,"He would be here; and nothing so, nor so."
400,14,555,"But thou, an old man, taught with so much woe"
400,14,556,"As thou hast suffer’d, to be season’d true,"
400,14,557,"And brought by his fate, do not here pursue"
400,14,558,"His gratulations with thy cunning lies,"
400,14,559,Thou canst not soak so through my faculties
400,14,560,For I did never either honour thee
400,14,561,"Or give thee love, to bring these tales to me,"
400,14,562,But in my fear of hospitable Jove
400,14,563,Thou didst to this pass my affections move.”
400,14,564,"“You stand exceeding much incredulous,”"
400,14,565,"Replied Ulysses, “to have witness’d thus"
400,14,566,"My word and oath, yet yield no trust at all."
400,14,567,"But make me now a covenant here, and call"
400,14,568,"The dreadful Gods to witness, that take seat"
400,14,569,In large Olympus: If your king’s retreat
400,14,570,"Prove made, ev’n hither, you shall furnish me"
400,14,571,"With cloak, and coat, and make my passage free"
400,14,572,"For lov’d Dulichius; if, as fits my vow,"
400,14,573,"Your king return not, let your servants throw"
400,14,574,"My old limbs headlong from some rock most high,"
400,14,575,That other poor men may take fear to lie.”
400,14,576,"The herdsman, that had gifts in him divine,"
400,14,577,"Replied: “O guest, how shall this fame of mine"
400,14,578,"And honest virtue, amongst men, remain"
400,14,579,"Now, and hereafter, without worthy stain,"
400,14,580,"If I, that led thee to my hovel here,"
400,14,581,"And made thee fitting hospitable cheer,"
400,14,582,"Should after kill thee, and thy lovéd mind"
400,14,583,Force from thy bones? Or how should stand inclin’d
400,14,584,"With any faith my will t’ importune Jove,"
400,14,585,In any pray’r hereafter for his love?
400,14,586,"Come, now ’tis supper’s hour, and instant haste"
400,14,587,"My men will make home, when our sweet repast"
400,14,588,We’ll taste together.” This discourse they held
400,14,589,"In mutual kind, when from a neighbour - field"
400,14,590,"His swine and swine - herds came, who in their cotes"
400,14,591,"Inclos’d their herds for sleep, which mighty throats"
400,14,592,Laid out in ent’ring. Then the God - like swain
400,14,593,His men enjoin’d thus: “Bring me to be slain
400,14,594,"A chief swine female, for my stranger guest,"
400,14,595,"When altogether we will take our feast,"
400,14,596,"Refreshing now our spirits, that all day take"
400,14,597,"Pains in our swine’s good, who may therefore make"
400,14,598,"For our pains with them all amends with one,"
400,14,599,"Since others eat our labours, and take none.”"
400,14,600,"This said, his sharp steel hew’d down wood, and they"
400,14,601,"A passing fat swine hal’d out of the sty,"
400,14,602,"Of five years old, which to the fire they put."
400,14,603,When first Eumæus from the front did cut
400,14,604,"The sacred hair, and cast it in the fire,"
400,14,605,Then pray’d to heav’n; for still before desire
400,14,606,"Was serv’d with food, in their so rude abodes,"
400,14,607,"Not the poor swine - herd would forget the Gods,"
400,14,608,"Good souls they bore, how bad soever were"
400,14,609,The habits that their bodies’ parts did bear.
400,14,610,"When all the deathless Deities besought,"
400,14,611,That wise Ulysses might be safely brought
400,14,612,Home to his house; then with a log of oak
400,14,613,"Left lying by, high lifting it, a stroke"
400,14,614,He gave so deadly it made life expire.
400,14,615,"Then cut the rest her throat, and all in fire"
400,14,616,"They hid and sing’d her, cut her up; and then,"
400,14,617,"The master took the office from the men,"
400,14,618,Who on the altar did the parts impose
400,14,619,That serv’d for sacrifice; beginning close
400,14,620,"About the belly, thorough which he went."
400,14,621,And (all the chief fat gath’ring) gave it vent
400,14,622,(Part dredg’d with flour) into the sacred flame;
400,14,623,"Then cut they up the joints, and roasted them,"
400,14,624,"Drew all from spit, and serv’d in dishes all."
400,14,625,Then rose Eumæus (who was general
400,14,626,In skill to guide each act his fit event)
400,14,627,"And, all in seven parts cut, the first part went"
400,14,628,"To service of the Nymphs and Mercury,"
400,14,629,To whose names he did rites of piety
400,14,630,In vows particular; and all the rest
400,14,631,"He shar’d to ev’ry one, but his lov’d guest"
400,14,632,"He grac’d with all the chine, and of that king,"
400,14,633,"To have his heart cheer’d, set up ev’ry string."
400,14,634,"Which he observing said: “I would to Jove,"
400,14,635,"Eumæus, thou liv’dst in his worthy love"
400,14,636,"As great as mine, that giv’st to such a guest"
400,14,637,As my poor self of all thy goods the best.”
400,14,638,"Eumæus answer’d: “Eat, unhappy wretch,"
400,14,639,And to what here is at thy pleasure reach.
400,14,640,"This I have, this thou want’st; thus God will give,"
400,14,641,"Thus take away, in us, and all that live."
400,14,642,"To his will’s equal centre all things fall,"
400,14,643,"His mind he must have, for he can do all.”"
400,14,644,"Thus having eat, and to his wine descended,"
400,14,645,"Before he serv’d his own thirst, he commended"
400,14,646,The first use of it in fit sacrifice
400,14,647,"(As of his meat) to all the Deities,"
400,14,648,And to the city - racer’s hand applied
400,14,649,"The second cup, whose place was next his side."
400,14,650,"Mesauliús did distribute the meat,"
400,14,651,"(To which charge was Eumæus solely set,"
400,14,652,"In absence of Ulysses, by the queen"
400,14,653,And old Laertes) and this man had been
400,14,654,"Bought by Eumæus, with his faculties,"
400,14,655,Employ’d then in the Taphian merchandise.
400,14,656,"But now, to food appos’d, and order’d thus,"
400,14,657,"All fell. Desire suffic’d, Mesauliús"
400,14,658,"Did take away. For bed then next they were,"
400,14,659,All thoroughly satisfied with cómplete cheer.
400,14,660,"The night then came, ill, and no taper shin’d;"
400,14,661,Jove rain’d her whole date; th’ ever - wat’ry wind
400,14,662,Zephyr blew loud; and Laertiades
400,14,663,(Approving kind Eumæus’ carefulness
400,14,664,"For his whole good) made far about assay,"
400,14,665,To get some cast - off cassock (lest he lay
400,14,666,"That rough night cold) of him, or anyone"
400,14,667,Of those his servants; when he thus begun:
400,14,668,"“Hear me, Eumæus, and my other friends,"
400,14,669,"I’ll use a speech that to my glory tends,"
400,14,670,Since I have drunk wine past my usual guise.
400,14,671,"_Strong wine commands the fool and moves the wise,_"
400,14,672,"Moves and impels him too to sing and dance,"
400,14,673,"And break in pleasant laughters, and, perchance,"
400,14,674,Prefer a speech too that were better in.
400,14,675,"But when my spirits once to speak begin,"
400,14,676,"I shall not then dissemble. Would to heav’n,"
400,14,677,"I were as young, and had my forces driv’n"
400,14,678,"As close together, as when once our pow’rs"
400,14,679,We led to ambush under th’ Ilion tow’rs!
400,14,680,Where Ithacus and Menelaus were
400,14,681,"The two commanders, when it pleas’d them there"
400,14,682,"To take myself for third, when to the town"
400,14,683,"And lofty walls we led, we couch’d close down,"
400,14,684,"All arm’d, amids the osiers and the reeds,"
400,14,685,Which oftentimes th’ o’er - flowing river feeds.
400,14,686,"The cold night came, and th’ icy northern gale"
400,14,687,"Blew bleak upon us, after which did fall"
400,14,688,"A snow so cold, it cut as in it beat"
400,14,689,"A frozen water, which was all concrete"
400,14,690,About our shields like crystal. All made feign
400,14,691,"Above our arms to clothe, and clothe again."
400,14,692,"And so we made good shift, our shields beside"
400,14,693,"Clapp’d close upon our clothes, to rest and hide"
400,14,694,"From all discovery. But I, poor fool,"
400,14,695,"Left my weeds with my men, because so cool"
400,14,696,I thought it could not prove; which thought my pride
400,14,697,"A little strengthen’d, being loth to hide"
400,14,698,A goodly glitt’ring garment I had on;
400,14,699,"And so I follow’d with my shield alone,"
400,14,700,And that brave weed. But when the night near ended
400,14,701,"Her course on earth, and that the stars descended,"
400,14,702,"I jogg’d Ulysses, who lay passing near,"
400,14,703,"And spake to him, that had a nimble ear,"
400,14,704,"Assuring him, that long I could not lie"
400,14,705,"Amongst the living, for the fervency"
400,14,706,"Of that sharp night would kill me, since as then"
400,14,707,My evil angel made me with my men
400,14,708,Leave all weeds but a fine one. But I know
400,14,709,’Tis vain to talk; here wants all remedy now.
400,14,710,"This said, he bore that understanding part"
400,14,711,In his prompt spirit that still show’d his art
400,14,712,"In fight and counsel, saying (in a word,"
400,14,713,"And that low whisper’d) peace, lest you afford"
400,14,714,"Some Greek note of your softness. No word more,"
400,14,715,But made as if his stern austerity bore
400,14,716,"My plight no pity; yet, as still he lay"
400,14,717,"His head reposing on his hand, gave way"
400,14,718,"To this invention: ‘Hear me friends, a dream"
400,14,719,(That was of some celestial light a beam)
400,14,720,"Stood in my sleep before me, prompting me"
400,14,721,"With this fit notice: ‘We are far,’ said he,"
400,14,722,"‘From out our fleet. Let one go then, and try"
400,14,723,If Agamemnon will afford supply
400,14,724,To what we now are strong.’ This stirr’d a speed
400,14,725,In Thoas to th’ affair; whose purple weed
400,14,726,"He left for haste; which then I took, and lay"
400,14,727,"In quiet after, till the dawn of day."
400,14,728,"This shift Ulysses made for one in need,"
400,14,729,"And would to heav’n, that youth such spirit did feed"
400,14,730,"Now in my nerves, and that my joints were knit"
400,14,731,With such a strength as made me then held fit
400,14,732,To lead men with Ulysses! I should then
400,14,733,"Seem worth a weed that fits a herdsman’s men,"
400,14,734,"For two respects, to gain a thankful friend,"
400,14,735,And to a good man’s need a good extend.”
400,14,736,"“O father,” said Eumæus “thou hast shown"
400,14,737,"Good cause for us to give thee good renown,"
400,14,738,Not using any word that was not freed
400,14,739,"From all least ill. Thou, therefore, shalt not need"
400,14,740,"Or coat, or other thing, that aptly may"
400,14,741,Beseem a wretched suppliant for defray
400,14,742,"Of this night’s need. But, when her golden throne"
400,14,743,"The morn ascends, you must resume your own,"
400,14,744,"For here you must not dream of many weeds,"
400,14,745,Or any change at all. We serve our needs
400,14,746,"As you do yours; one back, one coat. But when"
400,14,747,"Ulysses’ lovéd son returns, he then"
400,14,748,"Shall give you coat and cassock, and bestow"
400,14,749,"Your person where your heart and soul is now,”"
400,14,750,"This said, he rose, made near the fire his bed,"
400,14,751,Which all with goats’ and sheep skins he bespread.
400,14,752,"All which Ulysses with himself did line,"
400,14,753,"With whom; besides, he chang’d a gaberdine,"
400,14,754,"Thick lin’d, and soft, which still he made his shift"
400,14,755,When he would dress him ’gainst the horrid drift
400,14,756,"Of tempest, when deep winter’s season blows."
400,14,757,"Nor pleas’d it him to lie there with his sows,"
400,14,758,"But while Ulysses slept there, and close by"
400,14,759,"The other younkers, he abroad would lie,"
400,14,760,And therefore arm’d him. Which set cheerful fare
400,14,761,"Before Ulysses’ heart, to see such care"
400,14,762,"Of his goods taken, how far off soever"
400,14,763,His fate his person and his wealth should sever.
400,14,764,"First then, a sharp - edg’d sword he girt about"
400,14,765,"His well - spread shoulders, and (to shelter out"
400,14,766,The sharp West wind that blew) he put him on
400,14,767,"A thick - lin’d jacket, and yet cast upon"
400,14,768,All that the large hide of a goat well - fed.
400,14,769,"A lance then took he, with a keen steel head,"
400,14,770,To be his keep - off both ’gainst men and dogs.
400,14,771,"And thus went he to rest with his male hogs,"
400,14,772,"That still abroad lay underneath a rock,"
400,14,773,Shield to the North wind’s ever - eager shock.

400,15,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,15,2,Minerva to his native seat.
400,15,3,"Exhorts Ulysses’ son’s retreat,"
400,15,4,"In bed, and waking. He receives"
400,15,5,"Gifts of Atrides, and so leaves"
400,15,6,"The Spartan court. And, going aboard,"
400,15,7,Doth favourable way afford
400,15,8,"To Theoclymenus, that was"
400,15,9,"The Argive augur, and sought pass,"
400,15,10,Fled for a slaughter he had done.
400,15,11,"Eumæus tells Laertes’ son,"
400,15,12,"How he became his father’s man,"
400,15,13,Being sold by the Phœnician
400,15,14,"For some agreed - on faculties,"
400,15,15,From forth the Syrian isle made prise.
400,15,16,"Telemachus, arrived at home,"

400,15,18,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,15,19,O.
400,15,20,From Sparta’s strand
400,15,21,Makes safe access
400,15,22,To his own land
400,15,23,Ulyssides.
400,15,24,"In Lacedæmon, large, and apt for dances,[1]"
400,15,25,Athenian Pallas her access advances
400,15,26,"Up to the great - in - soul Ulysses’ seed,"
400,15,27,Suggesting his return now fit for deed.
400,15,28,She found both him and Nestor’s noble son
400,15,29,"In bed, in front of that fair mansión,"
400,15,30,"Nestorides surpris’d with pleasing sleep,"
400,15,31,"But on the watch Ulysses’ son did keep,"
400,15,32,"Sleep could not enter, cares did so excite"
400,15,33,"His soul, through all the solitary night,"
400,15,34,"For his lov’d father. To him, near, she said:"
400,15,35,“Telemachus! ’Tis time that now were stay’d
400,15,36,"Thy foreign travels, since thy goods are free"
400,15,37,"For those proud men that all will eat from thee,"
400,15,38,"Divide thy whole possessións, and leave"
400,15,39,Thy too - late presence nothing to receive.
400,15,40,"Incite the shrill - voic’d Menelaus then,"
400,15,41,"To send thee to thy native seat again,"
400,15,42,While thou mayst yet find in her honour strong
400,15,43,"Thy blameless mother, ’gainst thy fathers’ wrong."
400,15,44,"For both the father, and the brothers too,"
400,15,45,"Of thy lov’d mother, will not suffer so"
400,15,46,"Extended any more her widow’s bed,"
400,15,47,"But make her now her richest wooer wed,"
400,15,48,"Eurymachus, who chiefly may augment"
400,15,49,"Her gifts, and make her jointure eminent."
400,15,50,"And therefore haste thee, lest, in thy despite,"
400,15,51,Thy house stand empty of thy native right.
400,15,52,For well thou know’st what mind a woman bears;
400,15,53,"The house of him, whoever she endears"
400,15,54,"Herself in nuptials to, she sees increas’d,"
400,15,55,The issue of her first lov’d lord deceas’d
400,15,56,"Forgotten quite, and never thought on more."
400,15,57,"In thy return then, the re - counted store"
400,15,58,"Thou find’st reserv’d, to thy most trusted maid"
400,15,59,"Commit in guard, till Heav’n’s Pow’rs have purvey’d"
400,15,60,"A wife, in virtue and in beauty’s grace,"
400,15,61,"Of fit sort for thee, to supply her place."
400,15,62,"And this note more I’ll give thee, which repose"
400,15,63,In sure remembrance: The best sort of those
400,15,64,That woo thy mother watchful scouts address
400,15,65,"Both in the straits of th’ Ithacensian seas,"
400,15,66,"And dusty Samos, with intent t’ invade"
400,15,67,"And take thy life, ere thy return be made."
400,15,68,"Which yet I think will fail, and some of them"
400,15,69,That waste thy fortunes taste of that extreme
400,15,70,"They plot for thee. But keep off far from shore,"
400,15,71,"And day and night sail, for a fore - right blore,"
400,15,72,Whoever of th’ Immortals that vow guard
400,15,73,"And ’scape to thy return, will see prepar’d."
400,15,74,"As soon as thou arriv’st, dismiss to town"
400,15,75,"Thy ship and men, and first of all make down"
400,15,76,"To him that keeps thy swine, and doth conceive"
400,15,77,A tender care to see thee well survive.
400,15,78,"There sleep; and send him to the town, to tell"
400,15,79,"The chaste Penelopé, that safe and well"
400,15,80,"Thou liv’st in his charge, and that Pylos’ sands"
400,15,81,The place contain’d from whence thy person lands.”
400,15,82,Thus she to large Olympus made ascent.
400,15,83,When with his heel a little touch he lent
400,15,84,"To Nestor’s son, whose sleep’s sweet chains he loos’d,"
400,15,85,"Bad rise, and see in chariot inclos’d"
400,15,86,"Their one - hoof’d horse, that they might straight be gone."
400,15,87,"“No such haste,” he replied, “Night holds her throne,"
400,15,88,And dims all way to course of chariot.
400,15,89,The morn will soon get up. Nor see forgot
400,15,90,"The gifts with haste, that will, I know, be rich,"
400,15,91,And put into our coach with gracious speech
400,15,92,By lance - fam’d Menelaus. Not a guest
400,15,93,"Shall touch at his house, but shall store his breast"
400,15,94,"With fit mind of an hospitable man,"
400,15,95,To last as long as any daylight can
400,15,96,"His eyes recomfort, in such gifts as he"
400,15,97,Will proofs make of his hearty royalty.”
400,15,98,"He had no sooner said, but up arose"
400,15,99,"Aurora, that the golden hills repose."
400,15,100,"And Menelaus, good - at - martial - cries,"
400,15,101,"From Helen’s bed rais’d, to his guest applies"
400,15,102,His first appearance. Whose repair made known
400,15,103,"T’ Ulysses’ lov’d son, on his robe was thrown"
400,15,104,"About his gracious body, his cloak cast"
400,15,105,"Athwart his ample shoulders, and in haste"
400,15,106,"Abroad he went, and did the king accost:"
400,15,107,"“Atrides, guarded with heav’n’s deified host,"
400,15,108,"Grant now remission to my native right,"
400,15,109,My mind now urging mine own house’s sight.”
400,15,110,"“Nor will I stay,” said he, “thy person long,"
400,15,111,Since thy desires to go are grown so strong.
400,15,112,I should myself be angry to sustain
400,15,113,The like detention urg’d by other men.
400,15,114,"Who loves a guest past mean, past mean will hate,"
400,15,115,_The mean in all acts bears the best estate._
400,15,116,"A like ill ’tis, to thrust out such a guest"
400,15,117,"As would not go, as to detain the rest."
400,15,118,"We should a guest love, while he loves to stay,"
400,15,119,"And, when he likes not, give him loving way."
400,15,120,"Yet suffer so, that we may gifts impose"
400,15,121,"In coach to thee; which ere our hands inclose,"
400,15,122,"Thine eyes shall see, lest else our loves may glose."
400,15,123,"Besides, I’ll cause our women to prepare"
400,15,124,"What our house yields, and merely so much fare"
400,15,125,"As may suffice for health. Both well will do,"
400,15,126,Both for our honour and our profit too.
400,15,127,"And, serving strength with food, you after may"
400,15,128,As much earth measure as will match the clay.
400,15,129,"If you will turn your course from sea, and go"
400,15,130,Through Greece and Argos (that myself may so
400,15,131,"Keep kind way with thee) I’ll join horse, and guide"
400,15,132,T’ our human cities. Nor ungratified
400,15,133,Will anyone remit us; some one thing
400,15,134,"Will each present us, that along may bring"
400,15,135,"Our pass with love, and prove our virtues blaz’d:"
400,15,136,"A caldron, or a tripod, richly - braz’d,"
400,15,137,"Two mules, a bowl of gold, that hath his price"
400,15,138,Heighten’d with emblems of some rare device.”
400,15,139,The wise prince answer’d: “I would gladly go
400,15,140,"Home to mine own, and see that govern’d so"
400,15,141,"That I may keep what I for certain hold,"
400,15,142,Not hazard that for only hop’d - for gold.
400,15,143,I left behind me none so all ways fit
400,15,144,"To give it guard, as mine own trust with it."
400,15,145,"Besides, in this broad course which you propose,"
400,15,146,My father seeking I myself may lose.”
400,15,147,"When this the shrill - voic’d Menelaus heard,"
400,15,148,He charg’d his queen and maids to see prepar’d
400,15,149,"Breakfast, of what the whole house held for best."
400,15,150,"To him rose Eteoneus from his rest,"
400,15,151,"Whose dwelling was not far off from the court,"
400,15,152,And his attendance his command did sort
400,15,153,"With kindling fires, and furth’ring all the roast,"
400,15,154,In act of whose charge heard no time he lost.
400,15,155,"Himself then to an odorous room descended,"
400,15,156,Whom Megapenthe and his queen attended.
400,15,157,"Come to his treasury, a two - ear’d cup"
400,15,158,"He choos’d of all, and made his son bear up"
400,15,159,A silver bowl. The queen then taking stand
400,15,160,"Aside her chest, where by her own fair hand"
400,15,161,"Lay vests of all hues wrought, she took out one"
400,15,162,"Most large, most artful, chiefly fair, and shone"
400,15,163,"Like to a star, and lay of all the last."
400,15,164,Then through the house with either’s gift they past;
400,15,165,When to Ulysses’ son Atrides said:
400,15,166,"“Telemachus, since so entirely sway’d"
400,15,167,"Thy thoughts are with thy vow’d return now tender’d,"
400,15,168,May Juno’s thund’ring husband see it render’d
400,15,169,"Perfect at all parts, action answ’ring thought."
400,15,170,"Of all the rich gifts, in my treasure sought,"
400,15,171,I give thee here the most in grace and best.
400,15,172,"A bowl but silver, yet the brim’s comprest"
400,15,173,"With gold, whose fabric his desert doth bring"
400,15,174,"From Vulcan’s hand, presented by the king"
400,15,175,"And great heroë of Sidonia’s state,"
400,15,176,When at our parting he did consummate
400,15,177,His whole house - keeping. This do thou command.”
400,15,178,"This said, he put the round bowl in his hand,"
400,15,179,And then his strong son Megapenthe plac’d
400,15,180,"The silver cup before him, amply grac’d"
400,15,181,"With work and lustre. Helen (standing by,"
400,15,182,"And in her hand the robe, her housewifery)"
400,15,183,"His name rememb’ring, said: “And I present,"
400,15,184,"Lov’d son, this gift to thee, the monument"
400,15,185,"Of the so - many - lovéd Helen’s hands,"
400,15,186,"Which, at the knitting of thy nuptial bands,"
400,15,187,"Present thy wife. In mean space, may it lie"
400,15,188,By thy lov’d mother; but to me apply
400,15,189,"Thy pleasure in it, and thus take thy way"
400,15,190,"To thy fair house, and country’s wishéd stay.”"
400,15,191,"Thus gave she to his hands the veil, and he"
400,15,192,The acceptation author’d joyfully.
400,15,193,Which in the chariot’s chest Pisistratus
400,15,194,"Plac’d with the rest, and held miraculous."
400,15,195,The yellow - headed king then led them all
400,15,196,To seats and thrones plac’d in his spacious hall.
400,15,197,"The hand - maid water brought, and gave it stream"
400,15,198,"From out a fair and golden ewer to them,"
400,15,199,From whose hands to a silver caldron fled
400,15,200,"The troubled wave. A bright board then she spread,"
400,15,201,On which another rev’rend dame set bread.
400,15,202,To which more servants store of victuals serv’d.
400,15,203,"Eteonëus was the man that kerv’d,"
400,15,204,And Megapenthe fill’d them all their wine.
400,15,205,"All fed and drank, till all felt care decline"
400,15,206,For those refreshings. Both the guests did go
400,15,207,"To horse, and coach, and forth the portico"
400,15,208,"A little issued, when the yellow King"
400,15,209,"Brought wine himself, that, with an offering"
400,15,210,"To all the Gods, they might their journey take."
400,15,211,"He stood before the Gods, and thus he spake:"
400,15,212,“Farewell young Princes! To grave Nestor’s ear
400,15,213,This salutation from my gratitude bear:
400,15,214,"That I profess, in all our Ilion wars,"
400,15,215,He stood a careful father to my cares.”
400,15,216,To whom the wise Ulyssides replied:
400,15,217,"“With all our utmost shall be signified,"
400,15,218,"Jove - kept Atrides, your right royal will;"
400,15,219,"And would to God, I could as well fulfill"
400,15,220,"Mine own mind’s gratitude, for your free grace,"
400,15,221,"In telling to Ulysses, in the place"
400,15,222,"Of my return, in what accomplish’d kind"
400,15,223,I have obtain’d the office of a friend
400,15,224,At your deservings; whose fair end you crown
400,15,225,"With gifts so many, and of such renown!”"
400,15,226,"His wish, that he might find in his retreat"
400,15,227,His father safe return’d (to so repeat
400,15,228,The king’s love to him) was saluted thus:
400,15,229,"An eagle rose, and in her seres did truss"
400,15,230,"A goose, all - white, and huge, a household one,"
400,15,231,"Which men and women, crying out upon,"
400,15,232,"Pursued, but she, being near the guests, her flight"
400,15,233,"Made on their right hand, and kept still fore - right"
400,15,234,"Before their horses; which observ’d by them,"
400,15,235,"The spirits in all their minds took joys extreme,"
400,15,236,"Which Nestor’s son thus question’d: “Jove - kept king,[2]"
400,15,237,"Yield your grave thoughts, if this ostentful thing"
400,15,238,"(This eagle, and this goose) touch us, or you?”"
400,15,239,"He put to study, and not knowing how"
400,15,240,"To give fit answer, Helen took on her"
400,15,241,"Th’ ostent’s solution, and did this prefer:"
400,15,242,"“Hear me, and I will play the prophet’s part,"
400,15,243,"As the Immortals cast it in my heart,"
400,15,244,"And as, I think, will make the true sense known:"
400,15,245,"As this Jove’s bird, from out the mountains flown,"
400,15,246,"(Where was her eyrie, and whence rose her race,)"
400,15,247,"Truss’d up this goose, that from the house did graze,"
400,15,248,"So shall Ulysses, coming from the wild"
400,15,249,"Of seas and suff’rings, reach, unreconcil’d,"
400,15,250,"His native home, where ev’n this hour he is,"
400,15,251,And on those house - fed Wooers those wrongs of his
400,15,252,"Will shortly wreak, with all their miseries.”"
400,15,253,"“O,” said Telemachus, “if Saturnian Jove"
400,15,254,"To my desires thy dear presage approve,"
400,15,255,"When I arrive, I will perform to thee"
400,15,256,"My daily vows, as to a Deity.”"
400,15,257,"This said, he us’d his scourge upon the horse,"
400,15,258,That through the city freely made their course
400,15,259,"To field, and all day made that first speed good."
400,15,260,"But when the sun set, and obscureness stood"
400,15,261,"In each man’s way, they ended their access"
400,15,262,"At Pheras, in the house of Diocles,"
400,15,263,"Son to Orsilochus, Alphëus’ seed,"
400,15,264,Who gave them guest - rites; and sleep’s natural need
400,15,265,"They that night served there. When Aurora rose,"
400,15,266,"They join’d their horse, took coach, and did dispose"
400,15,267,Their course for Pylos; whose high city soon
400,15,268,They reach’d. Nor would Telemachus be won
400,15,269,"To Nestor’s house, and therefore order’d thus"
400,15,270,"His speech to Nestor’s son, Pisistratus:"
400,15,271,“How shall I win thy promise to a grace
400,15,272,That I must ask of thee? We both embrace
400,15,273,"The names of bed - fellows, and in that name"
400,15,274,Will glory as an adjunct of our fame;
400,15,275,"Our fathers’ friendship, our own equal age,"
400,15,276,"And our joint travel, may the more engage"
400,15,277,"Our mutual concord. Do not then assay,"
400,15,278,"My God - lov’d friend, to lead me from my way"
400,15,279,"To my near ship, but take a course direct"
400,15,280,"And leave me there, lest thy old sire’s respect,"
400,15,281,"In his desire to love me, hinder so"
400,15,282,"My way for home, that have such need to go.”"
400,15,283,"This said, Nestorides held all discourse"
400,15,284,"In his kind soul, how best he might enforce"
400,15,285,"Both promise and performance; which, at last;"
400,15,286,"He vow’d to venture, and directly cast"
400,15,287,His horse about to fetch the ship and shore.
400,15,288,"Where come, his friends’ most lovely gifts he bore"
400,15,289,"Aboard the ship, and in her hind - deck plac’d"
400,15,290,"The veil that Helen’s curious hand had grac’d,"
400,15,291,"And Menelaus’ gold, and said: “Away,"
400,15,292,"Nor let thy men, in any least date, stay,"
400,15,293,"But quite put off, ere I get home, and tell"
400,15,294,"The old duke, you are past; for passing well"
400,15,295,I know his mind to so exceed all force
400,15,296,"Of any pray’r, that he will stay your course,"
400,15,297,"Himself make hither, all your course call back,"
400,15,298,"And, when he hath you, have no thought to rack"
400,15,299,"Him from his bounty, and to let you part"
400,15,300,"Without a present, but be vex’d at heart"
400,15,301,"With both our pleadings, if we once put move"
400,15,302,The least repression of his fiery love.”
400,15,303,"Thus took he coach, his fair - man’d steeds scourg’d on"
400,15,304,"Along the Pylian city, and anon"
400,15,305,His father’s court reach’d; while Ulysses’ son
400,15,306,"Bade board, and arm; which with a thought was done."
400,15,307,"His rowers set, and he rich odours firing"
400,15,308,"In his hind - deck, for his secure retiring,"
400,15,309,"To great Athenia, to his ship came flying"
400,15,310,"A stranger, and a prophet, as relying"
400,15,311,"On wishéd passage, having newly slain"
400,15,312,"A man at Argos, yet his race’s vein"
400,15,313,"Flow’d from Melampus, who in former date"
400,15,314,"In Pylos liv’d, and had a huge estate,"
400,15,315,"But fled his country, and the punishing hand"
400,15,316,"Of great - soul’d Neleus, in a foreign land,"
400,15,317,"From that most famous mortal, having held"
400,15,318,"A world of riches, nor could be compell’d"
400,15,319,To render restitution in a year.
400,15,320,"In mean space, living as close prisoner"
400,15,321,"In court of Phylacus, and for the sake"
400,15,322,"Of Neleus’ daughter mighty cares did take,"
400,15,323,Together with a grievous languor sent
400,15,324,"From grave Erinnys, that did much torment"
400,15,325,His vexéd conscience; yet his life’s expence
400,15,326,"He scap’d, and drave the loud - voiced oxen thence,"
400,15,327,"To breed - sheep Pylos, bringing vengeance thus"
400,15,328,"Her foul demerit to great Neleüs,"
400,15,329,And to his brother’s house reduc’d his wife.
400,15,330,Who yet from Pylos did remove his life
400,15,331,"For feed - horse Argos, where his fate set down"
400,15,332,"A dwelling for him, and in much renown"
400,15,333,"Made govern many Argives, where a spouse"
400,15,334,"He took to him, and built a famous house."
400,15,335,"There had he born to him Antiphates,"
400,15,336,And forceful Mantius. To the first of these
400,15,337,Was great Oïcleus born: Oïcleus gat
400,15,338,"Amphiaraus, that the popular state"
400,15,339,"Had all their health in, whom ev’n from his heart"
400,15,340,"Jove lov’d, and Phœbus in the whole desert"
400,15,341,Of friendship held him; yet not bless’d so much
400,15,342,"That age’s threshold he did ever touch,"
400,15,343,But lost his life by female bribery.[3]
400,15,344,"Yet two sons author’d his posterity,"
400,15,345,"Alcmæon, and renown’d Amphilochus."
400,15,346,"Mantius had issue Polyphidius,"
400,15,347,"And Clytus, but Aurora ravish’d him,"
400,15,348,"For excellence of his admiréd limb,"
400,15,349,And interested him amongst the Gods.
400,15,350,His brother knew men’s good and bad abodes
400,15,351,"The best of all men, after the decease"
400,15,352,Of him that perish’d in unnatural peace
400,15,353,At spacious Thebes. Apollo did inspire
400,15,354,His knowing soul with a prophetic fire.
400,15,355,"Who, angry with his father, took his way"
400,15,356,"To Hyperesia; where, making stay,"
400,15,357,"He prophesied to all men, and had there"
400,15,358,"A son call’d Theoclymenus, who here"
400,15,359,"Came to Telemachus, and found aboard"
400,15,360,"Himself at sacrifice, whom in a word"
400,15,361,"He thus saluted: “O friend, since I find,"
400,15,362,"Ev’n here at ship, a sacrificing mind"
400,15,363,"Inform your actions, by your sacrifice,"
400,15,364,And by that worthy choice of Deities
400,15,365,"To whom you offer, by yourself, and all"
400,15,366,"These men that serve your course maritimal,"
400,15,367,"Tell one that asks the truth, nor give it glose,"
400,15,368,"Both who, and whence, you are? From what seed rose"
400,15,369,Your royal person? And what city’s tow’rs
400,15,370,Hold habitation to your parents’ pow’rs?”
400,15,371,He answer’d: “Stranger! The sure truth is this:
400,15,372,I am of Ithaca; my father is
400,15,373,"(Or was) Ulysses, but austere death now"
400,15,374,Takes his state from him; whose event to know
400,15,375,"Himself being long away, I set forth thus"
400,15,376,With ship and soldiers.” Theoclymenus
400,15,377,As freely said: “And I to thee am fled
400,15,378,"From forth my country, for a man struck dead"
400,15,379,"By my unhappy hand, who was with me"
400,15,380,"Of one self - tribe, and of his pedigree"
400,15,381,"Are many friends and brothers, and the sway"
400,15,382,Of Achive kindred reacheth far away.
400,15,383,"From whom, because I fear their spleens suborn"
400,15,384,Blood and black fate against me (being born
400,15,385,To be a wand’rer among foreign men)
400,15,386,"Make thy fair ship my rescue, and sustain"
400,15,387,My life from slaughter. Thy deservings may
400,15,388,"Perform that mercy, and to them I pray.”"
400,15,389,"“Nor will I bar,” said he, “thy will to make"
400,15,390,"My means and equal ship thy aid, but take"
400,15,391,"(With what we have here, in all friendly use)"
400,15,392,Thy life from any violence that pursues.”
400,15,393,"Thus took he in his lance, and it extended"
400,15,394,"Aloft the hatches, which himself ascended."
400,15,395,"The prince took seat at stern, on his right hand"
400,15,396,"Set Theoclymenus, and gave command"
400,15,397,"To all his men to arm, and see made fast"
400,15,398,Amidst the hollow keel the beechen mast
400,15,399,"With able halsers, hoise sail, launch; which soon"
400,15,400,He saw obey’d. And then his ship did run
400,15,401,A merry course; blue - eyed Minerva sent
400,15,402,"A fore - right gale, tumultuous, vehement,"
400,15,403,"Along the air, that her way’s utmost yield"
400,15,404,"The ship might make, and plough the brackish field."
400,15,405,"Then set the sun, and night black’d all the ways."
400,15,406,"The ship, with Jove’s wind wing’d, where th’ Epian sways,"
400,15,407,"Fetch’d Pheras first, then Elis the divine,"
400,15,408,"And then for those isles made, that sea - ward shine"
400,15,409,"For form and sharpness like a lance’s head,"
400,15,410,About which lay the Wooers ambushéd;
400,15,411,"On which he rush’d, to try if he could ’scape"
400,15,412,"His plotted death, or serve her treach’rous rape."
400,15,413,"And now return we to Eumæus’ shed,"
400,15,414,"Where, at their food with others marshalléd,"
400,15,415,Ulysses and his noble herdsman sate.
400,15,416,To try if whose love’s curious estate
400,15,417,"Stood firm to his abode, or felt it fade,"
400,15,418,And so would take each best cause to persuade
400,15,419,"His guest to town, Ulysses thus contends:"
400,15,420,"“Hear me, Eumæus, and ye other friends."
400,15,421,"Next morn to town I covet to be gone,"
400,15,422,"To beg some others’ alms, not still charge one."
400,15,423,"Advise me well then, and as well provide"
400,15,424,"I may be fitted with an honest guide,"
400,15,425,"For through the streets, since need will have it so,"
400,15,426,"I’ll tread, to try if any will bestow"
400,15,427,"A dish of drink on me, or bit of bread,"
400,15,428,Till to Ulysses’ house I may be led;
400,15,429,"And there I’ll tell all - wise Penelope news,"
400,15,430,"Mix with the Wooers’ pride, and, since they use"
400,15,431,"To fare above the full, their hands excite"
400,15,432,To some small feast from out their infinite:
400,15,433,"For which, I’ll wait, and play the servingman,"
400,15,434,"Fairly enough, command the most they can."
400,15,435,"For I will tell thee, note me well, and hear,"
400,15,436,"That, if the will be of Heav’n’s Messenger,"
400,15,437,"(Who to the works of men, of any sort,"
400,15,438,"Can grace infuse, and glory) nothing short"
400,15,439,"Am I of him, that doth to most aspire"
400,15,440,"In any service, as to build a fire,"
400,15,441,"To cleave sere wood, to roast or boil their meat,"
400,15,442,"To wait at board, mix wine, or know the neat,"
400,15,443,"Or any work, in which the poor - call’d worst"
400,15,444,To serve the rich - call’d best in Fate are forc’d.”
400,15,445,"He, angry with him, said: “Alas, poor guest,"
400,15,446,Why did this counsel ever touch thy breast?
400,15,447,"Thou seek’st thy utter spoil beyond all doubt,"
400,15,448,"If thou giv’st venture on the Wooers’ rout,"
400,15,449,"Whose wrong and force affects the iron heav’n,"
400,15,450,Their light delights are far from being giv’n
400,15,451,To such grave servitors. Youths richly trick’d
400,15,452,"In coats or cassocks, locks divinely slick’d,"
400,15,453,"And looks most rapting, ever have the gift"
400,15,454,"To taste their crown’d cups, and full trenchers shift."
400,15,455,"Their tables ever like their glasses shine,"
400,15,456,"Loaded with bread, with varied flesh, and wine."
400,15,457,"And thou go thither? Stay, for here do none"
400,15,458,"Grudge at thy presence, nor myself, nor one"
400,15,459,Of all I feed. But when Ulysses’ son
400,15,460,"Again shall greet us, he shall put thee on"
400,15,461,"Both coat and cassock, and thy quick retreat"
400,15,462,Set where thy heart and soul desire thy seat.”
400,15,463,Industrious Ulysses gave reply:
400,15,464,"“I still much wish, that Heav’n’s chief Deity"
400,15,465,"Lov’d thee, as I do, that hast eas’d my mind"
400,15,466,Of woes and wand’rings never yet confin’d.
400,15,467,"_Nought is more wretched in a human race,"
400,15,468,"Than country’s want, and shift from place to place._"
400,15,469,But for the baneful belly men take care
400,15,470,"Beyond good counsel, whosoever are"
400,15,471,In compass of the wants it undergoes
400,15,472,"By wand’rings, losses, or dependent woes."
400,15,473,"Excuse me therefore, if I err’d at home;"
400,15,474,"Which since thou wilt make here, as overcome"
400,15,475,"With thy command for stay, I’ll take on me"
400,15,476,"Cares appertaining to this place, like thee."
400,15,477,"Does then Ulysses’ sire, and mother, breathe,"
400,15,478,Both whom he left in th’ age next door to death?
400,15,479,"Or are they breathless, and descended where"
400,15,480,"The dark house is, that never day doth clear?”"
400,15,481,"“Laertes lives,” said he, “but ev’ry hour"
400,15,482,Beseecheth Jove to take from him the pow’r
400,15,483,That joins his life and limbs; for with a moan
400,15,484,That breeds a marvel he laments his son
400,15,485,"Depriv’d by death, and adds to that another"
400,15,486,"Of no less depth for that dead son’s dead mother,"
400,15,487,"Whom he a virgin wedded, which the more"
400,15,488,"Makes him lament her loss, and doth deplore"
400,15,489,"Yet more her miss, because her womb the truer"
400,15,490,"Was to his brave son, and his slaughter slew her."
400,15,491,"Which last love to her doth his life engage,"
400,15,492,And makes him live an undigested age.
400,15,493,O! such a death she died as never may
400,15,494,"Seize anyone that here beholds the day,"
400,15,495,"That either is to any man a friend,"
400,15,496,Or can a woman kill in such a kind.
400,15,497,"As long as she had being, I would be"
400,15,498,"A still inquirer (since ’twas dear to me,"
400,15,499,"Though death to her, to hear his name) when she"
400,15,500,"Heard of Ulysses, for I might be bold,"
400,15,501,"She brought me up, and in her love did hold"
400,15,502,"My life, compar’d with long - veil’d Ctimené,"
400,15,503,Her youngest issue (in some small degree
400,15,504,Her daughter yet preferr’d) a brave young dame.
400,15,505,And when of youth the dearly - lovéd flame
400,15,506,"Was lighted in us, marriage did prefer"
400,15,507,The maid to Samos; whence was sent for her
400,15,508,"Infinite riches, when the queen bestow’d"
400,15,509,"A fair new suit, new shoes, and all, and vow’d"
400,15,510,"Me to the field, but passing loth to part,"
400,15,511,As loving me more than she lov’d her heart.
400,15,512,And these I want now; but their business grows
400,15,513,"Upon me daily, which the Gods impose,"
400,15,514,"To whom I hold all, give account to them,"
400,15,515,For I see none left to the diadem
400,15,516,"That may dispose all better. So, I drink"
400,15,517,And eat of what is here; and whom I think
400,15,518,"Worthy or rev’rend, I have giv’n to, still,"
400,15,519,These kinds of guest - rites; for the household ill
400,15,520,"(Which, where the queen is, riots) takes her still"
400,15,521,From thought of these things. Nor is it delight
400,15,522,"To hear, from her plight, of or work or word;"
400,15,523,The Wooers spoil all. But yet my men will board
400,15,524,"Her sorrows often with discourse of all,"
400,15,525,Eating and drinking of the festival
400,15,526,"That there is kept, and after bring to field"
400,15,527,Such things as servants make their pleasures yield.
400,15,528,"“O me, Eumæus,” said Laertes’ son,"
400,15,529,"“Hast thou then err’d so of a little one,"
400,15,530,"Like me, from friends and country? Pray thee say,"
400,15,531,"And say a truth, doth vast Destruction lay"
400,15,532,"Her hand upon the wide - way’d seat of men,[4]"
400,15,533,"Where dwelt thy sire and rev’rend mother then,"
400,15,534,"That thou art spar’d there? Or else, set alone"
400,15,535,"In guard of beeves, or sheep, set th’ enemy on,"
400,15,536,"Surpris’d, and shipp’d, transferr’d, and sold thee here?"
400,15,537,"He that bought thee paid well, yet bought not dear.”"
400,15,538,"“Since thou enquir’st of that, my guest,” said he,"
400,15,539,"“Hear and be silent, and, mean space, sit free"
400,15,540,In use of these cups to thy most delights;
400,15,541,Unspeakable in length now are the nights.
400,15,542,"Those that affect sleep yet, to sleep have leave,"
400,15,543,"Those that affect to hear, their hearers give."
400,15,544,But sleep not ere your hour; _much sleep doth grieve._
400,15,545,"Whoever lists to sleep, away to bed,"
400,15,546,"Together with the morning raise his head,"
400,15,547,"Together with his fellows break his fast,"
400,15,548,And then his lord’s herd drive to their repast.
400,15,549,"We two, still in our tabernacle here"
400,15,550,"Drinking and eating, will our bosoms cheer"
400,15,551,With memories and tales of our annoys.
400,15,552,"_Betwixt his sorrows ev’ry human joys,_"
400,15,553,"He most, who most hath felt and furthest err’d."
400,15,554,And now thy will to act shall be preferr’d.
400,15,555,"There is an isle above Ortygia,"
400,15,556,"If thou hast heard, they call it Syria,"
400,15,557,"Where, once a day, the sun moves backward still."
400,15,558,"’Tis not so great as good, for it doth fill"
400,15,559,"The fields with oxen, fills them still with sheep,"
400,15,560,"Fills roofs with wine, and makes all corn there cheap."
400,15,561,"No dearth comes ever there, nor no disease"
400,15,562,"That doth with hate us wretched mortals seize,"
400,15,563,"But when men’s varied nations, dwelling there"
400,15,564,"In any city, enter th’ aged year,"
400,15,565,"The silver - bow - bearer, the Sun, and She"
400,15,566,"That bears as much renown for archery,"
400,15,567,"Stoop with their painless shafts, and strike them dead,"
400,15,568,"As one would sleep, and never keep the bed."
400,15,569,"In this isle stand two cities, betwixt whom"
400,15,570,All things that of the soil’s fertility come
400,15,571,In two parts are divided. And both these
400,15,572,"My father rul’d, Ctesius Ormenides,"
400,15,573,A man like the Immortals. With these states
400,15,574,The cross - biting Phœnicians traffick’d rates
400,15,575,"Of infinite merchandise in ships brought there,"
400,15,576,In which they then were held exempt from peer.
400,15,577,"There dwelt within my father’s house a dame,"
400,15,578,"Born a Phœnician, skilful in the frame"
400,15,579,"Of noble housewif’ries, right tall and fair."
400,15,580,Her the Phœnician great - wench - net - lay’r[5]
400,15,581,"With sweet words circumvented, as she was"
400,15,582,Washing her linen. To his amorous pass
400,15,583,"He brought her first, shor’d from his ship to her;"
400,15,584,"To whom he did his whole life’s love prefer,"
400,15,585,Which of these breast - exposing dames the hearts
400,15,586,"Deceives, though fashion’d of right honest parts."
400,15,587,"He ask’d her after, what she was, and whence?"
400,15,588,"She, passing presently, the excellence"
400,15,589,"Told of her father’s turrets, and that she"
400,15,590,Might boast herself sprung from the progeny
400,15,591,"Of the rich Sidons, and the daughter was"
400,15,592,Of the much - year - revénued Arybas;
400,15,593,"But that the Taphian pirates made her prise,"
400,15,594,"As she return’d from her field - housewif’ries,"
400,15,595,"Transferr’d her hither, and, at that man’s house"
400,15,596,"Where now she liv’d, for value precious"
400,15,597,Sold her to th’ owner. He that stole her love
400,15,598,"Bade her again to her birth’s seat remove,"
400,15,599,"To see the fair roofs of her friends again,"
400,15,600,"Who still held state, and did the port maintain"
400,15,601,"Herself reported. She said: ‘Be it so,"
400,15,602,"So you, and all that in your ship shall row,"
400,15,603,Swear to return me in all safety hence.’
400,15,604,"All swore. Th’ oath past, with ev’ry consequence,"
400,15,605,"She bade: ‘Be silent now, and not a word"
400,15,606,"Do you, or any of your friends, afford,"
400,15,607,"Meeting me afterward in any way,"
400,15,608,Or at the washing - fount; lest some display
400,15,609,"Be made, and told the old man, and he then"
400,15,610,"Keep me strait bound, to you and to your men"
400,15,611,The utter ruin plotting of your lives.
400,15,612,Keep in firm thought then ev’ry word that strives
400,15,613,For dang’rous utt’rance. Haste your ship’s full freight
400,15,614,"Of what you traffic for, and let me straight"
400,15,615,"Know by some sent friend she hath all in hold,"
400,15,616,And with myself I’ll bring thence all the gold
400,15,617,"I can by all means finger; and, beside,"
400,15,618,I’ll do my best to see your freight supplied
400,15,619,With some well - weighing burthen of mine own.
400,15,620,"For I bring - up in house a great man’s son,"
400,15,621,"As crafty as myself, who will with me"
400,15,622,"Run ev’ry way along, and I will be"
400,15,623,"His leader, till your ship hath made him sure."
400,15,624,"He will an infinite great price procure,"
400,15,625,Transfer him to what languag’d men ye may.’
400,15,626,"This said, she gat her home, and there made stay"
400,15,627,"A whole year with us, goods of great avail"
400,15,628,"Their ship enriching. Which now fit for sail,"
400,15,629,They sent a messenger t’ inform the dame;
400,15,630,"And to my father’s house a fellow came,"
400,15,631,"Full of Phœnician craft, that to be sold"
400,15,632,"A tablet brought, the body all of gold,"
400,15,633,The verge all - amber. This had ocular view
400,15,634,Both by my honour’d mother and the crew
400,15,635,"Of her house - handmaids, handled, and the price"
400,15,636,"Beat, ask’d, and promis’d. And while this device"
400,15,637,"Lay thus upon the forge, this jeweller"
400,15,638,"Made privy signs, by winks and wiles, to her"
400,15,639,"That was his object; which she took, and he,"
400,15,640,"His sign seeing noted, hied to ship. When she,"
400,15,641,"(My hand still taking, as she us’d to do"
400,15,642,To walk abroad with her) convey’d me so
400,15,643,"Abroad with her, and in the portico"
400,15,644,"Found cups, with tasted viands, which the guests"
400,15,645,That us’d to flock about my father’s feasts
400,15,646,"Had left. They gone (some to the council - court,"
400,15,647,Some to hear news amongst the talking sort)
400,15,648,"Her theft three bowls into her lap convey’d,"
400,15,649,And forth she went. Nor was my wit so stay’d
400,15,650,"To stay her, or myself. The sun went down,"
400,15,651,"And shadows round about the world were flown,"
400,15,652,"When we came to the haven, in which did ride"
400,15,653,The swift Phœnician ship; whose fair broad side
400,15,654,"They boarded straight, took us up; and all went"
400,15,655,Along the moist waves. Wind Saturnius sent.
400,15,656,Six days we day and night sail’d; but when Jove
400,15,657,"Put up the seventh day, She that shafts doth love"
400,15,658,"Shot dead the woman, who into the pump"
400,15,659,"Like to a dop - chick div’d, and gave a thump"
400,15,660,In her sad settling. Forth they cast her then
400,15,661,"To serve the fish and sea - calves, no more men;"
400,15,662,But I was left there with a heavy heart;
400,15,663,When wind and water drave them quit apart
400,15,664,"Their own course, and on Ithaca they fell,"
400,15,665,And there poor me did to Laertes sell.
400,15,666,And thus these eyes the sight of this isle prov’d.”
400,15,667,"“Eumæus,” he replied, “thou much hast mov’d"
400,15,668,"The mind in me with all things thou hast said,"
400,15,669,"And all the suff’rance on thy bosom laid,"
400,15,670,"But, truly, to thy ill hath Jove join’d good,"
400,15,671,That one whose veins are serv’d with human blood
400,15,672,"Hath bought thy service, that gives competence"
400,15,673,"Of food, wine, cloth to thee; and sure th’ expence"
400,15,674,"Of thy life’s date here is of good desert,"
400,15,675,Whose labours not to thee alone impart
400,15,676,"Sufficient food and housing, but to me;"
400,15,677,Where I through many a heap’d humanity
400,15,678,"Have hither err’d, where, though, like thee, not sold,"
400,15,679,"Nor stay’d like thee yet, nor nought needful hold.”"
400,15,680,"This mutual speech they us’d, nor had they slept"
400,15,681,Much time before the much - near morning leapt
400,15,682,To her fair throne. And now struck sail the men
400,15,683,"That serv’d Telemachus, arriv’d just then"
400,15,684,"Near his lov’d shore; where now they stoop’d the mast,"
400,15,685,"Made to the port with oars, and anchor cast,"
400,15,686,"Made fast the ship, and then ashore they went,"
400,15,687,"Dress’d supper, fill’d wine; when (their appetites spent)"
400,15,688,Telemachus commanded they should yield
400,15,689,"The ship to th’ owner, while himself at field"
400,15,690,Would see his shepherds; when light drew to end
400,15,691,"He would his gifts see, and to town descend,"
400,15,692,And in the morning at a feast bestow
400,15,693,"Rewards for all their pains. “And whither, now,”"
400,15,694,"Said Theoclymenus, “my lovéd son,"
400,15,695,"Shall I address myself? Whose mansión,"
400,15,696,"Of all men, in this rough - hewn isle, shall I"
400,15,697,Direct my way to? Or go readily
400,15,698,To thy house and thy mother?” He replied:
400,15,699,“Another time I’ll see you satisfied
400,15,700,"With my house - entertainment, but as now"
400,15,701,You should encounter none that could bestow
400,15,702,"Your fit entreaty, and (which less grace were)"
400,15,703,"You could not see my mother, I not there;"
400,15,704,"For she’s no frequent object, but apart"
400,15,705,"Keeps from her Wooers, woo’d with her desert,"
400,15,706,"Up in her chamber, at her housewif’ry"
400,15,707,But I’ll name one to whom you shall apply
400,15,708,"Direct repair, and that’s Eurymachus,"
400,15,709,"Renown’d descent to wise Polybius,"
400,15,710,A man whom th’ Ithacensians look on now
400,15,711,"As on a God, since he of all that woo"
400,15,712,"Is far superior man, and likest far"
400,15,713,"To wed my mother, and as circular"
400,15,714,Be in that honour as Ulysses was.
400,15,715,But heav’n - hous’d Jove knows the yet hidden pass
400,15,716,"Of her disposure, and on them he may"
400,15,717,A blacker sight bring than her nuptial day.”
400,15,718,"As this he utter’d, on his right hand flew"
400,15,719,"A saker, sacred to the God of view,"
400,15,720,That in his talons truss’d and plum’d a dove;
400,15,721,"The feathers round about the ship did rove,"
400,15,722,And on Telemachus fell; whom th’ augur then
400,15,723,"Took fast by the hand, withdrew him from his men,"
400,15,724,And said: “Telemachus! This hawk is sent
400,15,725,From God; I knew it for a sure ostent
400,15,726,"When first I saw it. Be you well assur’d,"
400,15,727,There will no Wooer be by heav’n endur’d
400,15,728,"To rule in Ithaca above your race,"
400,15,729,But your pow’rs ever fill the regal place.”
400,15,730,"“I wish to heav’n,” said he, “thy word might stand,"
400,15,731,Thou then shouldst soon acknowledge from my hand
400,15,732,"Such gifts and friendship, as would make thee, guest,"
400,15,733,Met and saluted as no less than blest.”
400,15,734,"This said, he call’d Piræus, Clytus’ son,"
400,15,735,"His true associate, saying: “Thou hast done"
400,15,736,(Of all my followers to the Pylian shore)
400,15,737,"My will in chief in other things, once more"
400,15,738,Be chiefly good to me; take to thy house
400,15,739,"This lovéd stranger, and be studious"
400,15,740,"T’ embrace and greet him with thy greatest fare,"
400,15,741,Till I myself come and take off thy care.”
400,15,742,The famous - for - his - lance said: “If your stay
400,15,743,"Take time for life here, this man’s care I’ll lay"
400,15,744,"On my performance, nor what fits a guest"
400,15,745,Shall any penury withhold his feast.”
400,15,746,"Thus took he ship, bade them board, and away."
400,15,747,"They boarded, sat, but did their labour stay"
400,15,748,"Till he had deck’d his feet, and reached his lance."
400,15,749,They to the city; he did straight advance
400,15,750,"Up to his styes, where swine lay for him store,"
400,15,751,"By whose side did his honest swine - herd snore,"
400,15,752,"Till his short cares his longest nights had ended,"
400,15,753,And nothing worse to both his lords intended.

400,16,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,16,2,"The Prince at field, he sends to town"
400,16,3,"Eumæus, to make truly known"
400,16,4,"His safe return. By Pallas’ will,"
400,16,5,Telemachus is giv’n the skill
400,16,6,To know his father. Those that lay
400,16,7,"In ambush, to prevent the way"
400,16,8,"Of young Ulyssides for home,"
400,16,9,"Retire, with anger overcome."
400,16,10,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,16,11,_Πι̑._
400,16,12,To his most dear
400,16,13,Ulysses shows.
400,16,14,The wise - son here
400,16,15,His father knows.
400,16,16,Ulysses and divine Eumæus rose
400,16,17,"Soon as the morning could her eyes unclose,"
400,16,18,"Made fire, brake fast, and to their pasture send"
400,16,19,"The gather’d herds, on whom their swains attend."
400,16,20,"The self - tire barking dogs all fawn’d upon,"
400,16,21,"Nor bark’d, at first sight of Ulysses’ son."
400,16,22,The whinings of their fawnings yet did greet
400,16,23,"Ulysses’ ears, and sounds of certain feet,"
400,16,24,"Who thus bespake Eumæus: “Sure some friend,"
400,16,25,"Or one well - known, comes, that the mastiffs spend"
400,16,26,Their mouths no louder. Only some one near
400,16,27,"They whine, and leap about, whose feet I hear.”"
400,16,28,"Each word of this speech was not spent, before"
400,16,29,His son stood in the entry of the door.
400,16,30,"Out - rush’d amaz’d Eumæus, and let go"
400,16,31,"The cup to earth, that he had labour’d so,"
400,16,32,"Cleans’d for the neat wine, did the prince - surprise,"
400,16,33,"Kiss’d his fair forehead, both his lovely eyes,"
400,16,34,"Both his white hands, and tender tears distill’d."
400,16,35,There breath’d no kind - soul’d father that was fill’d
400,16,36,"Less with his son’s embraces, that had liv’d"
400,16,37,"Ten years in far - off earth, now new retriev’d,"
400,16,38,"His only child too, gotten in his age,"
400,16,39,And for whose absence he had felt the rage
400,16,40,"Of griefs upon him, than for this divin’d"
400,16,41,So - much - for - form was this divine - for - mind;
400,16,42,"Who kiss’d him through, who grew about him kissing,"
400,16,43,"As fresh from death ’scap’d. Whom so long time missing,"
400,16,44,"He wept for joy, and said: “Thou yet art come,"
400,16,45,"Sweet light, sweet sun - rise, to thy cloudy home."
400,16,46,"O, never I look’d, when once shipp’d away"
400,16,47,"For Pylos’ shores, to see thy turning day."
400,16,48,"Come, enter, lov’d son, let me feast my heart"
400,16,49,"With thy sweet sight, new - come, so far apart."
400,16,50,"Nor, when you liv’d at home, would you walk down"
400,16,51,"Often enough here, but stay’d still at town;"
400,16,52,It pleas’d you then to cast such forehand view
400,16,53,About your house on that most damnéd crew.”[1]
400,16,54,"“It shall be so then, friend,” said he, “but now"
400,16,55,"I come to glad mine eyes with thee, and know"
400,16,56,"If still my mother in her house remain,"
400,16,57,Or if some Wooer hath aspir’d to gain
400,16,58,"Of her in nuptials; for Ulysses’ bed,"
400,16,59,"By this, lies all with spiders’s cobwebs spread,"
400,16,60,In penury of him that should supply it.”
400,16,61,"“She still,” said he, “holds her most constant quiet,"
400,16,62,"Aloft thine own house, for the bed’s respect;"
400,16,63,"But, for her lord’s sad loss, sad nights and days"
400,16,64,"Obscure her beauties, and corrupt their rays.”"
400,16,65,"This said, Eumæus took his brazen spear,"
400,16,66,"And in he went; when, being enter’d near"
400,16,67,Within the stony threshold; from his seat
400,16,68,"His father rose to him, who would not let"
400,16,69,"Th’ old man remove, but drew him back and prest"
400,16,70,"With earnest terms his sitting, saying: “Guest,"
400,16,71,"Take here your seat again, we soon shall get"
400,16,72,Within our own house here some other seat.
400,16,73,"Here’s one will fetch it.” This said, down again"
400,16,74,"His father sat, and to his son his swain"
400,16,75,"Strew’d fair green osiers, and impos’d thereon"
400,16,76,"A good soft sheepskin, which made him a throne."
400,16,77,"Then he appos’d to them his last - left roast,"
400,16,78,"And in a wicker basket bread engrost,"
400,16,79,"Fill’d luscious wine, and then took opposite seat"
400,16,80,"To the divine Ulysses. When, the meat"
400,16,81,"Set there before them, all fell - to, and eat."
400,16,82,"When they had fed, the prince said: “Pray thee say,"
400,16,83,Whence comes this guest? What seaman gave him way
400,16,84,To this our isle? I hope these feet of his
400,16,85,Could walk no water. Who boasts he he is?”
400,16,86,“I’ll tell all truly son: From ample Crete
400,16,87,"He boasts himself, and says, his erring feet"
400,16,88,"Have many cities trod, and God was he"
400,16,89,Whose finger wrought in his infirmity.
400,16,90,"But, to my cottage, the last ’scape of his"
400,16,91,"Was from a Thesprot’s ship. Whate’er he is,"
400,16,92,"I’ll give him you, do what you please; his vaunt"
400,16,93,"Is, that he is, at most, a suppliant.”"
400,16,94,"“Eumæus,” said the prince, “to tell me this,"
400,16,95,You have afflicted my weak faculties;
400,16,96,For how shall I receive him to my house
400,16,97,"With any safety, that suspicious"
400,16,98,Of my young forces (should I be assay’d
400,16,99,With any sudden violence) may want aid
400,16,100,"To shield myself? Besides, if I go home,"
400,16,101,"My mother is with two doubts overcome,"
400,16,102,"If she shall stay with me, and take fit care"
400,16,103,"For all such guests as there seek guestive fare,"
400,16,104,"Her husband’s bed respecting, and her fame"
400,16,105,Amongst the people; or her blood may frame
400,16,106,"A liking to some Wooer, such as best"
400,16,107,"May bed her in his house, not giving least."
400,16,108,And thus am I unsure of all means free
400,16,109,"To use a guest there, fit for his degree."
400,16,110,"But, being thy guest, I’ll be his supply"
400,16,111,"For all weeds, such as mere necessity"
400,16,112,"Shall more than furnish. Fit him with a sword,"
400,16,113,And set him where his heart would have been shor’d;
400,16,114,"Or, if so pleas’d, receive him in thy shed,"
400,16,115,"I’ll send thee clothes, I vow, and all the bread"
400,16,116,"His wish would eat, that to thy men and thee"
400,16,117,He be no burthen. But that I should be
400,16,118,His mean to my house; where a company
400,16,119,"Of wrong - professing Wooers wildly live,"
400,16,120,"I will in no sort author, lest they give"
400,16,121,"Foul use to him, and me as gravely grieve."
400,16,122,For what great act can anyone achieve
400,16,123,"Against a multitude, although his mind"
400,16,124,Retain a courage of the greatest kind?
400,16,125,For all minds have not force in one degree.”
400,16,126,"Ulysses answer’d: “O friend, since ’tis free"
400,16,127,"For any man to change fit words with thee,"
400,16,128,"I’ll freely speak: Methinks, a wolfish pow’r"
400,16,129,"My heart puts on to tear and to devour,"
400,16,130,"To hear your affirmation, that, in spite"
400,16,131,"Of what may fall on you, made opposite,"
400,16,132,"Being one of your proportion, birth, and age,"
400,16,133,These Wooers should in such injustice rage.
400,16,134,What should the cause be? Do you wilfully
400,16,135,Endure their spoil? Or hath your empery
400,16,136,"Been such amongst your people, that all gather"
400,16,137,"In troop, and one voice (which ev’n God doth father)"
400,16,138,"And vow your hate so, that they suffer them?"
400,16,139,"Or blame your kinsfolk’s faiths, before th’ extreme"
400,16,140,"Of your first stroke hath tried them, whom a man,"
400,16,141,"When strifes to blows rise, trusts, though battle ran"
400,16,142,In huge and high waves? Would to heav’n my spirit
400,16,143,"Such youth breath’d, as the man that must inherit"
400,16,144,"Yet - never - touch’d Ulysses, or that he,"
400,16,145,"But wand’ring this way, would but come, and see"
400,16,146,What my age could achieve (and there is Fate
400,16,147,"For Hope yet left, that he may recreate"
400,16,148,His eyes with such an object) this my head
400,16,149,"Should any stranger strike off, if stark dead"
400,16,150,"I struck not all, the house in open force"
400,16,151,Ent’ring with challenge! If their great concourse
400,16,152,"Did over - lay me, being a man alone,"
400,16,153,"(Which you urge for yourself) be you that one,"
400,16,154,I rather in mine own house wish to die
400,16,155,"One death for all, than so indecently"
400,16,156,"See evermore deeds worse than death applied,"
400,16,157,"Guests wrong’d with vile words and blow - giving pride,"
400,16,158,The women - servants dragg’d in filthy kind
400,16,159,"About the fair house, and in corners blind"
400,16,160,"Made serve the rapes of ruffians, food devour’d"
400,16,161,"Idly and rudely, wine exhaust, and pour’d"
400,16,162,Through throats profane; and all about a deed
400,16,163,"That’s ever wooing, and will never speed.”"
400,16,164,"“I’ll tell you, guest, most truly,” said his son,"
400,16,165,“I do not think that all my people run
400,16,166,One hateful course against me; nor accuse
400,16,167,Kinsfolks that I in strifes of weight might use;
400,16,168,"But Jove will have it so, our race alone"
400,16,169,(As if made singular) to one and one
400,16,170,"His hand confining. Only to the king,"
400,16,171,"Jove - bred Arcesius, did Laertes spring;"
400,16,172,Only to old Laertes did descend
400,16,173,Ulysses; only to Ulysses’ end
400,16,174,"Am I the adjunct, whom he left so young,"
400,16,175,That from me to him never comfort sprung.
400,16,176,"And to all these now, for their race, arise"
400,16,177,Up in their house a brood of enemies.
400,16,178,"As many as in these isles bow men’s knees,"
400,16,179,"Samos, Dulichius, and the rich - in - trees"
400,16,180,"Zacynthus, or in this rough isle’s command,"
400,16,181,"So many suitors for the nuptials stand,"
400,16,182,"That ask my mother, and, mean space, prefer"
400,16,183,"Their lusts to all spoil, that dishonour her."
400,16,184,"Nor doth she, though she loaths, deny their suits,"
400,16,185,"Nor they denials take, though taste their fruits."
400,16,186,But all this time the state of all things there
400,16,187,"Their throats devour, and I must shortly bear"
400,16,188,A part in all. And yet the periods
400,16,189,Of these designs lie in the knees of Gods.
400,16,190,"Of all loves then, Eumæus, make quick way"
400,16,191,"To wise Penelopé, and to her say"
400,16,192,"My safe return from Pylos, and alone,"
400,16,193,"Return thou hither, having made it known."
400,16,194,"Nor let, besides my mother, any ear"
400,16,195,"Partake thy message, since a number bear"
400,16,196,My safe return displeasure.” He replied;
400,16,197,"“I know, and comprehend you. You divide"
400,16,198,Your mind with one that understands you well.
400,16,199,"But, all in one yet, may I not reveal"
400,16,200,To th’ old hard - fated Arcesiades
400,16,201,"Your safe return? Who, through his whole distress"
400,16,202,"Felt for Ulysses, did not yet so grieve,"
400,16,203,"But with his household he had will to live,"
400,16,204,"And serv’d his appetite with wine and food,"
400,16,205,"Survey’d his husbandry, and did his blood"
400,16,206,Some comforts fitting life; but since you took
400,16,207,"Your ship for Pylos, he would never brook"
400,16,208,"Or wine or food, they say, nor cast an eye"
400,16,209,"On any labour, but sits weeping by,"
400,16,210,"And sighing out his sorrows, ceaseless moans"
400,16,211,"Wasting his body, turn’d all skin and bones.”"
400,16,212,"“More sad news still,” said he, “yet, mourn he still;"
400,16,213,"For if the rule of all men’s works be will,"
400,16,214,"And his will his way goes, mine stands inclin’d"
400,16,215,T’ attend the home - turn of my nearer kind.[2]
400,16,216,"Do then what I enjoin; which giv’n effect,"
400,16,217,"Err nor to field to him, but turn direct,"
400,16,218,"Entreating first my mother, with most speed,"
400,16,219,"And all the secrecy that now serves need,"
400,16,220,"To send this way their store - house guardian,"
400,16,221,And she shall tell all to the aged man.”[3]
400,16,222,"He took his shoes up, put them on, and went."
400,16,223,"Nor was his absence hid from Jove’s descent,"
400,16,224,"Divine Minerva, who took straight to view,"
400,16,225,"A goodly woman’s shape that all works knew,"
400,16,226,"And, standing in the entry, did prefer"
400,16,227,"Her sight t’ Ulysses; but, though meeting her,"
400,16,228,His son Telemachus nor saw nor knew.
400,16,229,_The Gods’ clear presences are know to few._
400,16,230,"Yet, with Ulysses, ev’n the dogs did see,"
400,16,231,"And would not bark, but, whining lovingly,"
400,16,232,Fled to the stall’s far side. When she her eyne
400,16,233,"Mov’d to Ulysses; he knew her design,"
400,16,234,"And left the house, pass’d the great sheep - cote’s wall,"
400,16,235,And stood before her. She bade utter all
400,16,236,"Now to his son, nor keep the least unlos’d,"
400,16,237,"That, all the Wooers’ deaths being now dispos’d,"
400,16,238,They might approach the town; affirming; she
400,16,239,Not long would fail t’ assist to victory.
400,16,240,"This said, she laid her golden rod on him,"
400,16,241,"And with his late - worn weeds grac’d ev’ry limb,"
400,16,242,"His body straighten’d, and his youth instill’d,"
400,16,243,"His fresh blood call’d up, ev’ry wrinkle fill’d"
400,16,244,"About his broken eyes, and on his chin"
400,16,245,"The brown hair spread. When his whole trim wrought in,"
400,16,246,"She issued, and he enter’d to his son,"
400,16,247,"Who stood amaz’d, and thought some God had done"
400,16,248,"His house that honour, turn’d away his eyes,"
400,16,249,"And said; “Now guest, you grace another guise"
400,16,250,"Than suits your late show. Other weeds you wear,"
400,16,251,And other person. Of the starry sphere
400,16,252,You certainly present some deathless God.
400,16,253,"Be pleas’d, that to your here - vouchsaf’d abode"
400,16,254,"We may give sacred rites, and offer gold,"
400,16,255,To do us favour.” He replied; “I hold
400,16,256,No deified state. Why put you thus on me
400,16,257,A God’s resemblance? I am only he
400,16,258,That bears thy father’s name; for whose lov’d sake
400,16,259,"Thy youth so grieves, whose absence makes thee take"
400,16,260,"Such wrongs of men.” Thus kiss’d he him, nor could"
400,16,261,Forbear those tears that in such mighty hold
400,16,262,"He held before, still held, still issuing ever;"
400,16,263,"And now, the shores once broke, the springtide never"
400,16,264,"Forbore earth from the cheeks he kiss’d. His son,"
400,16,265,By all these violent arguments not won
400,16,266,"To credit him his father, did deny"
400,16,267,"His kind assumpt, and said, some Deity"
400,16,268,"Feign’d that joy’s cause, to make him grieve the more;"
400,16,269,"Affirming, that no man, whoever wore"
400,16,270,"The garment of mortality, could take,"
400,16,271,"By any utmost pow’r his soul could make,"
400,16,272,"Such change into it, since, at so much will,"
400,16,273,Not Jove himself could both remove and fill
400,16,274,"Old age with youth, and youth with age so spoil,"
400,16,275,In such an instant. “You wore all the soil
400,16,276,"Of age but now, and were old; and but now"
400,16,277,You bear that young grace that the Gods indow
400,16,278,Their heav’n - born forms withal.” His father said:
400,16,279,"“Telemachus! Admire, nor stand dismay’d,"
400,16,280,But know thy solid father; since within
400,16,281,He answers all parts that adorn his skin.
400,16,282,There shall no more Ulyssesses come here.
400,16,283,"I am the man, that now this twentieth year"
400,16,284,(Still under suff’rance of a world of ill)
400,16,285,My country - earth recover. ’Tis the will
400,16,286,"The prey - professor Pallas puts in act,"
400,16,287,"Who put me thus together, thus distract"
400,16,288,"In aged pieces as ev’n now you saw,"
400,16,289,This youth now rend’ring. ’Tis within the law
400,16,290,"Of her free pow’r. Sometimes to show me poor,"
400,16,291,Sometimes again thus amply to restore
400,16,292,"My youth and ornaments, she still would please."
400,16,293,"_The Gods can raise, and throw men down, with ease.”_"
400,16,294,"This said, he sat; when his Telemachus pour’d"
400,16,295,"Himself about him; tears on tears he show’r’d,"
400,16,296,And to desire of moan increas’d the cloud.
400,16,297,"Both wept and howl’d, and laid out shrieks more loud"
400,16,298,"Than or the bird - bone - breaking eagle rears,"
400,16,299,"Or brood - kind vulture with the crooked seres,"
400,16,300,"When rustic hands their tender eyries draw,"
400,16,301,Before they give their wings their full - plum’d law.
400,16,302,But miserably pour’d they from beneath
400,16,303,"Their lids their tears, while both their breasts did breathe"
400,16,304,"As frequent cries; and, to their fervent moan,"
400,16,305,"The light had left the skies, if first the son"
400,16,306,"Their dumb moans had not vented, with demand"
400,16,307,What ship it was that gave the natural land
400,16,308,To his bless’d feet? He then did likewise lay
400,16,309,"Hand on his passion, and gave these words way:"
400,16,310,"“I’ll tell thee truth, my son: The men that bear"
400,16,311,"Much fame for shipping, my reducers were"
400,16,312,"To long - wish’d Ithaca, who each man else"
400,16,313,That greets their shore give pass to where he dwells.
400,16,314,"The Phæacensian peers, in one night’s date,"
400,16,315,"While I fast slept, fetch’d th’ Ithacensian state,"
400,16,316,"Grac’d me with wealthy gifts, brass, store of gold,"
400,16,317,And robes fair - wrought; all which have secret hold
400,16,318,In caves that by the Gods’ advice I chus’d.
400,16,319,And now Minerva’s admonitions us’d
400,16,320,"For this retreat, that we might here dispose"
400,16,321,In close discourse the slaughters of our foes.
400,16,322,"Recount the number of the Wooers then,"
400,16,323,"And let me know what name they hold with men,"
400,16,324,That my mind may cast over their estates
400,16,325,"A curious measure, and confer the rates"
400,16,326,"Of our two pow’rs and theirs, to try, if we"
400,16,327,Alone may propagate to victory
400,16,328,"Our bold encounters of them all, or prove"
400,16,329,The kind assistance of some others’ love.”
400,16,330,"“O father,” he replied, “I oft have heard"
400,16,331,Your counsels and your force of hand preferr’d
400,16,332,"To mighty glory, but your speeches now"
400,16,333,Your vent’rous mind exceeding mighty show.
400,16,334,"Ev’n to amaze they move me; for, in right"
400,16,335,"Of no fit counsel, should be brought to fight"
400,16,336,Two men ’gainst th’ able faction of a throng.
400,16,337,"No one two, no one ten, no twice ten, strong"
400,16,338,"These Wooers are, but more by much. For know,"
400,16,339,"That from Dulichius there are fifty - two,"
400,16,340,All choice young men; and ev’ry one of these
400,16,341,Six men attend. From Samos cross’d the seas
400,16,342,Twice - twelve young gallants. From Zacynthus came
400,16,343,"Twice - ten. Of Ithaca, the best of name,"
400,16,344,Twice - six. Of all which all the state they take
400,16,345,A sacred poet and a herald make.
400,16,346,"Their delicacies two, of special sort"
400,16,347,"In skill of banquets, serve. And all this port"
400,16,348,"If we shall dare t’ encounter, all - thrust - up"
400,16,349,"In one strong roof, have great care lest the cup,"
400,16,350,"Your great mind thirsts, exceeding bitter taste,"
400,16,351,And your retreat commend not to your haste
400,16,352,"Your great attempt, but make you say, you buy"
400,16,353,Their pride’s revenges at a price too high.
400,16,354,"And therefore, if you could; ’twere well you thought"
400,16,355,Of some assistant. Be your spirit wrought
400,16,356,"In such a man’s election, as may lend"
400,16,357,"His succours freely, and express a friend.”"
400,16,358,His father answer’d: “Let me ask of thee;
400,16,359,"Hear me, consider, and then answer me."
400,16,360,"Think’st thou, if Pallas and the King of skies"
400,16,361,"We had to friend, would their sufficiencies"
400,16,362,Make strong our part? Or that some other yet
400,16,363,"My thoughts must work for?” “These,” said he “are set"
400,16,364,"Aloft the clouds, and are found aids indeed,"
400,16,365,"As pow’rs not only that these men exceed,"
400,16,366,"But bear of all men else the high command,"
400,16,367,And hold of Gods an overruling hand.”
400,16,368,"“Well then,” said he, “not these shall sever long"
400,16,369,Their force and ours in fights assur’d and strong.
400,16,370,And then ’twixt us and them shall Mars prefer
400,16,371,"His strength, to stand our great distinguisher,"
400,16,372,When in mine own roofs I am forc’d to blows.
400,16,373,"But when the day shall first her fires disclose,"
400,16,374,"Go thou for home, and troop up with the Wooers,"
400,16,375,"Thy will with theirs join’d, pow’r with their rude pow’rs;"
400,16,376,And after shall the herdsman guide to town
400,16,377,"My steps, my person wholly overgrown"
400,16,378,"With all appearance of a poor old swain,"
400,16,379,"Heavy, and wretched. If their high disdain"
400,16,380,Of my vile presence make them my desert
400,16,381,"Affect with contumelies, let thy lov’d heart"
400,16,382,"Beat in fix’d cónfines of thy bosom still,"
400,16,383,"And see me suffer, patient of their ill."
400,16,384,"Ay, though they drag me by the heels about"
400,16,385,"Mine own free earth, and after hurl me out,"
400,16,386,"Do thou still suffer. Nay, though with their darts"
400,16,387,"They beat and bruise me, bear. But these foul parts"
400,16,388,"Persuade them to forbear, and by their names"
400,16,389,"Call all with kind words; bidding, for their shames,"
400,16,390,"Their pleasures cease. If yet they yield not way,"
400,16,391,There breaks the first light of their fatal day.
400,16,392,"In mean space, mark this: When the chiefly - wise"
400,16,393,"Minerva prompts me, I’ll inform thine eyes"
400,16,394,"With some giv’n sign, and then all th’ arms that are"
400,16,395,Aloft thy roof in some near room prepare
400,16,396,For speediest use. If those brave men inquire
400,16,397,"Thy end in all, still rake up all thy fire"
400,16,398,"In fair cool words, and say: ‘I bring them down"
400,16,399,"To scour the smoke off, being so overgrown"
400,16,400,"That one would think all fumes, that ever were"
400,16,401,"Breath’d since Ulysses’ loss, reflected here."
400,16,402,"These are not like the arms he left behind,"
400,16,403,"In way for Troy. Besides, Jove prompts my mind"
400,16,404,"In their remove apart thus with this thought,"
400,16,405,"That, if in height of wine there should be wrought,"
400,16,406,"Some harsh contention ’twixt you, this apt mean"
400,16,407,To mutual bloodshed may be taken clean
400,16,408,"From out your reach, and all the spoil prevented"
400,16,409,"Of present feast, perhaps ev’n then presented"
400,16,410,My mother’s nuptials to your long kind vows.
400,16,411,"_Steel itself, ready, draws a man to blows.’_"
400,16,412,Thus make their thoughts secure; to us alone
400,16,413,"Two swords, two darts, two shields left: which see done"
400,16,414,"Within our readiest reach, that at our will"
400,16,415,"We may resume, and charge, and all their skill"
400,16,416,"Pallas and Jove, that all just counsels breathe,"
400,16,417,May darken with secureness to their death.
400,16,418,"And let me charge thee now, as thou art mine,"
400,16,419,And as thy veins mine own true blood combine:
400,16,420,"Let, after this, none know Ulysses near,"
400,16,421,"Not anyone of all the household there,"
400,16,422,"Not here the herdsman, not Laertes be"
400,16,423,"Made privy, not herself Penelopé"
400,16,424,But only let thyself and me work out
400,16,425,The women’s thoughts of all things borne about
400,16,426,"The Wooers’ hearts; and then thy men approve,"
400,16,427,"To know who honours, who with rev’rence love,"
400,16,428,"Our well - weigh’d memories, and who is won"
400,16,429,"To fail thy fit right, though my only son.”"
400,16,430,"“You teach,” said he, “so punctually now,"
400,16,431,"As I knew nothing, nor were sprung from you."
400,16,432,"I hope, hereafter, you shall better know"
400,16,433,"What soul I bear, and that it doth not let"
400,16,434,The least loose motion pass his natural seat.
400,16,435,"But this course you propose will prove, I fear,"
400,16,436,Small profit to us; and could wish your care
400,16,437,Would weigh it better as too far about.
400,16,438,"For time will ask much, to the sifting out"
400,16,439,Of each man’s disposition by his deeds;
400,16,440,"And, in the mean time, ev’ry Wooer feeds"
400,16,441,"Beyond satiety, nor knows how to spare."
400,16,442,"The women yet, since they more easy are"
400,16,443,"For our inquiry, I would wish you try,"
400,16,444,"Who right your state, who do it injury."
400,16,445,"The men I would omit, and these things make"
400,16,446,"Your labour after. But, to undertake"
400,16,447,"The Wooers’ war, I wish your utmost speed,"
400,16,448,Especially if you could cheer the deed
400,16,449,"With some ostent from Jove.” Thus, as the sire"
400,16,450,"Consented to the son, did here expire"
400,16,451,"Their mutual speech. And now the ship was come,"
400,16,452,"That brought the young prince and his soldiers home,"
400,16,453,"The deep haven reach’d, they drew the ship ashore,"
400,16,454,"Took all their arms out, and the rich gifts bore"
400,16,455,To Clitius’ house. But to Ulysses’ court
400,16,456,"They sent a herald first, to make report"
400,16,457,"To wise Penelopé, that safe at field"
400,16,458,"Her son was left; yet, since the ship would yield"
400,16,459,"Most haste to her, he sent that first, and them"
400,16,460,To comfort with his utmost the extreme
400,16,461,He knew she suffer’d. At the court now met
400,16,462,"The herald and the herdsman, to repeat"
400,16,463,One message to the queen. Both whom arriv’d
400,16,464,Within the gates; both to be foremost striv’d
400,16,465,"In that good news. The herald, he for haste"
400,16,466,"Amongst the maids bestow’d it, thinking plac’d"
400,16,467,"The queen amongst them. “Now,” said he, “O queen,"
400,16,468,"Your lov’d son is arriv’d.” And, then was seen"
400,16,469,"The queen herself, to whom the herdsman told"
400,16,470,All that Telemachus enjoin’d he should;
400,16,471,"All which discharg’d, his steps he back bestows,"
400,16,472,And left both court and city for his sows.
400,16,473,"The Wooers then grew sad; soul - vex’d, and all"
400,16,474,"Made forth the court; when, by the mighty wall"
400,16,475,"They took their sev’ral seats, before the gates."
400,16,476,To whom Eurymachus initiates.
400,16,477,"Their utter’d grievance. “O,” said he, “my friends,"
400,16,478,"A work right - great begun, as proudly ends,"
400,16,479,"We said, Telemachus should never make"
400,16,480,"His voyage good, nor this shore ever take"
400,16,481,"For his return’s receipt; and yet we fail,"
400,16,482,"And he performs it. Come, let’s man a sail,"
400,16,483,"The best In our election, and bestow"
400,16,484,"Such soldiers in her as can swiftest row,"
400,16,485,To tell our friends that way - lay his retreat
400,16,486,"‘Tis safe perform’d, and make them quickly get"
400,16,487,Their ship for Ithaca.” This was not said
400,16,488,Before Amphinomus in port display’d
400,16,489,"The ship arriv’d, her sails then under - stroke,"
400,16,490,"And oars resum’d; when, laughing, thus he spoke:"
400,16,491,"“Move for no messenger. These men are come,"
400,16,492,"Some God hath either told his turning home,"
400,16,493,"Or they themselves have seen his ship gone by,"
400,16,494,"Had her in chase, and lost her.” Instantly"
400,16,495,"They rose, and went to port; found drawn to land"
400,16,496,"The ship, the soldiers taking arms in hand."
400,16,497,"The Wooers themselves to council went in throng,"
400,16,498,"And not a man besides, or old, or young,"
400,16,499,"Let sit amongst them. Then Eupitheus’ son,"
400,16,500,"Antinous, said: “See, what the Gods have done!"
400,16,501,They only have deliver’d from our ill
400,16,502,The men we way - laid. Ev’ry windy hill
400,16,503,"Hath been their watch - tow’r, where by turns they stood"
400,16,504,Continual sentinel. And we made good
400,16,505,"Our work as well, for, sun once set, we never"
400,16,506,"Slept wink ashore all night, but made sail ever,"
400,16,507,"This way and that, ev’n till the morning kept"
400,16,508,"Her sacred station, so to intercept"
400,16,509,"And take his life, for whom our ambush lay;"
400,16,510,And yet hath God to his return giv’n way.
400,16,511,But let us prosecute with counsels here
400,16,512,"His necessary death, nor anywhere"
400,16,513,"Let rest his safety; for if he survive,"
400,16,514,Our sails will never - in wish’d havens arrive;
400,16,515,"Since he is wise, hath soul, and counsel too,"
400,16,516,"To work the people, who, will never do"
400,16,517,Our faction favour. What we then intend
400,16,518,"Against his person, give we present end,"
400,16,519,"Before he call a council, which, believe,"
400,16,520,"His spirit will haste, and point where it doth grieve,"
400,16,521,"Stand up amongst them all, and urge his death"
400,16,522,Decreed amongst us. Which complaint will breathe
400,16,523,"A fire about their spleens, and blow no praise"
400,16,524,"On our ill labours. Lest, they therefore raise"
400,16,525,"Pow’r to exile us from our native earth,"
400,16,526,And force our lives’ societies to the birth
400,16,527,"Of foreign countries, let our speeds prevent,"
400,16,528,"His coming home to this austere complaint,"
400,16,529,"At field and far from town, or in some way"
400,16,530,"Of narrow passage, with his latest day"
400,16,531,"Shown to his forward youth, his goods and lands"
400,16,532,"Left to the free division of our hands,"
400,16,533,"The moveables made all his mother’s dow’r,"
400,16,534,"And his, whoever Fate affords the pow’r"
400,16,535,"To celebrate, with her sweet Hymen’s rites."
400,16,536,"Or if this please not, but your appetites"
400,16,537,"Stand to his safety, and to give him seat"
400,16,538,"In his whole birth - right, let us look to eat"
400,16,539,"At his cost never more, but ev’ry man"
400,16,540,"Haste to his home, and wed, with whom he can"
400,16,541,"At home, and there lay first about for dow’r"
400,16,542,And then the woman give his second pow’r
400,16,543,"Of nuptial - liking, and, for last, apply"
400,16,544,His purpose with most gifts and destiny.”
400,16,545,"This silence caus’d; whose breach, at last, begun"
400,16,546,"Amphinomus, the much renownéd son"
400,16,547,"Of Nisus surnam’d Aretiades,"
400,16,548,Who from Dulichius full of flow’ry leas
400,16,549,"Led all the Wooers, and in chief did please"
400,16,550,"The queen with his discourse, because it grew"
400,16,551,From roots of those good minds that did endue[4]
400,16,552,"His goodly person; who, exceeding wise,"
400,16,553,"Us’d this speech: “Friends, I never will advise"
400,16,554,The prince’s death; for ’tis a damnéd thing
400,16,555,To put to death the issue of a king.
400,16,556,"First, therefore, let’s examine, what applause"
400,16,557,The Gods will give it: If the equal laws
400,16,558,"Of Jove approve it, I myself will be"
400,16,559,"The man shall kill him, and this company"
400,16,560,Exhort to that mind: If the Gods remain
400,16,561,"Adverse, and hate it, I advise, refrain.”"
400,16,562,"This said Amphinomus, and pleas’d them all"
400,16,563,"When all arose, and in Ulysses’ hall"
400,16,564,Took seat again. Then to the queen was come
400,16,565,"The Wooers’ plot, to kill her son at home,"
400,16,566,"Since their abroad - design had miss’d success,"
400,16,567,The herald Medon (who the whole address
400,16,568,Knew of their counsels) making the report.
400,16,569,"The Goddess of her sex, with her fair sort"
400,16,570,"Of lovely women, at the large hall’s door"
400,16,571,(Her bright cheeks clouded with a veil she wore)
400,16,572,"Stood, and directed to Antinous"
400,16,573,"Her sharp reproof, which she digested thus:"
400,16,574,“Antinous! Compos’d of injury!
400,16,575,Plotter of mischief! Though reports that fly
400,16,576,Amongst our Ithacensian people say
400,16,577,"That thou, of all that glory in their sway,"
400,16,578,"Art best in words and counsels, th’ art not so."
400,16,579,"Fond, busy fellow, why plott’st thou the woe"
400,16,580,"And slaughter of my son, and dost not fear"
400,16,581,"The presidents of suppliants, when the ear"
400,16,582,Of Jove stoops to them? ’Tis unjust to do
400,16,583,"Slaughter for slaughter, or pay woe for woe,"
400,16,584,"Mischief for kindness. Death for life sought, then,"
400,16,585,Is an injustice to be loath’d of men.
400,16,586,Serves not thy knowledge to remember when
400,16,587,Thy father fled to us? Who (mov’d to wrath
400,16,588,Against the Taphian thieves) pursued with scathe
400,16,589,"The guiltless Thesprots; in whose people’s fear,"
400,16,590,"Pursuing him for wreak, he landed here,"
400,16,591,"They after him, professing both their prize"
400,16,592,"Of all his chiefly - valued faculties,"
400,16,593,And more priz’d life. Of all whose bloodiest ends
400,16,594,"Ulysses curb’d them, though they were his friends."
400,16,595,"Yet thou, like one that no law will allow"
400,16,596,"The least true honour, eat’st his house up now"
400,16,597,"That fed thy father; woo’st for love his wife,"
400,16,598,Whom thus thou griev’st and seek’st her sole son’s life!
400,16,599,"Cease, I command thee, and command the rest"
400,16,600,To see all thought of these foul fashions ceas’d.”
400,16,601,"Eurymachus replied: “Be confident,"
400,16,602,"Thou all - of - wit - made, the most fam’d descent"
400,16,603,Of king Icarius. Free thy spirits of fear.
400,16,604,"There lives not anyone, nor shall live here"
400,16,605,"Now, nor hereafter, while my life gives heat"
400,16,606,"And light to me on earth, that dares intreat"
400,16,607,"With any ill touch thy well - lovéd son,"
400,16,608,"But here I vow, and here will see it done,"
400,16,609,His life shall stain my lance. If on his knees
400,16,610,"The city - racer, Laertiades,"
400,16,611,"Hath made me sit, put in my hand his food,"
400,16,612,"And held his red wine to me, shall the blood"
400,16,613,Of his Telemachus on my hand lay
400,16,614,"The least pollution, that my life can stay?"
400,16,615,No! I have ever charg’d him not to fear
400,16,616,"Death’s threat from any. And, for that most dear"
400,16,617,"Love of his father, he shall ever be"
400,16,618,Much the most lov’d of all that live to me.
400,16,619,"_Who kills a guiltless man from man may fly,"
400,16,620,From God his searches all escapes deny.”_
400,16,621,"Thus cheer’d his words, but his affections still"
400,16,622,Fear’d not to cherish foul intent to kill
400,16,623,Ev’n him whose life to all lives he preferr’d.
400,16,624,"The queen went up, and to her love appear’d"
400,16,625,"Her lord so freshly, that she wept, till sleep"
400,16,626,(By Pallas forc’d on her) her eyes did steep
400,16,627,"In his sweet humour. When the even was come,"
400,16,628,The God - like herdsman reach’d the whole way home.
400,16,629,Ulysses and his son for supper drest
400,16,630,"A year - old swine, and ere their host and guest"
400,16,631,"Had got their presence, Pallas had put by"
400,16,632,"With her fair rod Ulysses’ royalty,"
400,16,633,"And render’d him an aged man again,"
400,16,634,"With all his vile integuments, lest his swain"
400,16,635,"Should know him in his trim, and tell his queen,"
400,16,636,In these deep secrets being not deeply seen.
400,16,637,"He seen, to him the prince these words did use:"
400,16,638,“Welcome divine Eumæus! Now what news
400,16,639,Employs the city? Are the Wooers come
400,16,640,Back from their scout dismay’d? Or here at home
400,16,641,Will they again attempt me?” He replied:
400,16,642,“These touch not my care. I was satisfied
400,16,643,"To do, with most speed, what I went to do;"
400,16,644,"My message done, return. And yet, not so"
400,16,645,Came my news first; a herald (met with there)
400,16,646,"Forestall’d my tale, and told how safe you were."
400,16,647,"Besides which merely necessary thing,"
400,16,648,"What in my way chanc’d I may over - bring,"
400,16,649,"Being what I know, and witness’d with mine eyes."
400,16,650,Where the Hermæan sepulchre doth rise
400,16,651,"Above the city, I beheld take port"
400,16,652,"A ship, and in her many a man of sort;"
400,16,653,"Her freight was shields and lances; and, methought,"
400,16,654,"They were the Wooers; but, of knowledge, nought"
400,16,655,"Can therein tell you.” The prince smil’d, and knew"
400,16,656,"They were the Wooers, casting secret view"
400,16,657,Upon his father. But what they intended
400,16,658,"Fled far the herdsman; whose swain’s labours ended,"
400,16,659,"They dress’d the supper, which, past want, was eat."
400,16,660,"When all desire suffic’d of wine and meat,"
400,16,661,Of other human wants they took supplies
400,16,662,"At Sleep’s soft hand, who sweetly clos’d their eyes."

400,17,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,17,2,"Telemachus, return’d to town,"
400,17,3,"Makes to his curious mother known,"
400,17,4,"In part, his travels. After whom"
400,17,5,"Ulysses to the court doth come,"
400,17,6,"In good Eumæus’ guide, and prest"
400,17,7,To witness of the Wooers’ feast;
400,17,8,"Whom, though twice ten years did bestow"
400,17,9,"In far - off parts, his dog doth know."
400,17,10,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,17,11,_Ρω̑._
400,17,12,Ulysses shows
400,17,13,Through all disguise.
400,17,14,Whom his dog knows;
400,17,15,Who knowing dies.
400,17,16,"But when air’s rosy birth, the morn, arose,"
400,17,17,Telemachus did for the town dispose
400,17,18,His early steps; and took to his command
400,17,19,"His fair long lance, well - sorting with his hand,"
400,17,20,"Thus parting with Eumæus: “Now, my friend,"
400,17,21,"I must to town, lest too far I extend"
400,17,22,"My mother’s moan for me, who, till her eyes"
400,17,23,"Mine own eyes witness, varies tears and cries"
400,17,24,"Through all extremes. Do then this charge of mine,"
400,17,25,"And guide to town this hapless guest of thine,"
400,17,26,To beg elsewhere his further festival.
400,17,27,"Give they that please, I cannot give to all,"
400,17,28,Mine own wants take up for myself my pain.
400,17,29,"If it incense him, he the worst shall gain."
400,17,30,"The lovely truth I love, and must be plain.”"
400,17,31,"“Alas, friend,” said his father, “nor do I"
400,17,32,Desire at all your further charity.
400,17,33,"‘Tis better beg in cities than in fields,"
400,17,34,And take the worst a beggar’s fortune yields.
400,17,35,"Nor am I apt to stay in swine - styes more,"
400,17,36,However; ever the great chief before
400,17,37,The poor ranks must to ev’ry step obey.
400,17,38,"But go; your man in my command shall sway,"
400,17,39,"Anon yet too, by favour, when your fires"
400,17,40,"Have comforted the cold heat age expires,"
400,17,41,And when the sun’s flame hath besides corrected
400,17,42,"The early air abroad, not being protected"
400,17,43,"By these my bare weeds from the morning’s frost,"
400,17,44,Which (if so much ground is to be engrost
400,17,45,By my poor feet as you report) may give
400,17,46,Too violent charge to th’ heat by which I live.”
400,17,47,"This said, his son went on with spritely pace,"
400,17,48,And to the Wooers studied little grace.
400,17,49,"Arriv’d at home, he gave his jav’lin stay"
400,17,50,"Against a lofty pillar, and bold way"
400,17,51,Made further in. When having so far gone
400,17,52,"That he transcended the fair porch of stone,"
400,17,53,The first by far that gave his entry eye
400,17,54,Was nurse Euryclea; who th’ embrodery
400,17,55,Of stools there set was giving cushions fair;
400,17,56,"Who ran upon him, and her rapt repair"
400,17,57,Shed tears for joy. About him gather’d round
400,17,58,The other maids; his head and shoulders crown’d
400,17,59,With kisses and embraces. From above
400,17,60,"The Queen herself came, like the Queen of Love,"
400,17,61,Or bright Diana; cast about her son
400,17,62,"Her kind embraces, with effusión"
400,17,63,"Of loving tears; kiss’d both his lovely eyes,"
400,17,64,"His cheeks, and forehead; and gave all supplies"
400,17,65,"With this entreaty; “Welcome, sweetest light!"
400,17,66,I never had conceit to set quick sight
400,17,67,"On thee thus soon, when thy lov’d father’s fame"
400,17,68,"As far as Pylos did thy spirit inflame,"
400,17,69,In that search ventur’d all - unknown to me.
400,17,70,"O say, by what pow’r cam’st thou now to be"
400,17,71,Mine eyes’ dear object?” He return’d reply:
400,17,72,"“Move me not now, when you my ’scape descry"
400,17,73,"From imminent death, to think me fresh entrapt;"
400,17,74,"The fear’d wound rubbing, felt before I ’scapt."
400,17,75,Double not needless passion on a heart
400,17,76,"Whose joy so green is, and so apt t’ invert;"
400,17,77,"But pure weeds putting on, ascend and take"
400,17,78,"Your women with you, that ye all may make"
400,17,79,Vows of full hecatombs in sacred fire
400,17,80,"To all the Godheads, if their only Sire"
400,17,81,"Vouchsafe revenge of guest - rites wrong’d, which he"
400,17,82,Is to protect as being their Deity.
400,17,83,My way shall be directed to the hall
400,17,84,"Of common concourse, that I thence may call"
400,17,85,"A stranger, who from off the Pylian shore"
400,17,86,Came friendly with me; whom I sent before
400,17,87,"With all my soldiers, but in chief did charge"
400,17,88,"Piræus with him, wishing him t’ enlarge"
400,17,89,"His love to him at home, in best affair,"
400,17,90,"And utmost honours, till mine own repair.”"
400,17,91,"Her son thus spoken, his words could not bear"
400,17,92,"The wings too easily through her either ear,"
400,17,93,"But putting pure weeds on, made vows entire"
400,17,94,Of perfect hecatombs in sacred fire
400,17,95,"To all the Deities, if their only Sire"
400,17,96,"Vouchsaf’d revenge of guest - rites wrong’d, which he"
400,17,97,Was to protect as being their Deity.
400,17,98,"Her son left house, in his fair hand his lance,"
400,17,99,"His dogs attending; and, on ev’ry glance"
400,17,100,"His looks cast from them, Pallas put a grace"
400,17,101,That made him seem of the celestial race.
400,17,102,"Whom, come to concourse, ev’ry man admir’d,"
400,17,103,"About him throng’d the Wooers, and desir’d"
400,17,104,"All good to him in tongues, but in their hearts"
400,17,105,Most deep ills threaten’d to his most deserts.
400,17,106,"Of whose huge rout once free, he cast glad eye"
400,17,107,"On some that, long before his infancy,"
400,17,108,"Were with his father great and gracious,"
400,17,109,"Grave Halitherses, Mentor, Antiphus:"
400,17,110,"To whom he went, took seat by them, and they"
400,17,111,Inquir’d of all things since his parting day.
400,17,112,"To them Piræus came, and brought his guest"
400,17,113,"Along the city thither, whom not least"
400,17,114,"The prince respected, nor was long before"
400,17,115,He rose and met him. The first word yet bore
400,17,116,Piræus from them both; whose haste besought
400,17,117,The prince to send his women to see brought
400,17,118,"The gifts from his house that Atrides gave,"
400,17,119,"Which his own roofs, he thought, would better save."
400,17,120,The wise prince answer’d: “I can scarce conceive
400,17,121,The way to these works. If the Wooers reave
400,17,122,"By privy stratagem my life at home,"
400,17,123,I rather wish Piræus may become
400,17,124,"The master of them, than the best of these."
400,17,125,"But, if I sow in their fields of excess"
400,17,126,"Slaughter and ruin, then thy trust employ,"
400,17,127,And to me joying bring thou those with joy.”
400,17,128,"This said, he brought home his grief - practis’d guest;"
400,17,129,"Where both put off, both oil’d, and did invest"
400,17,130,"Themselves in rich robes, wash’d, and sate, and eat."
400,17,131,"His mother, in a fair chair taking seat"
400,17,132,"Directly opposite, her loom applied;"
400,17,133,"Who, when her son and guest had satisfied"
400,17,134,"Their appetites with feast, said: “O my son,"
400,17,135,You know that ever since your sire was won
400,17,136,"To go in Agamemnon’s guide to Troy,"
400,17,137,"Attempting sleep, I never did enjoy"
400,17,138,"One night’s good rest, but made my quiet bed"
400,17,139,"A sea blown - up with sighs, with tears still shed"
400,17,140,"Embrew’d and troubled; yet, though all your miss"
400,17,141,"In your late voyage hath been made for this,"
400,17,142,That you might know th’ abode your father made.
400,17,143,You shun to tell me what success you had.
400,17,144,"Now then, before the insolent access"
400,17,145,"The Wooers straight will force on us, express"
400,17,146,"What you have heard.” “I will,” said he, “and true."
400,17,147,"We came to Pylos, where the studious due"
400,17,148,"That any father could afford his son,"
400,17,149,(But new - arriv’d from some course he had run
400,17,150,"To an extreme length, in some voyage vow’d),"
400,17,151,"Nestor, the pastor of the people, show’d"
400,17,152,"To me arriv’d, in turrets thrust - up high,"
400,17,153,Where not his brave sons were more lov’d than I.
400,17,154,Yet of th’ unconquer’d ever - sufferer;
400,17,155,"Ulysses, never he could set his ear,"
400,17,156,"Alive or dead, from any earthy man."
400,17,157,"But to the great Lacedæmonian,"
400,17,158,"Atrides, famous for his lance, he sent,"
400,17,159,"With horse and chariots, me, to learn th’ event"
400,17,160,From his relation; where I had the view
400,17,161,"Of Argive Helen, whose strong beauties drew,"
400,17,162,"By wills of Gods, so many Grecian states,"
400,17,163,"And Trojans, under such laborious fates."
400,17,164,"Where Menelaus ask’d me, what affair"
400,17,165,To Lacedæmon render’d my repair.
400,17,166,"I told him all the truth, who made reply:"
400,17,167,‘O deed of most abhorr’d indecency!
400,17,168,A sort of impotents attempt his bed
400,17,169,Whose strength of mind hath cities levelléd!
400,17,170,"As to a lion’s den, when any hind"
400,17,171,"Hath brought her young calves, to their rest inclin’d,"
400,17,172,"When he is ranging hills, and herby dales,"
400,17,173,"To make of feeders there his festivals,"
400,17,174,"But, turning to his luster, calves and dam"
400,17,175,"He shows abhorr’d death, in his anger’s flame;"
400,17,176,"So, should Ulysses find this rabble hous’d"
400,17,177,"In his free turrets, courting his espous’d,"
400,17,178,"Foul death would fall them. O, I would to Jove,"
400,17,179,"Phœbus, and Pallas, that, when he shall prove"
400,17,180,The broad report of his exhausted store
400,17,181,"True with his eyes, his nerves and sinews wore"
400,17,182,"That vigour then that in the Lesbian tow’rs,"
400,17,183,Provok’d to wrastle with the iron pow’rs
400,17,184,"Philomelides vaunted, he approv’d;"
400,17,185,"When down he hurl’d his challenger, and mov’d"
400,17,186,Huge shouts from all the Achives then in view.
400,17,187,"If, once come home, he all those forces drew"
400,17,188,"About him there to work, they all were dead,"
400,17,189,And should find bitter his attempted bed.
400,17,190,"But what you ask and sue for, I, as far"
400,17,191,"As I have heard the true - spoke mariner,"
400,17,192,"Will tell directly, nor delude your ear:"
400,17,193,"He told me that an island did ensphere,"
400,17,194,"In much discomfort, great Laertes’ son;"
400,17,195,"And that the Nymph Calypso, overrun"
400,17,196,"With his affection, kept him in her caves,"
400,17,197,"Where men, nor ship, of pow’r to brook the waves,"
400,17,198,"Were near his convoy to his country’s shore,"
400,17,199,And where herself importun’d evermore
400,17,200,"His quiet stay; which not obtain’d, by force"
400,17,201,She kept his person from all else recourse.’
400,17,202,"This told Atrides, which was all he knew."
400,17,203,"Nor stay’d I more, but from the Gods there blew"
400,17,204,"A prosp’rous wind, that set me quickly here.”"
400,17,205,This put his mother quite from all her cheer.
400,17,206,When Theoclymenus the augur said:
400,17,207,"“O woman, honour’d with Ulysses’ bed,"
400,17,208,"Your son, no doubt, knows clearly nothing more,"
400,17,209,"Hear me yet speak, that can the truth uncore,"
400,17,210,"Nor will be curious. Jove then witness bear,"
400,17,211,"And this thy hospitable table here,"
400,17,212,"With this whole household of your blameless lord,"
400,17,213,That at this hour his royal feet are shor’d
400,17,214,"On his lov’d country - earth, and that ev’n here"
400,17,215,"Coming, or creeping, he will see the cheer"
400,17,216,"These Wooers make, and in his soul’s field sow"
400,17,217,Seeds that shall thrive to all their overthrow.
400,17,218,"This, set a ship - board, I knew sorted thus,"
400,17,219,And cried it out to your Telemachus.”
400,17,220,"Penelopé replied: “Would this would prove,"
400,17,221,"You well should witness a most friendly love,"
400,17,222,"And gifts such of me, as encount’ring Fame"
400,17,223,Should greet you with a blesséd mortal’s name.”
400,17,224,"This mutual speech past, all the Wooers were"
400,17,225,"Hurling the stone, and tossing of the spear,"
400,17,226,"Before the palace, in the pavéd court,"
400,17,227,Where otherwhiles their petulant resort
400,17,228,Sat plotting injuries. But when the hour
400,17,229,"Of supper enter’d, and the feeding pow’r"
400,17,230,"Brought sheep from field, that fill’d up ev’ry way"
400,17,231,"With those that us’d to furnish that purvey,"
400,17,232,"Medon, the herald (who of all the rest"
400,17,233,"Pleas’d most the Wooers, and at ev’ry feast"
400,17,234,Was ever near) said: “You whose kind consort
400,17,235,"Make the fair branches of the tree our court,"
400,17,236,"Grace it within now, and your suppers take."
400,17,237,"You that for health, and fair contention’s sake,"
400,17,238,"Will please your minds, know, bodies must have meat;"
400,17,239,_Play’s worse than idleness in times to eat.”_
400,17,240,"This said, all left, came in, cast by, on thrones"
400,17,241,"And chairs, their garments. Their provisións"
400,17,242,"Were sheep, swine, goats, the chiefly - great and fat,"
400,17,243,Besides an ox that from the herd they gat.
400,17,244,"And now the king and herdsman, from the field,"
400,17,245,In good way were to town; ’twixt whom was held
400,17,246,"Some walking conference, which thus begun"
400,17,247,"The good Eumæus: “Guest, your will was won,"
400,17,248,"Because the prince commanded, to make way"
400,17,249,"Up to the city, though I wish’d your stay,"
400,17,250,And to have made you guardian of my stall;
400,17,251,"But I, in care and fear of what might fall"
400,17,252,"In after - anger of the prince, forbore."
400,17,253,_The checks of princes touch their subjects sore._
400,17,254,"But make we haste, the day is nearly ended,"
400,17,255,And cold airs still are in the even extended.”
400,17,256,"“I know’t,” said he, “consider all; your charge"
400,17,257,Is giv’n to one that understands at large.
400,17,258,"Haste then. Hereafter, you shall lead the way;"
400,17,259,"Afford your staff too, if it fit your stay,"
400,17,260,That I may use it; since you say our pass
400,17,261,Is less friend to a weak foot than it was.”
400,17,262,"Thus cast he on his neck his nasty scrip,"
400,17,263,"All - patch’d and torn; a cord, that would not slip"
400,17,264,"For knots and bracks about the mouth of it,"
400,17,265,Made serve the turn; and then his swain did fit
400,17,266,His forc’d state with a staff. Then plied they hard
400,17,267,"Their way to town, their cottage left in guard"
400,17,268,To swains and dogs. And now Eumæus led
400,17,269,"The king along, his garments to a thread"
400,17,270,"All - bare and burn’d, and he himself hard bore"
400,17,271,"Upon his staff, at all parts like a poor"
400,17,272,And sad old beggar. But when now they got
400,17,273,"The rough highway, their voyage wanted not"
400,17,274,"Much of the city, where a fount they reach’d,"
400,17,275,"From whence the town their choicest water fetch’d,"
400,17,276,"That ever overflow’d, and curious art"
400,17,277,Was shown about it; in which three had part
400,17,278,"Whose names Neritus and Polyctor were,"
400,17,279,And famous Ithacus. It had a sphere
400,17,280,"Of poplar, that ran round about the wall;"
400,17,281,And into it a lofty rock let fall
400,17,282,Continual supply of cool clear stream.
400,17,283,"On whose top, to the Nymphs that were supreme"
400,17,284,"In those parts’ loves, a stately altar rose,"
400,17,285,Where ev’ry traveller did still impose
400,17,286,Devoted sacrifice. At this fount found
400,17,287,These silly travellers a man renown’d
400,17,288,"For guard of goats, which now he had in guide,"
400,17,289,"Whose huge - stor’d herd two herdsmen kept beside,"
400,17,290,"For all herds it excell’d, and bred a feed"
400,17,291,"For Wooers only. He was Dolius’ seed,"
400,17,292,And call’d Melanthius. Who casting eye
400,17,293,"On these two there, he chid them terribly,"
400,17,294,"And so past mean, that ev’n the wretched fate"
400,17,295,Now on Ulysses he did irritate.
400,17,296,His fume to this effect he did pursue:
400,17,297,"“Why so,’tis now at all parts passing true,"
400,17,298,"That ill leads ill, good evermore doth train"
400,17,299,"With like his like. Why, thou unenvied swain,"
400,17,300,"Whither dost thou lead this same victless leaguer,"
400,17,301,"This bane of banquets, this most nasty beggar,"
400,17,302,"Whose sight doth make one sad, it so abhors?"
400,17,303,"Who, with his standing in so many doors,"
400,17,304,Hath broke his back; and all his beggary tends
400,17,305,"To beg base crusts, but to no manly ends,"
400,17,306,"As asking swords, or with activity"
400,17,307,"To get a caldron. Wouldst thou give him me,"
400,17,308,"To farm my stable, or to sweep my yard,"
400,17,309,"And bring browse to my kids, and that preferr’d"
400,17,310,He should be at my keeping for his pains
400,17,311,To drink as much whey as his thirsty veins
400,17,312,Would still be swilling (whey made all his fees)
400,17,313,His monstrous belly would oppress his knees.
400,17,314,"But he hath learn’d to lead base life about,"
400,17,315,"And will not work, but crouch among the rout"
400,17,316,For broken meat to cram his bursten gut.
400,17,317,"Yet this I’ll say, and he will find it put"
400,17,318,"In sure effect, that if he enters where"
400,17,319,"Ulysses’ roofs cast shade, the stools will there"
400,17,320,"About his ears fly, all the house will throw,"
400,17,321,And rub his ragged sides with cuffs enow.”
400,17,322,"Past these reviles, his manless rudeness spurn’d"
400,17,323,Divine Ulysses; who at no part turn’d
400,17,324,"His face from him, but had his spirit fed"
400,17,325,"With these two thoughts, if he should strike him dead"
400,17,326,"With his bestowéd staff, or at his feet"
400,17,327,Make his direct head and the pavement meet.
400,17,328,"But he bore all, and entertain’d a breast"
400,17,329,That in the strife of all extremes did rest.
400,17,330,"Eumæus, frowning on him, chid him yet,"
400,17,331,"And, lifting up his hands to heav’n, he set"
400,17,332,This bitter curse at him: “O you that bear
400,17,333,"Fair name to be the race of Jupiter,"
400,17,334,Nymphs of these fountains! If Ulysses ever
400,17,335,"Burn’d thighs to you, that, hid in fat, did never"
400,17,336,"Fail your acceptance, of or lamb or kid,"
400,17,337,Grant this grace to me: Let the man thus hid
400,17,338,"Shine through his dark fate, make some God his guide,"
400,17,339,"That, to thee, goatherd, this same palate’s pride,[1]"
400,17,340,"Thou driv’st afore thee, he may come and make"
400,17,341,"The scatt’rings of the earth, and overtake"
400,17,342,"Thy wrongs, with forcing thee to ever err"
400,17,343,"About the city, hunted by his fear."
400,17,344,And in the mean space by some slothful swains
400,17,345,Let lousy sickness gnaw thy cattle’s veins.”
400,17,346,"“O Gods!” replied Melanthius, “what a curse"
400,17,347,"Hath this dog bark’d out, and can yet do worse!"
400,17,348,"This man shall I have giv’n into my hands,"
400,17,349,When in a well - built ship to far - off lands
400,17,350,"I shall transport him, that, should I want here,"
400,17,351,My sale of him may find me victuals there.
400,17,352,"And, for Ulysses, would to heav’n his joy"
400,17,353,"The silver - bearing - bow God would destroy,"
400,17,354,"This day, within his house, as sure as he"
400,17,355,The day of his return shall never see.”
400,17,356,"This said, he left them going silent on;"
400,17,357,"But he out - went them, and took straight upon"
400,17,358,"The palace - royal, which he enter’d straight,"
400,17,359,"Sat with the Wooers, and his trencher’s freight"
400,17,360,"The carvers gave him of the flesh there vented,"
400,17,361,But bread the rev’rend butleress presented.
400,17,362,"He took against Eurymachus his place,"
400,17,363,Who most of all the Wooers gave him grace.
400,17,364,"And now Ulysses and his swain got near,"
400,17,365,When round about them visited their ear
400,17,366,"The hollow harp’s delicious - stricken string,"
400,17,367,"To which did Phemius, near the Wooers, sing."
400,17,368,"Then by the hand Ulysses took his swain,"
400,17,369,"And said: “Eumæus, one may here see plain,"
400,17,370,"In many a grace, that Laertiades"
400,17,371,"Built here these turrets, and,’mongst others these,"
400,17,372,"His whole court arm’d with such a goodly wall,"
400,17,373,"The cornice, and the cope, majestical,"
400,17,374,"His double gates, and turrets, built too strong"
400,17,375,For force or virtue ever to expugn.
400,17,376,"I know the feasters in it now abound,"
400,17,377,Their cates cast such a savour; and the sound
400,17,378,The harp gives argues an accomplish’d feast.
400,17,379,_The Gods made music banquet’s dearest guest.”_
400,17,380,"“These things,” said he, “your skill may tell with ease,"
400,17,381,Since you are grac’d with greater knowledges.
400,17,382,"But now consult we how these works shall sort,"
400,17,383,"If you will first approach this praiséd court,"
400,17,384,"And see these Wooers, I remaining here;"
400,17,385,"Or I shall enter, and yourself forbear?"
400,17,386,"But be not you too tedious in your stay,"
400,17,387,Lest thrust ye be and buffeted away.
400,17,388,_Brain hath no fence for blows;_ look to ’t I pray.”
400,17,389,"“You speak to one that comprehends,” said he,"
400,17,390,"“Go you before, and here adventure me."
400,17,391,I have of old been us’d to cuffs and blows;
400,17,392,"My mind is harden’d, having borne the throes"
400,17,393,"Of many a sour event in waves and wars,"
400,17,394,Where knocks and buffets are no foreigners.
400,17,395,And this same harmful belly by no mean
400,17,396,The greatest abstinent can ever wean.
400,17,397,_Men suffer much bane by the belly’s rage;_
400,17,398,For whose sake ships in all their equipage
400,17,399,"Are arm’d, and set out to th’ untamed seas,"
400,17,400,Their bulks full - fraught with ills to enemies.”
400,17,401,Such speech they chang’d; when in the yard there lay
400,17,402,"A dog, call’d Argus, which, before his way"
400,17,403,"Assum’d for Ilion, Ulysses bred,"
400,17,404,"Yet stood his pleasure then in little stead,"
400,17,405,"As being too young, but, growing to his grace,"
400,17,406,"Young men made choice of him for ev’ry chace,"
400,17,407,"Or of their wild goats, of their hares, or harts."
400,17,408,"But his king gone, and he, now past his parts,"
400,17,409,"Lay all abjectly on the stable’s store,"
400,17,410,"Before the oxstall, and mules’ stable door,"
400,17,411,"To keep the clothes cast from the peasants’ hands,"
400,17,412,"While they laid compass on Ulysses’ lands,"
400,17,413,"The dog, with ticks (unlook’d - to) overgrown."
400,17,414,But by this dog no sooner seen but known
400,17,415,"Was wise Ulysses, who new - enter’d there,"
400,17,416,"Up went his dog’s laid ears, and, coming near,"
400,17,417,"Up he himself rose, fawn’d, and wagg’d his stern,"
400,17,418,"Couch’d close his ears, and lay so; nor discern[2]"
400,17,419,Could evermore his dear - lov’d lord again.
400,17,420,"Ulysses saw it, nor had pow’r t’ abstain"
400,17,421,From shedding tears; which (far - off seeing his swain)
400,17,422,He dried from his sight clean; to whom he thus
400,17,423,"His grief dissembled: “’Tis miraculous,"
400,17,424,That such a dog as this should have his lair
400,17,425,"On such a dunghill, for his form is fair."
400,17,426,"And yet, I know not, if there were in him"
400,17,427,"Good pace, or parts, for all his goodly limb;"
400,17,428,"Or he liv’d empty of those inward things,"
400,17,429,"As are those trencher - beagles tending kings,"
400,17,430,"Whom for their pleasure’s, or their glory’s, sake,"
400,17,431,"Or fashion, they into their favour take.”"
400,17,432,"“This dog,” said he, “was servant to one dead"
400,17,433,"A huge time since. But if he bore his head,"
400,17,434,"For form and quality, of such a height,"
400,17,435,"As when Ulysses, bound for th’ Ilion fight,"
400,17,436,"Or quickly after, left him, your rapt eyes"
400,17,437,Would then admire to see him use his thighs
400,17,438,"In strength and swiftness. He would nothing fly,"
400,17,439,Nor anything let ’scape. If once his eye
400,17,440,"Seiz’d any wild beast, he knew straight his scent;"
400,17,441,"Go where he would, away with him he went."
400,17,442,Nor was there ever any savage stood
400,17,443,Amongst the thickets of the deepest wood
400,17,444,"Long time before him, but he pull’d him down;"
400,17,445,As well by that true hunting to be shown
400,17,446,"In such vast coverts, as for speed of pace"
400,17,447,In any open lawn. For in deep chace
400,17,448,He was a passing - wise and well - nos’d hound.
400,17,449,And yet is all this good in him uncrown’d
400,17,450,"With any grace here now, nor he more fed"
400,17,451,"Than any errant cur. His king is dead,"
400,17,452,Far from his country; and his servants are
400,17,453,So negligent they lend his hound no care.
400,17,454,"_Where masters rule not, but let men alone,"
400,17,455,You never there see honest service done.
400,17,456,"That man’s half - virtue Jove takes quite away,"
400,17,457,That once is sun - burnt with the servile day.”_
400,17,458,"This said, he enter’d the well - builded - tow’rs,"
400,17,459,"Up bearing right upon the glorious Wooers,"
400,17,460,And left poor Argus dead; his lord’s first sight
400,17,461,Since that time twenty years bereft his light.
400,17,462,Telemachus did far the first behold
400,17,463,"Eumæus enter, and made signs he should"
400,17,464,"Come up to him. He, noting, came, and took"
400,17,465,On earth his seat. And then the master - cook
400,17,466,"Serv’d in more banquet; of which, part he set"
400,17,467,"Before the Wooers, part the prince did get,"
400,17,468,"Who sate alone, his table plac’d aside;"
400,17,469,To which the herald did the bread divide.
400,17,470,"After Eumæus, enter’d straight the king,[3]"
400,17,471,"Like to a poor and heavy aged thing,"
400,17,472,"Bore hard upon his staff, and was so clad"
400,17,473,As would have made his mere beholder sad.
400,17,474,"Upon the ashen floor his limbs he spread,"
400,17,475,"And ’gainst a cypress - threshold stay’d his head,"
400,17,476,"The tree wrought smooth, and in a line direct"
400,17,477,Tried by the plumb and by the architect.
400,17,478,"The prince then bade the herdsman give him bread,"
400,17,479,"The finest there, and see that prostrated"
400,17,480,At - all - parts plight of his giv’n all the cheer
400,17,481,"His hands could turn to: “Take,” said he, “and bear"
400,17,482,"These cates to him, and bid him beg of all"
400,17,483,"These Wooers here, and to their festival"
400,17,484,Bear up with all the impudence he can;
400,17,485,_Bashful behaviour fits no needy man.”_
400,17,486,"He heard, and did his will. “Hold guest,” said he,"
400,17,487,"“Telemachus commends these cates to thee,"
400,17,488,"Bids thee bear up, and all these Wooers implore."
400,17,489,_Wit must make impudent whom Fate makes poor.”_
400,17,490,"“O Jove,” said he, “do my poor pray’rs the grace"
400,17,491,"To make him blessed’st of the mortal race,"
400,17,492,And ev’ry thought now in his gen’rous heart
400,17,493,To deeds that further my desires convert.”
400,17,494,"Thus took he in with both his hands his store,"
400,17,495,"And in the uncouth scrip, that lay before"
400,17,496,"His ill - shod feet, repos’d it; whence he fed"
400,17,497,All time the music to the feasters play’d.
400,17,498,"Both jointly ending, then began the Wooers"
400,17,499,To put in old act their tumultuous pow’rs;
400,17,500,"When Pallas standing close did prompt her friend,"
400,17,501,To prove how far the bounties would extend
400,17,502,"Of those proud Wooers; so, to let him try"
400,17,503,"Who most, who least, had learn’d humanity."
400,17,504,"However, no thought touch’d Minerva’s mind,"
400,17,505,That anyone should’scape his wreak design’d.
400,17,506,"He handsomely became all, crept about"
400,17,507,"To ev’ry Wooer, held a forc’d hand out,"
400,17,508,"And all his work did in so like a way,"
400,17,509,As he had practis’d begging many a day.
400,17,510,"And though they knew all beggars could do this,"
400,17,511,Yet they admir’d it as no deed of his;
400,17,512,"Though far from thought of other, us’d expence"
400,17,513,"And pity to him, who he was, and whence,"
400,17,514,Inquiring mutually. Melanthius then:
400,17,515,"“Hear me, ye Wooers of the far - fam’d queen,"
400,17,516,About this beggar. I have seen before
400,17,517,"This face of his; and know for certain more,"
400,17,518,"That this swain brought him hither. What he is,"
400,17,519,"Or whence he came, flies me.” Reply to this"
400,17,520,"Antinous made, and mock’d Eumæus thus:"
400,17,521,"“O thou renownéd herdsman, why to us"
400,17,522,Brought’st thou this beggar? Serves it not our hands;
400,17,523,"That other land - leapers, and cormorands,"
400,17,524,"Profane poor knaves, lie on us, unconducted,"
400,17,525,But you must bring them? So amiss instructed
400,17,526,"Art thou in course of thrift, as not to know"
400,17,527,Thy lord’s goods wrack’d in this their overflow?
400,17,528,"Which think’st thou nothing, that thou call’st in these?”"
400,17,529,"Eumæus answer’d: “Though you may be wise,"
400,17,530,You speak not wisely. Who calls in a guest
400,17,531,That is a guest himself? None call to feast
400,17,532,"Other than men that are of public use,"
400,17,533,"Prophets, or poets, whom the Gods produce,"
400,17,534,"Physicians for men’s ills, or architects."
400,17,535,Such men the boundless earth affords respects
400,17,536,"Bounded in honour, and may call them well."
400,17,537,But poor men who calls? Who doth so excell
400,17,538,In others’ good to do himself an ill?
400,17,539,But all Ulysses’ servants have been still
400,17,540,"Eyesores in your way more than all that woo,"
400,17,541,"And chiefly I. But what care I for you,"
400,17,542,As long as these roofs hold as thralls to none
400,17,543,The wise Penelope and her god - like son?”
400,17,544,"“Forbear,” said he, “and leave this tongue’s bold ill."
400,17,545,"Antinous uses to be crossing still,"
400,17,546,"And give sharp words; his blood that humour bears,"
400,17,547,To set men still together by the ears.
400,17,548,"But,” turning then t’ Antinous, “O,” said he,"
400,17,549,"“You entertain a father’s care of me,"
400,17,550,To turn these eating guests out. ’Tis advice
400,17,551,"Of needful use for my poor faculties,"
400,17,552,But God doth not allow this; there must be
400,17,553,Some care of poor men in humanity.
400,17,554,"What you yourselves take, give; I not envy,"
400,17,555,But give command that hospitality
400,17,556,"Be giv’n all strangers. Nor shall my pow’rs fear,"
400,17,557,If this mood in me reach my mother’s ear;
400,17,558,"Much less the servants’, that are here to see"
400,17,559,Ulysses’ house kept in his old degree.
400,17,560,"But you bear no such mind, your wits more cast"
400,17,561,To fill yourself than let another taste.”
400,17,562,Antinous answer’d him: “Brave - spoken man!
400,17,563,Whose mind’s free fire see check’d no virtue can.
400,17,564,If all we Wooers here would give as much
400,17,565,"As my mind serves, his[4] largess should be such"
400,17,566,As would for three months serve his far - off way
400,17,567,From troubling your house with more cause of stay.”
400,17,568,"This said, he took a stool up, that did rest,"
400,17,569,"Beneath the board, his spangled feet at feast,"
400,17,570,"And offer’d at him; but the rest gave all,"
400,17,571,And fill’d his fulsome scrip with festival.
400,17,572,"And so Ulysses for the present was,"
400,17,573,"And for the future, furnish’d, and his pass"
400,17,574,Bent to the door to eat. Yet could not leave
400,17,575,"Antinous so, but said: “Do you too give,"
400,17,576,Lov’d lord; your presence makes a show to me
400,17,577,"As you not worst were of the company,"
400,17,578,"But best, and so much that you seem the king,"
400,17,579,And therefore you should give some better thing
400,17,580,"Than bread, like others. I will spread your praise"
400,17,581,"Through all the wide world, that have in my days"
400,17,582,"Kept house myself, and trod the wealthy ways"
400,17,583,Of other men ev’n to the title Blest;
400,17,584,And often have I giv’n an erring guest
400,17,585,(How mean soever) to the utmost gain
400,17,586,"Of what he wanted, kept whole troops of men,"
400,17,587,"And had all other comings in, with which"
400,17,588,"Men live so well, and gain the fame of rich."
400,17,589,Yet Jove consum’d all; he would have it so;
400,17,590,"To which, his mean was this: He made me go"
400,17,591,"Far off, for Egypt, in the rude consort"
400,17,592,"Of all - ways - wand’ring pirates, where, in port,"
400,17,593,"I bade my lov’d men draw their ships ashore,"
400,17,594,And dwell amongst them; sent out some t’ explore
400,17,595,"Up to the mountains, who, intemperate,"
400,17,596,"And their inflam’d bloods bent to satiate,"
400,17,597,"Forag’d the rich fields, hal’d the women thence,"
400,17,598,"And unwean’d children, with the foul expence"
400,17,599,Both of their fames and bloods. The cry then flew
400,17,600,Straight to the city; and the great fields grew
400,17,601,"With horse and foot, and flam’d with iron arms;"
400,17,602,When Jove (that breaks the thunder in alarms)
400,17,603,An ill flight cast amongst my men; not one
400,17,604,"Inspir’d with spirit to stand, and turn upon"
400,17,605,The fierce pursuing foe; and therefore stood
400,17,606,"Their ill fate thick about them; some in blood,"
400,17,607,And some in bondage; toils led by constraint
400,17,608,Fast’ning upon them. Me along they sent
400,17,609,"To Cyprus with a stranger - prince they met,"
400,17,610,"Dmetor Iasides, who th’ imperial seat"
400,17,611,Of that sweet island sway’d in strong command.
400,17,612,And thus feel I here need’s contemned hand.”
400,17,613,"“And what God sent,” said he, “this suff’ring bane"
400,17,614,"To vex our banquet? Stand off, nor profane"
400,17,615,"My board so boldly, lest I show thee here"
400,17,616,Cyprus and Egypt made more sour than there.
400,17,617,You are a saucy set - fac’d vagabond.
400,17,618,"About with all you go, and they, beyond"
400,17,619,"Discretion, give thee, since they find not here"
400,17,620,The least proportion set down to their cheer.
400,17,621,But ev’ry fountain hath his under - floods.
400,17,622,_It is no bounty to give others’ goods.”_
400,17,623,"“O Gods,” replied Ulysses, “I see now,"
400,17,624,You bear no soul in this your goodly show.
400,17,625,"Beggars at your board, I perceive, should get"
400,17,626,"Scarce salt from your hands, if themselves brought meat;"
400,17,627,"Since, sitting where another’s board is spread,"
400,17,628,"That flows with feast, not to the broken bread"
400,17,629,"Will your allowance reach.” “Nay then,” said he,"
400,17,630,"And look’d austerely, “if so saucy be"
400,17,631,"Your suffer’d language, I suppose, that clear"
400,17,632,You shall not ’scape without some broken cheer.”
400,17,633,"Thus rapt he up a stool, with which he smit"
400,17,634,"The king’s right shoulder, ’twixt his neck and it."
400,17,635,He stood him like a rock. Antinous’ dart
400,17,636,Nor stirr’d Ulysses; who in his great heart
400,17,637,"Deep ills projected, which, for time yet, close"
400,17,638,"He bound in silence, shook his head, and went"
400,17,639,"Out to the entry, where he then gave vent"
400,17,640,"To his full scrip, sat on the earth, and eat,"
400,17,641,"And talk’d still to the Wooers: “Hear me yet,"
400,17,642,Ye Wooers of the Queen. It never grieves
400,17,643,"A man to take blows, where for sheep, or beeves,"
400,17,644,"Or other main possessions, a man fights;"
400,17,645,"But for his harmful belly this man smites,"
400,17,646,Whose love to many a man breeds many a woe.
400,17,647,"And if the poor have Gods, and Furies too,"
400,17,648,"Before Antinous wear his nuptial wreath,"
400,17,649,He shall be worn upon the dart of death.”
400,17,650,"“Harsh guest,” said he, “sit silent at your meat,"
400,17,651,"Or seek your desp’rate plight some safer seat,"
400,17,652,"Lest by the hands or heels youths drag your years,"
400,17,653,And rend your rotten rags about your ears.”
400,17,654,"This made the rest as highly hate his folly,"
400,17,655,As he had violated something holy.
400,17,656,"When one, ev’n of the proudest, thus began:"
400,17,657,"“Thou dost not nobly, thus to play the man"
400,17,658,On such an errant wretch. O ill dispos’d!
400,17,659,Perhaps some sacred Godhead goes enclos’d
400,17,660,Ev’n in his abject outside; for the Gods
400,17,661,Have often visited these rich abodes
400,17,662,"Like such poor stranger pilgrims, since their pow’rs"
400,17,663,"(Being always shapeful) glide through towns and tow’rs,"
400,17,664,"Observing, as they pass still, who they be"
400,17,665,"That piety love, and who impiety.”"
400,17,666,"This all men said, but he held sayings cheap."
400,17,667,And all this time Telemachus did heap
400,17,668,"Sorrow on sorrow on his beating heart,"
400,17,669,To see his father stricken; yet let part
400,17,670,"No tear to earth, but shook his head, and thought"
400,17,671,As deep as those ills that were after wrought.
400,17,672,"The Queen now, hearing of her poor guest’s stroke,"
400,17,673,"Said to her maid (as to her Wooer she spoke),"
400,17,674,"“I wish the famous - for - his - bow, the Sun,"
400,17,675,"Would strike thy heart so.” Her wish, thus begun,"
400,17,676,"Her lady, fair Eurynome, pursued"
400,17,677,"Her execration, and did thus conclude:"
400,17,678,"“So may our vows call down from heav’n his end,"
400,17,679,And let no one life of the rest extend
400,17,680,"His life till morning.” “O Eurynomé,”"
400,17,681,"Replied the Queen, “may all Gods speak in thee,"
400,17,682,"For all the Wooers we should rate as foes,"
400,17,683,Since all their weals they place in others’ woes!
400,17,684,"But this Antinous we past all should hate,"
400,17,685,As one resembling black and cruel Fate.
400,17,686,"A poor strange wretch begg’d here, compell’d by need,"
400,17,687,"Ask’d all, and ev’ry one gave in his deed,"
400,17,688,"Fill’d his sad scrip, and eas’d his heavy wants,"
400,17,689,"Only this man bestow’d unmanly taunts,"
400,17,690,"And with a cruel blow, his force let fly,"
400,17,691,‘Twixt neck and shoulders show’d his charity.”
400,17,692,"These minds, above, she and her maids did show,"
400,17,693,"While, at his scrip, Ulysses sat below."
400,17,694,"In which time she Eumæus call’d, and said:"
400,17,695,"“Go, good Eumæus, and see soon convey’d"
400,17,696,The stranger to me; bid him come and take
400,17,697,"My salutations for his welcome’s sake,"
400,17,698,"And my desire serve, if he hath not heard"
400,17,699,"Or seen distress’d Ulysses, who hath err’d"
400,17,700,"Like such a man, and therefore chance may fall"
400,17,701,He hath by him been met and spoke withal?”
400,17,702,"“O Queen,” said he, “I wish to heav’n your ear"
400,17,703,Were quit of this unrev’rend noise you hear
400,17,704,"From these rude Wooers, when I bring the guest;"
400,17,705,Such words your ear would let into your breast
400,17,706,As would delight it to your very heart.
400,17,707,Three nights and days I did my roof impart
400,17,708,To his fruition (for he came to me
400,17,709,The first of all men since he fled the sea)
400,17,710,And yet he had not giv’n a perfect end
400,17,711,To his relation of what woes did spend
400,17,712,"The spite of Fate on him, but as you see[5]"
400,17,713,"A singer, breathing out of Deity"
400,17,714,"Love - kindling lines, when all men seated near"
400,17,715,Are rapt with endless thirst to ever hear;
400,17,716,"So sweeten’d he my bosom at my meat,"
400,17,717,"Affirming that Ulysses was in Crete,"
400,17,718,"Where first the memories of Minos were,"
400,17,719,"A guest to him there dwelling then, as dear"
400,17,720,As his true father; and from thence came he
400,17,721,"Tir’d on with sorrows, toss’d from sea to sea,"
400,17,722,"To cast himself in dust, and tumble here,"
400,17,723,"At Wooers’ feet, for blows and broken cheer."
400,17,724,"But of Ulysses, where the Thesprots dwell,"
400,17,725,"A wealthy people, Fame, he says, did tell"
400,17,726,The still survival; who his native light
400,17,727,"Was bound for now, with treasure infinite.”"
400,17,728,"“Call him,” said she, “that he himself may say"
400,17,729,This over to me. We shall soon have way
400,17,730,"Giv’n by the Wooers; they, as well at gate,"
400,17,731,"As set within doors, use to recreate"
400,17,732,Their high - fed spirits. As their humours lead
400,17,733,They follow; and may well; for still they tread
400,17,734,"Uncharg’d ways here, their own wealth lying unwasted"
400,17,735,"In poor - kept houses, only something tasted"
400,17,736,"Their bread and wine is by their household swains,"
400,17,737,But they themselves let loose continual reins
400,17,738,"To our expenses, making slaughter still"
400,17,739,"Of sheep, goats, oxen, feeding past their fill,"
400,17,740,And vainly lavishing our richest wine;
400,17,741,"All these extending past the sacred line,"
400,17,742,For here lives no man like Ulysses now
400,17,743,To curb these reins. But should he once show
400,17,744,"His country - light his presence, he and his"
400,17,745,Would soon revenge these Wooers’ injuries.”
400,17,746,"This said, about the house, in echoes round,"
400,17,747,Her son’s strange neesings made a horrid sound;[6]
400,17,748,"At which the Queen yet laugh’d, and said: “Go call"
400,17,749,"The stranger to me. Heard’st thou not, to all"
400,17,750,"My words last utter’d, what a neesing brake"
400,17,751,"From my Telemachus? From whence I make,"
400,17,752,This sure conclusion: That the death and fate
400,17,753,Of ev’ry Wooer here is near his date.
400,17,754,"Call, then, the guest, and if he tell as true"
400,17,755,"What I shall ask him, coat, cloak, all things new,"
400,17,756,"These hands shall yield him.” This said, down he went,"
400,17,757,"And told Ulysses, “that the Queen had sent"
400,17,758,"To call him to her, that she might enquire"
400,17,759,About her husband what her sad desire
400,17,760,"Urg’d her to ask; and, if she found him true,"
400,17,761,"Both coat, and cassock (which he needed) new"
400,17,762,"Her hands would put on him; and that the bread,"
400,17,763,"Which now he begg’d amongst the common tread,"
400,17,764,"Should freely feed his hunger now from her,"
400,17,765,Who all he wish’d would to his wants prefer.”
400,17,766,His answer was: “I will with fit speed tell
400,17,767,The whole truth to the Queen; for passing well
400,17,768,"I know her lord, since he and I have shar’d"
400,17,769,In equal sorrows. But I much am scar’d
400,17,770,"With this rude multitude of Wooers here,"
400,17,771,The rage of whose pride smites heav’n’s brazen sphere.
400,17,772,"Of whose rout when one struck me for no fault,"
400,17,773,Telemachus nor none else turn’d th’ assault
400,17,774,"From my poor shoulders. Therefore, though she haste,"
400,17,775,Beseech the Queen her patience will see past
400,17,776,"The day’s broad light, and then may she enquire."
400,17,777,’Tis but my closer pressing to the fire
400,17,778,"In th’ ev’ning’s cold, because my weeds, you know,"
400,17,779,Are passing thin; for I made bold to show
400,17,780,"Their bracks to you, and pray’d your kind supply.”"
400,17,781,"He heard, and hasted; and met instantly"
400,17,782,"The Queen upon the pavement in his way,"
400,17,783,Who ask’d: “What! Bring’st thou not? What cause of stay
400,17,784,Find his austere supposes? Takes he fear
400,17,785,Of th’ unjust Wooers? Or thus hard doth bear
400,17,786,On any other doubt the house objects?
400,17,787,"He does me wrong, and gives too nice respects"
400,17,788,"To his fear’d safety.” “He does right,” said he,"
400,17,789,“And what he fears should move the policy
400,17,790,Of any wise one; taking care to shun
400,17,791,"The violent Wooers. He bids bide, till sun"

400,17,793,"’Twill make your best course, since you two, unseen,"
400,17,794,"May pass th’ encounter; you to speak more free,"
400,17,795,And he your ear gain less distractedly.”
400,17,796,"“The guest is wise,” said she, “and well doth give"
400,17,797,"The right thought use. Of all the men that live,"
400,17,798,"Life serves none such as these proud Wooers are,"
400,17,799,To give a good man cause to use his care.”
400,17,800,"Thus, all agreed, amongst the Wooers goes"
400,17,801,"Eumæus to the prince, and, whisp’ring close,"
400,17,802,"Said: “Now, my love, my charge shall take up me,"
400,17,803,"(Your goods and mine). What here is, you must see"
400,17,804,"In fit protection. But, in chief, regard"
400,17,805,"Your own dear safeguard; whose state study hard,"
400,17,806,Lest suff’rance seize you. Many a wicked thought
400,17,807,Conceal these Wooers; whom just Jove see brought
400,17,808,"To utter ruin, ere it touch at us.”"
400,17,809,"“So chance it, friend,” replied Telemachus,"
400,17,810,"“Your bever taken, go. In first of day"
400,17,811,"Come, and bring sacrifice the best you may."
400,17,812,To me and to th’ Immortals be the care
400,17,813,or whatsoever here the safeties are.”
400,17,814,"This said, he sat in his elaborate throne."
400,17,815,Eumæus (fed to satisfaction)
400,17,816,"Went to his charge, left both the court and walls"
400,17,817,"Full of secure and fatal festivals,"
400,17,818,In which the Wooers’ pleasures still would sway.
400,17,819,And now begun the even’s near - ending day.

400,18,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,18,2,Ulysses and rogue Irus fight.
400,18,3,Penelope vouchsafes her sight
400,18,4,To all her Wooers; who present
400,18,5,"Gifts to her, ravish’d with content."
400,18,6,A certain parlé then we sing.
400,18,7,Betwixt a Wooer and the King.
400,18,8,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,18,9,_Σίγμα._
400,18,10,The beggar’s glee.
400,18,11,The King’s high fame.
400,18,12,Gifts giv’n to see
400,18,13,A virtuous dame.
400,18,14,"There came a common beggar to the court,"
400,18,15,"Who in the city begg’d of all resort,"
400,18,16,"Excell’d in madness of the gut, drunk, ate,"
400,18,17,"Past intermission, was most hugely great,"
400,18,18,"Yet had no fibres in him nor no force,"
400,18,19,"In sight a man, in mind a living corse."
400,18,20,"His true name was Arnæus, for his mother"
400,18,21,"Impos’d it from his birth, and yet another"
400,18,22,The city youth would give him (from the course
400,18,23,"He after took, deriv’d out of the force"
400,18,24,"That need held on him, which was up and down"
400,18,25,To run on all men’s errands through the town)
400,18,26,"Which sounded Irus. When whose gut was come,"
400,18,27,"He needs would bar Ulysses his own home,"
400,18,28,"And fell to chiding him: “Old man,” said he,"
400,18,29,“Your way out of the entry quickly see
400,18,30,"Be with fair language taken, lest your stay"
400,18,31,But little longer see you dragg’d away.
400,18,32,"See, sir, observe you not how all these make"
400,18,33,"Direct signs at me, charging me to take"
400,18,34,"Your heels, and drag you out? But I take shame."
400,18,35,"Rise yet, y’ are best, lest we two play a game"
400,18,36,"At cuffs together.” He bent brows, and said:"
400,18,37,"“Wretch! I do thee no ill, nor once upbraid"
400,18,38,"Thy presence with a word, nor, what mine eye"
400,18,39,"By all hands sees thee giv’n, one thought envy."
400,18,40,Nor shouldst thou envy others. Thou may’st see
400,18,41,The place will hold us both; and seem’st to me
400,18,42,A beggar like myself; which who can mend?
400,18,43,_The Gods give most to whom they least are friend.
400,18,44,"The chief goods Gods give, is in good to end._"
400,18,45,"But to the hands’ strife, of which y’ are so free,"
400,18,46,"Provoke me not, for fear you anger me;"
400,18,47,"And lest the old man, on whose scorn you stood,"
400,18,48,Your lips and bosom make shake hands in blood.
400,18,49,"I love my quiet well, and more will love"
400,18,50,To - morrow than to - day. But if you move
400,18,51,"My peace beyond my right, the war you make"
400,18,52,Will never after give you will to take
400,18,53,Ulysses’ house into your begging walk.”
400,18,54,"“O Gods,” said he, “how volubly doth talk"
400,18,55,"This eating gulf! And how his fume breaks out,"
400,18,56,As from an old crack’d oven! Whom I will clout
400,18,57,"So bitterly, and so with both hands mall"
400,18,58,"His chaps together, that his teeth shall fall"
400,18,59,"As plain seen on the earth as any sow’s,"
400,18,60,"That ruts the corn - fields, or devours the mows."
400,18,61,"Come, close we now, that all may see what wrong"
400,18,62,An old man tempts that takes at cuffs a young.”
400,18,63,Thus in the entry of those lofty tow’rs
400,18,64,"These two, with all spleen, spent their jarring pow’rs."
400,18,65,"Antinous took it, laugh’d, and said: “O friends,"
400,18,66,We never had such sport! This guest contends
400,18,67,With this vast beggar at the buffet’s fight.
400,18,68,"Come, join we hands, and screw up all their spite.”"
400,18,69,All rose in laughters; and about them bore
400,18,70,All the ragg’d rout of beggars at the door.
400,18,71,Then mov’d Antinous the victor’s hire
400,18,72,To all the Wooers thus: “There are now at fire
400,18,73,Two breasts of goat; both which let law set down
400,18,74,"Before the man that wins the day’s renown,"
400,18,75,With all their fat and gravy. And of both
400,18,76,"The glorious victor shall prefer his tooth,"
400,18,77,"To which he makes his choice of, from us all,"
400,18,78,"And ever after banquet in our hall,"
400,18,79,With what our boards yield; not a beggar more
400,18,80,"Allow’d to share, but all keep out at door.”"
400,18,81,"This he propos’d; and this they all approv’d,"
400,18,82,"To which Ulysses answer’d: “O most lov’d,"
400,18,83,"By no means should an old man, and one old"
400,18,84,"In chief with sorrows, be so over - bold"
400,18,85,"To combat with his younger; but, alas,"
400,18,86,Man’s own - ill - working belly needs will pass
400,18,87,"This work upon me, and enforce me, too,"
400,18,88,"To beat this fellow. But then, you must do"
400,18,89,"My age no wrong, to take my younger’s part,"
400,18,90,"And play me foul play, making your strokes’ smart"
400,18,91,Help his to conquer; for you eas’ly may
400,18,92,"With your strengths crush me. Do then right, and lay"
400,18,93,"Your honours on it in your oaths, to yield"
400,18,94,"His part no aid, but equal leave the field.”"
400,18,95,All swore his will. But then Telemachus
400,18,96,His father’s scoffs with comforts serious
400,18,97,"Could not but answer, and made this reply:"
400,18,98,"“Guest! If thine own pow’rs cheer thy victory,"
400,18,99,Fear no man’s else that will not pass it free.
400,18,100,He fights with many that shall touch but thee.
400,18,101,I’ll see thy guest - right paid. Thou here art come
400,18,102,In my protection; and to this the sum
400,18,103,Of all these Wooers (which Antinous are
400,18,104,And King Eurymachus) conjoin their care.”
400,18,105,"Both vow’d it. When Ulysses, laying by"
400,18,106,"His upper weed, his inner beggary"
400,18,107,"Near show’d his shame, which he with rags prevented"
400,18,108,"Pluck’d from about his thighs, and so presented"
400,18,109,"Their goodly sight, which were so white and great,"
400,18,110,And his large shoulders were to view so set
400,18,111,"By his bare rags, his arms, his breast, and all,"
400,18,112,"So broad, and brawny — their grace natural"
400,18,113,"Being kept by Pallas, ever standing near —"
400,18,114,That all the Wooers his admirers were
400,18,115,"Beyond all measure, mutual whispers driv’n"
400,18,116,"Through all their cluster, saying: “Sure as heav’n"
400,18,117,Poor Irus pull’d upon him bitter blows.
400,18,118,Through his thin garment what a thigh he shows!”
400,18,119,They said; but Irus felt. His coward mind
400,18,120,Was mov’d at root. But now he needs must find
400,18,121,Facts to his brags; and forth at all parts fit
400,18,122,"The servants brought him, all his art’ries smit"
400,18,123,"With fears and tremblings. Which Antinous saw,"
400,18,124,"And said: “Nay, now too late comes fear. No law"
400,18,125,"Thou shouldst at first have giv’n thy braggart vein,"
400,18,126,"Nor should it so have swell’d, if terrors strain"
400,18,127,"Thy spirits to this pass, for a man so old,"
400,18,128,And worn with penuries that still lay hold
400,18,129,"On his ragg’d person. Howsoever, take"
400,18,130,"This vow from me for firm: That if, he make"
400,18,131,"Thy forces stoop, and prove his own supreme,"
400,18,132,"I’ll put thee in a ship, and down the stream"
400,18,133,"Send thee ashore where King Echetus reigns,"
400,18,134,(The roughest tyrant that the world contains)
400,18,135,"And he will slit thy nostrils, crop each ear,"
400,18,136,"Thy shame cut off, and give it dogs to tear.”"
400,18,137,This shook his nerves the more. But both were now
400,18,138,Brought to the lists; and up did either throw
400,18,139,"His heavy fists. Ulysses, in suspense"
400,18,140,To strike so home that he should fright from thence
400,18,141,"His coward soul, his trunk laid prostrate there,"
400,18,142,"Or let him take more leisure to his fear,"
400,18,143,"And stoop him by degrees. The last show’d best,"
400,18,144,"To strike him slightly, out of fear the rest"
400,18,145,"Would else discover him. But, peace now broke,"
400,18,146,On his right shoulder Irus laid his stroke.
400,18,147,"Ulysses struck him just beneath the ear,"
400,18,148,"His jawbone broke, and made the blood appear;"
400,18,149,"When straight he strew’d the dust, and made his cry"
400,18,150,"Stand for himself; with whom his teeth did lie,"
400,18,151,Spit with his blood out; and against the ground
400,18,152,His heels lay sprawling. Up the hands went round
400,18,153,"Of all the Wooers, all at point to die"
400,18,154,With violent laughters. Then the king did ply
400,18,155,"The beggar’s feet, and dragg’d him forth the hall,"
400,18,156,"Along the entry, to the gates and wall;"
400,18,157,"Where leaving him, he put into his hand"
400,18,158,A staff; and bade him there use his command
400,18,159,"On swine and dogs, and not presume to be"
400,18,160,"Lord of the guests, or of the beggary,"
400,18,161,Since he of all men was the scum and curse;
400,18,162,"And so bade please with that, or fare yet worse."
400,18,163,"Then cast he on his scrip, all - patch’d and rent,"
400,18,164,"Hung by a rotten cord, and back he went"
400,18,165,To greet the entry’s threshold with his seat.
400,18,166,"The Wooers throng’d to him, and did entreat"
400,18,167,"With gentle words his conquest, laughing still,"
400,18,168,Pray’d Jove and all the Gods to give his will
400,18,169,"What most it wish’d him and would joy him most,"
400,18,170,Since he so happily had clear’d their coast
400,18,171,Of that unsavoury morsel; whom they vow’d
400,18,172,To see with all their utmost haste bestow’d
400,18,173,"Aboard a ship, and for Epirus sent"
400,18,174,"To King Echetus, on whose throne was spent"
400,18,175,The worst man’s seat that breath’d. And thus was grac’d
400,18,176,"Divine Ulysses, who with joy embrac’d"
400,18,177,Ev’n that poor conquest. Then was set to him
400,18,178,The goodly goat’s breast promis’d (that did swim
400,18,179,"In fat and gravy) by Antinous,"
400,18,180,"And from a basket, by Amphinomus,"
400,18,181,"Were two breads giv’n him; who, besides, renown’d"
400,18,182,"His banquet with a golden goblet; crown’d,"
400,18,183,"And this high salutation: “Frolic, guest,"
400,18,184,And be those riches that you first possest
400,18,185,"Restor’d again with full as many joys,"
400,18,186,As in your poor state I see now annoys.”
400,18,187,"“Amphinomus,” said he, “you seem to me"
400,18,188,"Exceeding wise, as being the progeny"
400,18,189,Of such a father as authentic Fame
400,18,190,"Hath told me was so, one of honour’d name,"
400,18,191,"And great revenues in Dulichius,"
400,18,192,His fair name Nisus. He is blazon’d thus;
400,18,193,"And you to be his son, his wisdom heiring,"
400,18,194,"As well as wealth, his state in nought impairing."
400,18,195,"To prove which always, let me tell you this,"
400,18,196,(As warning you to shun the miseries
400,18,197,"That follow full states, if they be not held"
400,18,198,"With wisdom still at full, and so compell’d"
400,18,199,"To courses that abode not in their brows,"
400,18,200,"By too much swing, their sudden overthrows)"
400,18,201,"_Of all things breathing, or that creep on earth,"
400,18,202,Nought is more wretched than a human birth.
400,18,203,"Bless’d men think never they can cursed be,"
400,18,204,While any power lasts to move a knee._
400,18,205,"But when the bless’d Gods make them feel that smart,"
400,18,206,"That fled their faith so, as they had no heart"
400,18,207,"They bear their suff’rings, and, what well they might"
400,18,208,"Have clearly shunn’d, they then meet in despite."
400,18,209,"_The mind of man flies still out of his way,"
400,18,210,Unless God guide and prompt it ev’ry day._
400,18,211,I thought me once a blesséd man with men.
400,18,212,"And fashion’d me to all so counted then,"
400,18,213,"Did all injustice like them, what for lust,"
400,18,214,"Or any pleasure, never so unjust"
400,18,215,"I could by pow’r or violence obtain,"
400,18,216,"And gave them both in all their pow’rs the rein,"
400,18,217,Bold of my fathers and my brothers still;
400,18,218,While which held good my arts seem’d never ill.
400,18,219,"And thus is none held simply good or bad,"
400,18,220,But as his will is either miss’d or had.
400,18,221,"All goods God’s gifts man calls, howe’er he gets them,"
400,18,222,"And so takes all; what price soe’er God sets them,"
400,18,223,"Says nought how ill they come, nor will controul"
400,18,224,"That ravine in him, though it cost his soul."
400,18,225,"And these parts here I see these Wooers play,"
400,18,226,"Take all that falls, and all dishonours lay"
400,18,227,"On that man’s Queen, that, tell your friends, doth bear"
400,18,228,"No long time’s absence, but is passing near."
400,18,229,"Let God then guide thee home, lest he may meet"
400,18,230,In his return thy undeparted feet;
400,18,231,"For when he enters, and sees men so rude,"
400,18,232,The quarrel cannot but in blood conclude.”
400,18,233,"This said, he sacrific’d, then drunk, and then"
400,18,234,Referr’d the giv’n bowl to the guide - of - men;
400,18,235,"Who walk’d away, afflicted at his heart,"
400,18,236,"Shook head, and fear’d that these facts would convert"
400,18,237,"To ill in th’ end; yet had not grace to fly,"
400,18,238,"Minerva stay’d him, being ordain’d to die"
400,18,239,Upon the lance of young Ulyssides.
400,18,240,So down he sat; and then did Pallas please
400,18,241,T’ incline the Queen’s affections to appear
400,18,242,"To all the Wooers, to extend their cheer"
400,18,243,"To th’ utmost lightning that still ushers death,"
400,18,244,"And made her put on all the painted sheath,"
400,18,245,"That might both set her Wooers’ fancies high,"
400,18,246,And get her greater honour in the eye
400,18,247,Ev’n of her son and sov’reign than before.
400,18,248,"Who laughing yet, to show her humour bore"
400,18,249,"No serious appetite to that light show,"
400,18,250,"She told Eurynomé, that not till now"
400,18,251,She ever knew her entertain desire
400,18,252,"To please her Wooers’ eyes, but oft on fire"
400,18,253,"She set their hate, in keeping from them still;"
400,18,254,"Yet now she pleas’d t’ appear, though from no will"
400,18,255,"To do them honour, vowing she would tell"
400,18,256,Her son that of them that should fit him well
400,18,257,"To make use of; which was, not to converse"
400,18,258,"Too freely with their pride, nor to disperse"
400,18,259,"His thoughts amongst them, since they us’d to give"
400,18,260,"Good words, but through them ill intents did drive."
400,18,261,Eurynomé replied: “With good advise
400,18,262,"You vow his counsel, and your open guise."
400,18,263,"Go then, advise your son, nor keep more close"
400,18,264,"Your cheeks, still drown’d in your eyes’ overflows,"
400,18,265,"But bathe your body, and with balms make clear"
400,18,266,"Your thicken’d count’nance. _Uncomposéd cheer,"
400,18,267,"And ever mourning, will the marrow wear._"
400,18,268,Nor have you cause to mourn; your son hath now
400,18,269,"Put on that virtue which, in chief, your vow"
400,18,270,"Wish’d, as your blessing, at his birth, might deck"
400,18,271,His blood and person.” “But forbear to speak
400,18,272,"Of baths, or balmings, or of beauty, now,”"
400,18,273,"The Queen replied, “lest, urging comforts, you"
400,18,274,Discomfort much; because the Gods have won
400,18,275,The spoil of my looks since my lord was gone.
400,18,276,But these must serve. Call hither then to me
400,18,277,"Hippodamia and Autonoé,"
400,18,278,That those our train additions may supply
400,18,279,"Our own deserts. And yet, besides, not I,"
400,18,280,"With all my age, have learn’d the boldness yet"
400,18,281,"T’ expose myself to men, unless I get"
400,18,282,"Some other gracers.” This said, forth she went"
400,18,283,"To call the ladies, and much spirit spent"
400,18,284,"To make their utmost speed, for now their Queen"
400,18,285,"Would both herself show, and make them be seen."
400,18,286,"But now Minerva other projects laid,"
400,18,287,And through Icarius’ daughter’s veins convey’d
400,18,288,Sweet sleep’s desire; in whose soft fumes involv’d
400,18,289,"She was as soon as laid, and quite dissolv’d"
400,18,290,Were all her lineaments. The Goddess then
400,18,291,"Bestow’d immortal gifts on her, that men"
400,18,292,Might wonder at her beauties; and the beams
400,18,293,That glister in the Deified Supremes
400,18,294,She clear’d her mourning count’nance up withall.
400,18,295,Ev’n such a radiance as doth round empall
400,18,296,"Crown’d Cytherea, when her order’d places"
400,18,297,"Conduct the bevy of the dancing Graces,"
400,18,298,"She added to her own; more plump, more high,"
400,18,299,"And fairer than the polish’d ivory,"
400,18,300,"Rend’ring her parts and presence. This grace done,"
400,18,301,Away the Deity flew; and up did run
400,18,302,"Her lovely - wristed ladies, with a noise"
400,18,303,That blew the soft chains from her sleeping joys;
400,18,304,"When she her fair eyes wip’d, and, gasping, said:"
400,18,305,“O me unblest! How deep a sweet sleep spread
400,18,306,His shades about me! Would Diana pleas’d
400,18,307,"To shoot me with a death no more diseas’d,"
400,18,308,"As soon as might be, that no more my moan"
400,18,309,"Might waste my blood in weepings never done,"
400,18,310,For want of that accomplish’d virtue spher’d
400,18,311,"In my lov’d lord, to all the Greeks preferr’d!”"
400,18,312,"Then she descended with her maids, and took"
400,18,313,Place in the portal; whence her beamy look
400,18,314,Reach’d ev’ry Wooer’s heart; yet cast she on
400,18,315,"So thin a veil, that through it quite there shone"
400,18,316,"A grace so stol’n, it pleas’d above the clear,"
400,18,317,"And sunk the knees of ev’ry Wooer there,"
400,18,318,"Their minds so melted in love’s vehement fires,"
400,18,319,That to her bed she heighten’d all desires.
400,18,320,"The prince then coming near, she said: “O son,"
400,18,321,Thy thoughts and judgments have not yet put on
400,18,322,"That constancy in what becomes their good,"
400,18,323,Which all expect in thee. Thy younger blood
400,18,324,"Did sparkle choicer spirits; but, arriv’d"
400,18,325,"At this full growth, wherein their form hath thriv’d"
400,18,326,"Beyond the bounds of childhood, and when now,"
400,18,327,"Beholders should affirm, ‘This man doth grow"
400,18,328,"Like the rare son of his matchless Sire,"
400,18,329,"(His goodliness, his beauty, and his fire"
400,18,330,Of soul aspir’d to)’ thou mak’st nothing good
400,18,331,"Thy fate, nor fortune, nor thy height of blood,"
400,18,332,In manage of thy actions. What a deed
400,18,333,Of foul desert hath thy gross suff’rance freed
400,18,334,Beneath thine own roof! A poor stranger here
400,18,335,Us’d most unmanly! How will this appear
400,18,336,"To all the world, when Fame shall trumpet out,"
400,18,337,"That thus, and thus, are our guests beat about"
400,18,338,Our court unrighted? ’Tis a blaze will show
400,18,339,Extremely shameful to your name and you.”
400,18,340,"“I blame you not, O mother,” he replied,"
400,18,341,"“That, this clear wrong sustain’d by me, you chide;"
400,18,342,"Yet know I both the good and bad of all,"
400,18,343,Being past the years in which young errors fall.
400,18,344,"But, all this known, skill is not so exact"
400,18,345,"To give, when once it knows, things fit their fact."
400,18,346,"I well may doubt the prease of strangers here,"
400,18,347,"Who, bent to ill, and only my nerves near,"
400,18,348,May do it in despite. And yet the jar
400,18,349,Betwixt our guest and Irus was no war
400,18,350,Wrought by the Wooers; nor our guest sustain’d
400,18,351,"Wrong in that action, but the conquest gain’d."
400,18,352,"And would to Jove, Minerva, and the Sun,"
400,18,353,That all your Wooers might serve Contention
400,18,354,"For such a purchase as the beggar made,"
400,18,355,"And wore such weak heads! Some should death invade,"
400,18,356,"Strew’d in the entry, some embrue the hall,"
400,18,357,"Till ev’ry man had vengeance capital,"
400,18,358,"Sattled like Irus at the gates, his head"
400,18,359,"Ev’ry way nodding, like one forfeited"
400,18,360,"To reeling Bacchus, knees nor feet his own,"
400,18,361,To bear him where he’s better lov’d or known.”
400,18,362,"Their speeches giv’n this end, Eurymachus"
400,18,363,"Began his courtship, and express’d it thus:"
400,18,364,"“Most wise Icarius’ daughter! If all those,"
400,18,365,That did for Colchos vent’rous sail dispose
400,18,366,"For that rich purchase, had before but seen"
400,18,367,"Earth’s richer prize in th’ Ithacensian Queen,"
400,18,368,"They had not made that voyage, but to you"
400,18,369,Would all their virtues and their beings vow.
400,18,370,"Should all the world know what a worth you store,"
400,18,371,"To - morrow than to - day, and next light, more"
400,18,372,Your court should banquet; since to all dames you
400,18,373,"Are far preferr’d, both for the grace of show,"
400,18,374,"In stature, beauty, form in ev’ry kind"
400,18,375,"Of all parts outward, and for faultless mind.”"
400,18,376,"“Alas,” said she, “my virtue, body, form,"
400,18,377,The Gods have blasted with that only storm
400,18,378,"That ravish’d Greece to Ilion, since my lord,"
400,18,379,"For that war shipp’d, bore all my goods aboard."
400,18,380,"If he, return’d, should come and govern here"
400,18,381,"My life’s whole state, the grace of all things there"
400,18,382,"His guide would heighten, as the spirit it bore;"
400,18,383,"Which dead in me lives, giv’n him long before."
400,18,384,A sad course I live now; Heav’n’s stern decree
400,18,385,With many an ill hath numb’d and deaded me.
400,18,386,"He took life with him, when he took my hand"
400,18,387,"In parting from me to the Trojan strand,"
400,18,388,These words my witness: ‘Woman! I conceive
400,18,389,That not all th’ Achives bound for Troy shall leave
400,18,390,"Their native earth their safe returnéd bones,"
400,18,391,"Fame saying, that Troy trains up approvéd sons"
400,18,392,"In deeds of arms, brave putters - off of shafts,"
400,18,393,"For winging lances masters of their crafts,"
400,18,394,"Unmatchéd riders, swift of foot, and straight"
400,18,395,Can arbitrate a war of deadliest weight.
400,18,396,"Hope then can scarce fill all with life’s supply,"
400,18,397,"And of all any failing, why not I?"
400,18,398,"Nor do I know, if God hath marshall’d me"
400,18,399,Amongst the safe - return’d; or his decree
400,18,400,Hath left me to the thraldom order’d there.
400,18,401,"However, all cares be thy burthens here,"
400,18,402,"My sire and mother tend as much as now,"
400,18,403,"I further off, more near in cares be you."
400,18,404,"Your son to man’s state grown, wed whom you will;"
400,18,405,"And, you gone, his care let his household fill.’"
400,18,406,"Thus made my lord his will, which Heav’n sees prov’d"
400,18,407,Almost at all parts; for the Sun remov’d
400,18,408,"Down to his set, ere long, will lead the night"
400,18,409,"Of those abhorréd nuptials, that should fright"
400,18,410,"Each worthy woman, which her second are"
400,18,411,"With any man that breathes, her first lord’s care"
400,18,412,"Dead, because he to flesh and blood is dead;"
400,18,413,"Which, I fear, I shall yield to, and so wed"
400,18,414,"A second husband; and my reason is,"
400,18,415,Since Jove hath taken from me all his bliss.
400,18,416,"_Whom God gives over they themselves forsake,"
400,18,417,"Their griefs their joys, their God their devil, make._"
400,18,418,"And ’tis a great grief, nor was seen till now"
400,18,419,In any fashion of such men as woo
400,18,420,"A good and wealthy woman, and contend"
400,18,421,"Who shall obtain her, that those men should spend"
400,18,422,"Her beeves and best sheep, as their chiefest ends,"
400,18,423,But rather that herself and all her friends
400,18,424,They should with banquets and rich gifts entreat.
400,18,425,_Their life is death that live with other’s meat.”_
400,18,426,Divine Ulysses much rejoic’d to hear
400,18,427,"His Queen thus fish for gifts, and keep in cheer."
400,18,428,"Their hearts with hope that she would wed again,"
400,18,429,Her mind yet still her first intent retain.
400,18,430,"Antinous saw the Wooers won to give,"
400,18,431,"And said: “Wise Queen, by all your means receive"
400,18,432,Whatever bounty any Wooer shall use.
400,18,433,Gifts freely giv’n ’tis folly to refuse.
400,18,434,"For know, that we resolve not to be gone"
400,18,435,"To keep our own roofs, till of all some one,"
400,18,436,"Whom best you like, your long - woo’d love shall win.”"
400,18,437,"This pleas’d the rest, and ev’ry one sent in"
400,18,438,His present by the herald. First had place
400,18,439,"Antinous’ gift: A robe of special grace,"
400,18,440,"Exceeding full and fair, and twenty hues"
400,18,441,"Chang’d lustre to it; to which choice of shows,"
400,18,442,"Twelve massy plated buttons, all of gold,"
400,18,443,"Enrich’d the substance, made to fairly hold"
400,18,444,"The robe together, all lac’d down before,"
400,18,445,Where keeps and catches both sides of it wore.
400,18,446,"Eurymachus a golden tablet gave,"
400,18,447,In which did Art her choicest works engrave;
400,18,448,"And round about an amber verge did run,"
400,18,449,That cast a radiance from it like the Sun.
400,18,450,Eurydamas two servants had that bore
400,18,451,"Two goodly earrings, whose rich hollows wore"
400,18,452,"Three pearls in either, like so many eyes,"
400,18,453,Reflecting glances radiant as the skies.
400,18,454,"The king Pisander, great Polyctor’s heir,"
400,18,455,"A casket gave, exceeding rich and fair."
400,18,456,The other other wealthy gifts commended
400,18,457,"To her fair hand; which took, and straight ascended"
400,18,458,This Goddess of her sex her upper state.
400,18,459,Her ladies all her gifts elaborate
400,18,460,Up bearing after. All to dancing then
400,18,461,"The Wooers went, and song’s delightful strain;"
400,18,462,"In which they frolick’d, till the evening came,"
400,18,463,And then rais’d sable Hesperus his flame.
400,18,464,"When, for their lights within, they set up there"
400,18,465,"Three lamps, whose wicks were wood exceeding sere,"
400,18,466,"And passing porous; which they caus’d to burn,"
400,18,467,Their matter ever minister’d by turn
400,18,468,Of sev’ral handmaids. Whom Ulysses seeing
400,18,469,"Too conversant with Wooers, ill - agreeing"
400,18,470,"With guise of maids, advis’d in this fair sort:"
400,18,471,"“Maids of your long - lack’d King, keep you the port"
400,18,472,"Your Queen’s chaste presence bears. Go up to her,"
400,18,473,"Employ your looms, or rocks, and keep ye there;"
400,18,474,"I’ll serve to feed these lamps, should these lords’ dances"
400,18,475,Last till Aurora cheer’d us with their glances.
400,18,476,"They cannot weary me, for I am one"
400,18,477,Born to endure when all men else have done.”
400,18,478,"They wantonly brake out in laughters all,"
400,18,479,Look’d on each other; and to terms did fall
400,18,480,"Cheek - proud Melantho, who was Dolius’ seed,"
400,18,481,"Kept by the Queen, that gave her dainty bread"
400,18,482,Fit for her daughter; and yet won not so
400,18,483,Her heart to her to share in any woe
400,18,484,"She suffer’d for her lord, but she was great"
400,18,485,"With great Eurymachus, and her love’s heat"
400,18,486,In his bed quench’d. And this choleric thing
400,18,487,Bestow’d this railing language on the King:
400,18,488,"“Base stranger, you are taken in your brain,"
400,18,489,You talk so wildly. Never you again
400,18,490,"Can get where you were born, and seek your bed"
400,18,491,"In some smith’s hovel, or the marketsted,"
400,18,492,But here you must take confidence to prate
400,18,493,Before all these; for fear can get no state
400,18,494,In your wine - hardy stomach. Or ’tis like
400,18,495,"To prove your native garb, your tongue will strike"
400,18,496,"On this side of your mouth still, being at best."
400,18,497,Is the man idle - brain’d for want of rest?
400,18,498,Or proud because he beat the roguish beggar?
400,18,499,"Take heed, Sir, lest some better man beleager"
400,18,500,"Your ears with his fists, and set headlong hence"
400,18,501,Your bold abode here with your blood’s expence.”
400,18,502,"He, looking sternly on her, answer’d her:"
400,18,503,“Dog! What broad language giv’st thou? I’ll prefer
400,18,504,"Your usage to the prince, that he may fall"
400,18,505,Foul on your fair limbs till he tell them all.”
400,18,506,"This fray’d the wenches, and all straight got gone"
400,18,507,"In fear about their business, ev’ry one"
400,18,508,Confessing he said well. But he stood now
400,18,509,"Close by the cressets, and did looks bestow"
400,18,510,On all men there; his brain employ’d about
400,18,511,"Some sharper business than to dance it out,"
400,18,512,Which had not long to go. Nor therefore would
400,18,513,Minerva let the Wooers’ spleens grow cold
400,18,514,"With too good usuage of him, that his heart"
400,18,515,"Might fret enough, and make his choler smart."
400,18,516,"Eurymachus provok’d him first, and made"
400,18,517,"His fellow laugh, with a conceit he had"
400,18,518,"Fetch’d far from what was spoken long before,"
400,18,519,That his poor form perhaps some Deity bore.
400,18,520,"“It well may chance,” said he, “some God doth bear"
400,18,521,"This man’s resemblance, for, thus standing near"
400,18,522,"The glist’ring torches, his slick’d head doth throw"
400,18,523,"Beams round about it as those cressets do,"
400,18,524,For not a hair he hath to give it shade.
400,18,525,"Say, will thy heart serve t’ undertake a trade"
400,18,526,For fitting wages? Should I take thee hence
400,18,527,"To walk my grounds, and look to ev’ry fence,"
400,18,528,"Or plant high trees, thy hire should raise thy forces"
400,18,529,"Food store, and clothes. But these same idle courses"
400,18,530,"Thou art so prompt in that thou wilt not work,"
400,18,531,"But forage up and down, and beg, and lurk"
400,18,532,In ev’ry house whose roofs hold any will
400,18,533,"To feed such fellows. That thy gut may fill,"
400,18,534,Gives end to all thy being.” He replied:
400,18,535,"“I wish, at any work we two were tried,"
400,18,536,"In height of spring - time, when heav’n’s lights are long,"
400,18,537,"I a good crook’d scythe that were sharp and strong,"
400,18,538,"You such another, where the grass grew deep,"
400,18,539,"Up by day - break, and both our labours keep"
400,18,540,"Up till slow darkness eas’d the labouring light,"
400,18,541,"Fasting all day, and not a crumb till night;"
400,18,542,We then should prove our either workmanship.
400,18,543,"Or if, again, beeves, that the goad or whip"
400,18,544,"Were apt t’ obey before a tearing plow,"
400,18,545,"Big lusty beasts, alike in bulk and brow,"
400,18,546,"Alike in labour, and alike in strength,"
400,18,547,"Our task four acres, to be till’d in length"
400,18,548,Of one sole day; again: then you should try
400,18,549,"If the dull glebe before the plow - should fly,"
400,18,550,Or I a long stitch could bear clean and even.
400,18,551,"Or lastly, if the Guide of earth and heaven"
400,18,552,"Should stir stern war up, either here or there,"
400,18,553,"And that at this day I had double spear,"
400,18,554,"And shield, and steel casque fitting for my brows;"
400,18,555,"At this work likewise, ’midst the foremost blows,"
400,18,556,"Your eyes should note me, and get little cause"
400,18,557,To twit me with my belly’s sole applause.
400,18,558,"But you affect t’ affect with injury,"
400,18,559,"Your mind ungentle, seem in valour high,"
400,18,560,"Because ’gainst few, and those not of the best,"
400,18,561,Your conversation hath been still profest.
400,18,562,"But if Ulysses, landed on his earth,"
400,18,563,"And enter’d on the true right of his birth,"
400,18,564,"Should come and front ye, straight his ample gates"
400,18,565,Your feet would hold too narrow for your fates.”
400,18,566,"He frown’d, rag’d, call’d him wretch, and vow’d"
400,18,567,"To be his death, since he durst prove so proud"
400,18,568,"Amongst so many, to tell him so home"
400,18,569,"What he affected; ask’d, if overcome"
400,18,570,"With wine he were, or, as his minion said,"
400,18,571,"Talk’d still so idly, and were palsiéd"
400,18,572,"In his mind’s instruments, or was proud because"
400,18,573,He gat from Irus off with such applause?
400,18,574,"With all which, snatching up a stool, he threw;"
400,18,575,When old Ulysses to the knees withdrew
400,18,576,"Of the Dulichian lord, Amphinomus,"
400,18,577,As if he fear’d him. His dart missing thus
400,18,578,"His aged object, and his page’s hand"
400,18,579,"(A boy that waited on his cup’s command,"
400,18,580,"Now holding of an ewer to him) he smit,"
400,18,581,"Down fell the sounding ewer, and after it"
400,18,582,"The guiltless page lay sprawling in the dust,"
400,18,583,And crying out. When all the Wooers thrust
400,18,584,"A tumult up amongst them, wishing all"
400,18,585,"The rogue had perish’d in some hospital,"
400,18,586,"Before his life there stirr’d such uproars up,"
400,18,587,And with rude speeches spice their pleasures’ cup.
400,18,588,And all this for a beggar to fulfill
400,18,589,A filthy proverb: _Good still yields to ill._
400,18,590,"The prince cried out on them, to let the bad"
400,18,591,"Obscure the good so; told them they were mad,"
400,18,592,"Abus’d their banquet, and affirm’d some God"
400,18,593,Tried mast’ries with them; bade them take their load
400,18,594,"Of food and wine, sit up, or fall to bed"
400,18,595,At their free pleasures; and since he gave head
400,18,596,"To all their freedoms, why should they mistake"
400,18,597,Their own rich humours for a beggar’s sake?
400,18,598,"All bit their lips to be so taken down,"
400,18,599,"And taught the course that should have been their own,"
400,18,600,Admir’d the prince; and said he bravely spoke.
400,18,601,"But Nisus’ son then struck the equal stroke,"
400,18,602,"And said: “O friends, let no man here disdain"
400,18,603,"To put up equal speeches, nor maintain"
400,18,604,"With serious words an humour, nor with stroke"
400,18,605,"A stranger in another’s house provoke,"
400,18,606,"Nor touch the meanest servant, but confine"
400,18,607,All these dissentions in a bowl of wine;
400,18,608,"Which fill us, cup - bearer, that, having done"
400,18,609,"Our nightly sacrifice, we may atone"
400,18,610,"Our pow’rs with sleep, resigning first the guest"
400,18,611,"Up to the prince, that holds all interest"
400,18,612,In his disposure here; the house being his
400,18,613,"In just descent, and all the faculties.”"
400,18,614,"This all approv’d; when noble Mulius,"
400,18,615,"Herald - in - chief to lord Amphinomus,"
400,18,616,The wine distributed with rev’rend grace
400,18,617,To ev’ry Wooer; when the Gods giv’n place;
400,18,618,"With service fit; they serv’d themselves, and took"
400,18,619,"Their parting cups, till, when they all had shook"
400,18,620,"The angry humour off, they bent to rest,"
400,18,621,And ev’ry Wooer to sev’ral roofs addrest.
400,18,622,THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK OF HOMER’S ODYSSEYS.
400,19,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,19,2,Ulysses and his son eschew
400,19,3,Offending of the Wooers’ view
400,19,4,"With any armour. His birth’s seat,"
400,19,5,"Ulysses tells his Queen, is Crete,"
400,19,6,"Euryclea the truth yet found,"
400,19,7,"Discover’d by a scar - heal’d wound,"
400,19,8,"Which in Parnassus’ tops a boar,"
400,19,9,"Struck by him in his chace, did gore."
400,19,10,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,19,11,_Ταυ̑._
400,19,12,The King still hid
400,19,13,By what he said;
400,19,14,By what he did
400,19,15,Informs his maid.
400,19,16,"Yet did divine Ulysses keep his roof,"
400,19,17,And with Minerva plotted still the proof
400,19,18,Of all the Wooers’ deaths; when thus his son
400,19,19,He taught with these fore - counsels: “We must run
400,19,20,"A close course with these arms, and lay them by,"
400,19,21,And to the Wooers make so fair a sky
400,19,22,"As it would never thunder. Let me then,"
400,19,23,"That you may well retain, repeat again"
400,19,24,What in Eumæus’ cottage I advis’d:
400,19,25,"If when they see no leisure exercis’d,"
400,19,26,"In fetching down your arms, and ask what use"
400,19,27,"Your mind will give them, say, ’tis their abuse"
400,19,28,"With smoke and rust that makes you take them down,"
400,19,29,This not being like the armory well - known
400,19,30,To be the leavings of Laertes’ son
400,19,31,Consorting the design for Ilion;
400,19,32,"Your eyes may see how much they are infected,"
400,19,33,As all fires’ vapours ever since reflected
400,19,34,"On those sole arms. Besides, a graver thought"
400,19,35,"Jove graves within you, lest, their spirits wrought"
400,19,36,"Above their pitch with wine, they might contend"
400,19,37,"At some high banquet, and to wounds transcend,"
400,19,38,"Their feast inverting; which, perhaps, may be"
400,19,39,Their nuptial feast with wise Penelopé.
400,19,40,"_The ready weapon, when the blood is up,"
400,19,41,Doubles the uproar heighten’d by the cup.
400,19,42,"Wrath’s means for act, curb all the ways ye can,"
400,19,43,"As loadstones draw the steel, so steel draws man._"
400,19,44,"Retain these words; nor what is good think, thus"
400,19,45,"Receiv’d at second hand, superfluous.”"
400,19,46,"The son, obeying, did Euryclea call,"
400,19,47,And bade her shut in th’ utter porches all
400,19,48,"The other women, till himself brought down"
400,19,49,"His father’s arms, which all were overgrown"
400,19,50,"By his neglect with rust, his father gone,"
400,19,51,And he too - childish to spend thoughts upon
400,19,52,Those manly implements; but he would now
400,19,53,"Reform those young neglects, and th’ arms bestow"
400,19,54,Past reach of smoke. The loving nurse replied:
400,19,55,"“I wish, O son, your pow’rs would once provide"
400,19,56,"For wisdom’s habit, see your household were"
400,19,57,"In thrifty manage, and tend all things there."
400,19,58,"But if these arms must down, and ev’ry maid"
400,19,59,"Be shut in utter rooms, who else should aid"
400,19,60,Your work with light?” He answer’d: “This my guest.
400,19,61,"There shall no one in my house taste my feast,"
400,19,62,"Or join in my nave, that shall idly live,[1]"
400,19,63,However far hence he his home derive.”
400,19,64,"He said, and his words stood. The doors she shut"
400,19,65,Of that so well - fill’d house. And th’ other put
400,19,66,"Their thoughts in act; best shields, helms, sharpen’d lances,"
400,19,67,Brought down; and Pallas before both advances
400,19,68,"A golden cresset, that did cast a light"
400,19,69,As if the Day sat in the throne of Night.
400,19,70,"When, half - amaz’d, the prince said: “O my father,"
400,19,71,"Mine eyes my soul’s pow’rs all in wonder gather,"
400,19,72,"For though the walls, and goodly wind - beams here,"
400,19,73,"All all these pillars, that their heads so rear,"
400,19,74,"And all of fir, they seem yet all of fire."
400,19,75,Some God is surely with us.” His wise sire
400,19,76,"Bade peace, and keep the counsels of the Gods,"
400,19,77,"Nor ask a word: “These Pow’rs, that use abodes"
400,19,78,"Above the stars, have pow’r from thence to shine"
400,19,79,Through night and all shades to earth’s inmost mine.
400,19,80,"Go thou for sleep, and leave me here to wake"
400,19,81,"The women, and the Queen whose heart doth ache"
400,19,82,To make inquiry for myself of me.”
400,19,83,He went to sleep where lights did endlessly
400,19,84,"Burn in his night - rooms; where he feasted rest,"
400,19,85,Till day’s fair weed did all the world invest.
400,19,86,Thus was divine Ulysses left alone
400,19,87,"With Pallas, plotting foul confusion"
400,19,88,To all the Wooers. Forth then came the Queen;
400,19,89,"Phœbe, with golden Cytherea seen,"
400,19,90,Her port presented. Whom they set a chair
400,19,91,"Aside the fire, the fashion circular,"
400,19,92,The substance silver and rich elephant;
400,19,93,Whose fabric did the cunning finger vaunt
400,19,94,"Of great Icmalius, who besides had done"
400,19,95,"A footstool for her that did suit her throne,"
400,19,96,"On which they cast an ample skin, to be"
400,19,97,The cushion for her other royalty.
400,19,98,"And there she sat; about whom came her maids,"
400,19,99,"Who brought upon a table store of breads,"
400,19,100,And bowls that with the Wooers’ wine were crown’d.
400,19,101,The embers then they cast upon the ground
400,19,102,"From out the lamps, and other fuel added,"
400,19,103,That still with cheerful flame the sad house gladded.
400,19,104,"Melantha seeing still Ulysses there,"
400,19,105,"Thus she held out her spleen: “Still, stranger, here?"
400,19,106,Thus late in night? To see what ladies do?
400,19,107,"Avaunt you, wretch, hence, go without doors, go;"
400,19,108,"And quickly, too, lest ye be singed away"
400,19,109,"With burning firebrands.” He, thus seeing their fray"
400,19,110,"Continued by her with such spleen, replied:"
400,19,111,“Minion! What makes your angry blood thus chide
400,19,112,My presence still? Is it because you see
400,19,113,"I shine not in your wanton bravery,"
400,19,114,But wear these rags? It fits the needy fate
400,19,115,That makes me beg thus of the common state.
400,19,116,"Such poor souls, and such beggars, yet are men;"
400,19,117,And ev’n my mean means means had to maintain
400,19,118,"A wealthy house, and kept a manly press,"
400,19,119,"Was counted blessed, and the poor access"
400,19,120,"Of any beggar did not scorn, but feed,"
400,19,121,"With often hand, and any man of need"
400,19,122,"Reliev’d as fitted; kept my servants, too,"
400,19,123,"Not few, but did with those additions go"
400,19,124,"That call choice men _The Honest_, who are styl’d"
400,19,125,"The rich, the great. But what such great ones build"
400,19,126,"Jove oft pulls down, as thus he ruin’d me;"
400,19,127,"His will was such, which is his equity."
400,19,128,"And therefore, woman, bear you fitting hand"
400,19,129,"On your behaviour, lest your spirit thus mann’d,"
400,19,130,"And cherish’d with your beauties, when they wane,"
400,19,131,"Comes down, your pride now being then your bane;"
400,19,132,"And in the mean space shun the present danger,"
400,19,133,"Lest your bold fashion breed your sov’reign’s anger,"
400,19,134,"Or lest Ulysses come, of whom ev’n yet"
400,19,135,"Hope finds some life in Fate. Or, be his seat"
400,19,136,"Amongst the merely ruin’d, yet his son,"
400,19,137,"Whose life’s heat Phœbus saves, is such a one"
400,19,138,As can discover who doth well deserve
400,19,139,Of any woman here his years now serve.”
400,19,140,"The Queen gave ear, and thus suppress’d the flame:"
400,19,141,"“Thou quite without a brow, past female shame,"
400,19,142,"I hear thy monstrous boldness, which thy head"
400,19,143,"Shall pay me pains for. Thou hast heard it said,"
400,19,144,"And from myself too, and ev’ry part"
400,19,145,"Thy knowledge serves thee, that, to ease my heart"
400,19,146,"So punish’d in thy witness, my desire"
400,19,147,"Dwelt on this stranger, that I might inquire"
400,19,148,"My lost friend’s being. But ’tis ever tried,"
400,19,149,_Both man and God are still forgot with pride._
400,19,150,"Eurynomé, bring here this guest a seat,"
400,19,151,"And cushion on it, that we two may treat"
400,19,152,"Of the affair in question. Set it near,"
400,19,153,"That I may softly speak, yet he well hear.”"
400,19,154,She did this little freely; and he sat
400,19,155,"Close by the Queen, who ask’d him, Whence, and what"
400,19,156,He was himself? And what th’ inhabited place
400,19,157,Where liv’d his parents? Whence he fetch’d his race?
400,19,158,"“O woman,” he replied, “with whom no man,"
400,19,159,"That moves in earth’s unbounded circle, can"
400,19,160,"Maintain contention for true honour giv’n,"
400,19,161,"Whose fame hath reach’d the fairly - flowing heav’n,"
400,19,162,"Who, like a never - ill - deserving king,"
400,19,163,"That is well - spoke of, first, for worshipping,"
400,19,164,And striving to resemble God in empire;
400,19,165,Whose equal hand impartially doth temper
400,19,166,Greatness and Goodness; to whom therefore bears
400,19,167,"The black earth store of all grain, trees confers"
400,19,168,"Cracking with burthen, long - liv’d herds creates,"
400,19,169,All which the sea with her sorts emulates;
400,19,170,And all this feeds beneath his pow’rful hand
400,19,171,"Men, valiant, many, making strong his land"
400,19,172,With happy lives led; nothing else the cause
400,19,173,"Of all these blessings, but well - order’d laws;"
400,19,174,"Like such a king are you, in love, in fame,"
400,19,175,And all the bliss that deifies a dame.
400,19,176,And therefore do not mix this with a moan
400,19,177,So wretched as is now in question;
400,19,178,"Ask not my race nor country, lest you fill"
400,19,179,My heart yet fuller with repeated ill;
400,19,180,"For I must follow it with many tears,"
400,19,181,Though ’tis not seemly to sit wounding ears
400,19,182,In public roofs with our particular life.
400,19,183,_Time’s worst expense is still - repeated grief._
400,19,184,"I should be irksome to your ladies here,"
400,19,185,And you yourself would say you urg’d your ear
400,19,186,"To what offends it, my still - broken eyne"
400,19,187,Supposing wounded with your too - much wine.”
400,19,188,"“Stranger,” said she, “you fear your own excess"
400,19,189,With giving me too great a nobleness.
400,19,190,"The Gods my person, beauty, virtue too,"
400,19,191,"Long since subverted, when the Ilion woe"
400,19,192,The Greek design attempted; in which went
400,19,193,My praise and honour. In his government
400,19,194,"Had I deserv’d your utmost grace, but now"
400,19,195,"Sinister Deity makes dishonour woo,"
400,19,196,"In show of grace, my ruin. All the peers"
400,19,197,"Sylvan Zacynthus, and Dulichius, spheres,"
400,19,198,"Samos and Ithaca, strange strifes have shown"
400,19,199,"To win me, spending on me all mine own;"
400,19,200,"Will wed me, in my spite; and these are those"
400,19,201,That take from me all virtue to dispose
400,19,202,"Or guest or suppliant, or take any course"
400,19,203,"Amongst my heralds, that should all disburse,"
400,19,204,To order anything. Though I need none
400,19,205,"To give me grief at home, abroad errs one"
400,19,206,"That my veins shrink for, whom these holding gone,"
400,19,207,"Their nuptials hasten, and find me as slow."
400,19,208,Good spirits prompted me to make a show
400,19,209,"Of undertaking a most curious task,"
400,19,210,That an unmeasur’d space of time would ask;
400,19,211,"Which they enduring long would often say,"
400,19,212,"When ends thy work? I soon had my delay,"
400,19,213,"And pray’d their stay; for though my lord were dead,"
400,19,214,His father’s life yet matter ministred
400,19,215,"That must employ me; which, to tell them true,"
400,19,216,Was that great work I nam’d. For now near drew
400,19,217,"Laertes’ death, and on my hand did lie"
400,19,218,"His funeral - robe, whose end, being now so nigh,"
400,19,219,"I must not leave, and lose so much begun,"
400,19,220,The rather lest the Greek dames might be won
400,19,221,"To tax mine honour, if a man so great"
400,19,222,Should greet his grave without his winding sheet.
400,19,223,"Pride made them credulous, and I went on;"
400,19,224,When whatsoever all the day had done
400,19,225,"I made the night help to undo again,"
400,19,226,"Though oil and watch it cost, and equal pain."
400,19,227,"Three years my wit secur’d me undiscern’d,"
400,19,228,"Yet, when the fourth came, by my maids discern’d,"
400,19,229,"False careless wenches, how they were deluded;"
400,19,230,"When, by my light discern’d, they all intruded,"
400,19,231,"Used threat’ning words, and made me give it end;"
400,19,232,And then could I to no more length extend
400,19,233,My linger’d nuptials; not a counsel more
400,19,234,Was to be stood upon; my parents bore
400,19,235,Continual hand on me to make me wed;
400,19,236,My son grew angry that so ruinéd
400,19,237,His goods were by them. He is now a man
400,19,238,"Wise in a great degree, and one that can"
400,19,239,Himself give order to his household fare;
400,19,240,And Jove give equal glory to his care.
400,19,241,"But thus you must not pass me; I must know,"
400,19,242,"It may be for more end, from whence doth grow"
400,19,243,Your race and you; for I suppose you none
400,19,244,"Sprung of old oak, or justled out of stone.”"
400,19,245,He answer’d: “O Ulysses’ rev’rend wife!
400,19,246,Yet hold you purpose to inquire my life?
400,19,247,"I’ll tell you, though it much afflict me more"
400,19,248,Than all the sorrows I have felt before.
400,19,249,"As worthily it may, since so long time"
400,19,250,"As I have wander’d from my native clime,"
400,19,251,"Through human cities, and in suff’rance still,"
400,19,252,"To rip all wounds up, though of all their ill"
400,19,253,"I touch but part, must actuate all their pain."
400,19,254,"But, ask you still, I’ll tell, though still sustain."
400,19,255,In middle of the sable sea there lies
400,19,256,"An isle call’d Crete, a ravisher of eyes,"
400,19,257,"Fruitful, and mann’d with many an infinite store;"
400,19,258,"Where ninety cities crown the famous shore,"
400,19,259,"Mix’d with all - languag’d men. There Greeks survive,"
400,19,260,"There the great - minded Eteocretans live,"
400,19,261,"There the Dorensians never out of war,"
400,19,262,"The Cydons there, and there the singular"
400,19,263,"Pelasgian people. There doth Cnossus stand,"
400,19,264,"That mighty city, where had most command"
400,19,265,"Great Jove’s disciple, Minos, who nine years"
400,19,266,"Conferr’d with Jove, both great familiars"
400,19,267,"In mutual counsels. And this Minos’ son,"
400,19,268,"The mighty - minded king Deucalion,"
400,19,269,"Was sire to me and royal Idomen,"
400,19,270,"Who with Atrides went to Ilion then,"
400,19,271,"My elder brother and the better man,"
400,19,272,My name Aethon. At that time began
400,19,273,"My knowledge of Ulysses, whom my home"
400,19,274,Receiv’d with guest - rites. He was thither come
400,19,275,"By force of weather, from the Malean coast"
400,19,276,"But new got off, where he the navy lost,"
400,19,277,"Then under sail for Troy, and wind - bound lay"
400,19,278,Long in Amnisus; hardly got away
400,19,279,"From horrid storms, that made him anchor there,"
400,19,280,"In havens that sacred to Lucina were,"
400,19,281,"Dreadful and dang’rous, in whose bosom crept"
400,19,282,Lucina’s cavern. But in my roof slept
400,19,283,"Ulysses, shor’d in Crete; who first inquir’d"
400,19,284,"For royal Idomen, and much desir’d"
400,19,285,"To taste his guest - rites, since to him had been"
400,19,286,A welcome guest my brother Idomen.
400,19,287,The tenth or ’leventh light on Ulysses shin’d
400,19,288,"In stay at Crete, attending then the wind"
400,19,289,For threaten’d Ilion. All which time my house
400,19,290,With love and entertainments curious
400,19,291,"Embrac’d his person, though a number more"
400,19,292,"My hospitable roofs receiv’d before,"
400,19,293,"His men I likewise call’d, and from the store"
400,19,294,"Allow’d them meal and heat - exciting wine,"
400,19,295,"And oxen for their slaughter, to confine"
400,19,296,In my free hand the utmost of their need.
400,19,297,"Twelve days the Greeks stay’d, ere they got them freed,"
400,19,298,"A gale so bitter blew out of the north,"
400,19,299,"That none could stand on earth, being tumbled forth"
400,19,300,By some stern God. But on the thirteenth day
400,19,301,"The tempest ceas’d, and then went Greeks their way.”"
400,19,302,"Thus many tales Ulysses told his wife,"
400,19,303,"At most but painting, yet most like the life;"
400,19,304,"Of which her heart such sense took through her ears,"
400,19,305,It made her weep as she would turn to tears.
400,19,306,"And as from off the mountains melts the snow,"
400,19,307,"Which Zephyr’s breath conceal’d, but was made flow"
400,19,308,"By hollow Eurus, which so fast pours down,"
400,19,309,That with their torrent floods have overflown;
400,19,310,"So down her fair cheeks her kind tears did glide,"
400,19,311,Her miss’d lord mourning set so near her side.
400,19,312,"Ulysses much was mov’d to see her mourn,"
400,19,313,Whose eyes yet stood as dry as iron or horn
400,19,314,"In his untroubled lids, which in his craft"
400,19,315,Of bridling passion he from issue saft.
400,19,316,"When she had giv’n her moan so many tears,"
400,19,317,"That now ’twas satiate, her yet loving fears"
400,19,318,Ask’d thus much further: “You have thus far tried
400,19,319,"My love’s credulity, but if gratified"
400,19,320,"With so long stay he was with you, you can"
400,19,321,"Describe what weed he wore, what kind of man"
400,19,322,"Both he himself was, and what followers"
400,19,323,"Observ’d him there.” “Alas,” said he, “the years"
400,19,324,Have grown so many since — this making now
400,19,325,Their twentieth revolution — that my show
400,19,326,"Of these slight notes will set my memory sore,"
400,19,327,"But, to my now remembrance, this he wore:"
400,19,328,"A double purple robe, drawn close before"
400,19,329,"With golden buttons, plaited thick, and bore"
400,19,330,A facing where a hundred colours shin’d.
400,19,331,About the skirts a hound a freckled hind
400,19,332,"In full course hunted; on the fore skirts, yet,"
400,19,333,"He pinch’d and pull’d her down, when with her feet,"
400,19,334,"And all her force, she struggled hard for flight."
400,19,335,"Which had such life in gold, that to the sight"
400,19,336,"It seem’d the hind itself for ev’ry hue,"
400,19,337,"The hound and all so answering the view,"
400,19,338,That all admir’d all. I observ’d beside
400,19,339,"His inner weed, so rarely beautified"
400,19,340,"That dumb amaze it bred, and was as thin"
400,19,341,As any dry and tender onion skin;
400,19,342,"As soft ’twas, too, and glister’d like the sun."
400,19,343,The women were to loving wonder won
400,19,344,"By him and by his weeds. But, by the way,"
400,19,345,"You must excuse me, that I cannot say"
400,19,346,"He brought this suit from home, or had it there"
400,19,347,"Sent for some present, or, perhaps, elsewhere"
400,19,348,Receiv’d it for his guest - gift; for your lord
400,19,349,"Had friends not few, the fleet did not afford"
400,19,350,Many that had not fewer. I bestow’d
400,19,351,"A well - edg’d sword on him, a robe that flow’d"
400,19,352,"In folds and fulness, and did reach his feet,"
400,19,353,Of richest purple; brought him to his fleet
400,19,354,"With all my honour; and besides, to add"
400,19,355,"To all this sifted circumstance, he had"
400,19,356,"A herald there, in height a little more"
400,19,357,"Put from the earth, that thicker shoulders wore,"
400,19,358,"A swarth complexion and a curléd head,"
400,19,359,His name Eurybates; and much in stead
400,19,360,"He stood your king, employ’d in most command,"
400,19,361,Since most of all his mind could understand.”
400,19,362,"When all these signs she knew for chiefly true,"
400,19,363,"Desire of moan upon her beauties grew,"
400,19,364,"And yet, ev’n that desire suffic’d, she said:"
400,19,365,"“Till this, my guest, a wretched state array’d"
400,19,366,"Your ill - us’d person, but from this hour forth"
400,19,367,"You shall be honour’d, and find all the worth"
400,19,368,That fits a friend. Those weeds these hands bestow’d
400,19,369,From out my wardrobe; those gold buttons sew’d
400,19,370,Before for closure and for ornament.
400,19,371,But never more must his return present
400,19,372,The person that gave those adornments state;
400,19,373,"And therefore, under an abhorréd fate,"
400,19,374,"Was he induc’d to feed the common fame,"
400,19,375,"To visit vile Troy, ay too vile to name.”"
400,19,376,"“No more yet mourn,” said he, “nor thus see pin’d"
400,19,377,Your lovely person. _Weeping wastes the mind._
400,19,378,And yet I blame you not; for any dame
400,19,379,"That weds one young, and brings to him his name,"
400,19,380,"Whatever man he is, will mourn his loss."
400,19,381,Much more respectful then must show your woes
400,19,382,"That weep thus for Ulysses, who, Fame says,"
400,19,383,Was equal with the Gods in all his ways.
400,19,384,"But where no cause is there must be no moan,"
400,19,385,"And therefore hear me, my relation"
400,19,386,Shall lay the clear truth naked to your view:
400,19,387,"I heard amongst the Thesprots for most true,"
400,19,388,"That lord Ulysses liv’d, and stood just now"
400,19,389,On his return for home; that wealth did flow
400,19,390,"In his possession, which he made not known,"
400,19,391,"But begg’d amongst the people, since alone"
400,19,392,"He quite was left, for all his men were lost"
400,19,393,In getting off from the Trinacrian coast;
400,19,394,Jove and the Sun was wroth with them for rape
400,19,395,"Made of his oxen, and no man let ’scape"
400,19,396,"The rugged deeps of Neptune; only he,"
400,19,397,"The ship’s keel only keeping, was by sea"
400,19,398,"Cast on the fair Phæacian continent,"
400,19,399,"Where men survive that are the Gods’ descent,"
400,19,400,"And like a God receiv’d him, gave him heaps"
400,19,401,"Of wealthy gifts, and would conduct his steps"
400,19,402,Themselves safe home; which he might long ago
400,19,403,"His pleasure make, but profit would not so."
400,19,404,"He gather’d going, and had mighty store"
400,19,405,Of gold in safeguard; so beyond the shore
400,19,406,"That common sails kept, his high flood of wit"
400,19,407,"Bore glorious top, and all the world for it"
400,19,408,"Hath far exceeded. All this Phædon told,"
400,19,409,"That doth the sceptre of Thesprotia hold,"
400,19,410,"Who swore to me, in household sacrifice,"
400,19,411,"The ship was launch’d, and men to man the prise,"
400,19,412,"That soon should set him on his country earth,"
400,19,413,"Show’d me the goods, enough to serve the birth"
400,19,414,"That in the tenth age of his seed should spring,"
400,19,415,"Yet in his court contain’d. But then the king,"
400,19,416,"Your husband, for Dodona was in way,"
400,19,417,That from th’ Oraculous Oak he might display
400,19,418,"Jove’s will what course for home would best prevail,"
400,19,419,"To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail."
400,19,420,"But me the king dispatch’d in course before,"
400,19,421,A ship then bound for the Dulichian shore.
400,19,422,So thus you see his safety whom you mourn;
400,19,423,"Who now is passing near, and his return"
400,19,424,"No more will punish with delays, but see"
400,19,425,His friends and country. All which truth to thee
400,19,426,"I’ll seal with sacred oath. Be witness, Jove,"
400,19,427,Thou first and best of all the thron’d above!
400,19,428,"And thou house of the great Laertes’ heir,"
400,19,429,"To whose high roofs I tender my repair,"
400,19,430,That what I tell the Queen event shall crown!
400,19,431,"This year Ulysses shall possess his own,"
400,19,432,"Nay ere the next month ends shall here arrive,"
400,19,433,"Nay, ere it enters, here abide alive!”"
400,19,434,"“O may this prove,” said she; “gifts, friendship, then"
400,19,435,Should make your name the most renown’d of men.
400,19,436,"But ’tis of me receiv’d, and must so sort,"
400,19,437,"That nor my lord shall ever see his court,"
400,19,438,"Nor you gain your deduction thence, for now"
400,19,439,The alter’d house doth no such man allow
400,19,440,"As was Ulysses, if he ever were,"
400,19,441,"To entertain a rev’rend passenger,"
400,19,442,"And give him fair dismission. But, maids, see"
400,19,443,"Ye bathe his feet, and then with tapestry,"
400,19,444,"Best sheets and blankets, make his bed, and lay"
400,19,445,"Soft waistcoats by him, that, lodg’d warm, he may"
400,19,446,Ev’n till the golden - seated morning’s ray
400,19,447,"Enjoy good rest; and then, with her first light,"
400,19,448,"Bathe, and give alms, that cherish’d appetite"
400,19,449,"He may apply within our hall, and sit"
400,19,450,"Safe by Telemachus. Or, if th’ unfit"
400,19,451,And harmful mind of any be so base
400,19,452,"To grieve his age again, let none give grace"
400,19,453,"Of doing any deed he shall command,"
400,19,454,"How wroth soever, to his barbarous hand."
400,19,455,"For how shall you, guest, know me for a dame"
400,19,456,"That pass so far, nay, turn and wind the fame"
400,19,457,"Of other dames for wisdom, and the frame"
400,19,458,"Of household usage, if your poor thin weeds"
400,19,459,"I let draw on you want, and worser deeds,"
400,19,460,"That may, perhaps, cause here your latest day?"
400,19,461,_The life of man is short and flies away._
400,19,462,And if the ruler’s self of households be
400,19,463,"Ungentle, studying inhumanity,"
400,19,464,"The rest prove worse, but he bears all the blame;"
400,19,465,"All men will, living, vow against his name"
400,19,466,"Mischiefs and miseries, and, dead, supply"
400,19,467,With bitter epitaphs his memory.
400,19,468,But if himself be noble — noble things
400,19,469,Doing and knowing — all his underlings
400,19,470,"Will imitate his noblesse, and all guests"
400,19,471,"Give it, in many, many interests.”"
400,19,472,"“But, worthiest Queen,” said he, “where you command"
400,19,473,"Baths and rich beds for me, I scorn to stand"
400,19,474,"On such state now nor ever thought it yet,"
400,19,475,Since first I left the snowy hills of Crete.
400,19,476,When once I fell a - shipboard those thoughts fled;
400,19,477,"I love to take now, as long since, my bed."
400,19,478,"Though I began the use with sleepless nights,"
400,19,479,I many a darkness with right homely rites
400,19,480,"Have spent ere this hour, and desir’d the morn"
400,19,481,"Would come, and make sleep to the world a scorn."
400,19,482,Nor run these dainty baths in my rude head;
400,19,483,"Nor any handmaid, to your service bred,"
400,19,484,"Shall touch my ill - kept feet, unless there live"
400,19,485,"Some poor old drudge here, that hath learn’d to give"
400,19,486,"Old men good usage, and no work will fly,"
400,19,487,As having suffer’d ill as much as I.
400,19,488,"But if there live one such in your command,"
400,19,489,I will not shame to give my foot her hand.”
400,19,490,"She gave this answer: “O my lovéd guest,"
400,19,491,There never enter’d these kind roofs for rest
400,19,492,Stranger or friend that so much wisdom laid
400,19,493,"In gage for guest - rites, as your lips have paid."
400,19,494,There lives an old maid in my charge that knows
400,19,495,The good you speak of by her many woes;
400,19,496,"That nourish’d and brought up, with curious care,"
400,19,497,"Th’ unhappy man; your old familiar,"
400,19,498,"Ev’n since his mother let him view the light,"
400,19,499,And oft hath felt in her weak arms his weight;
400,19,500,"And she, though now much weaker, shall apply"
400,19,501,Her maiden service to your modesty.
400,19,502,"Euryclea, rise, and wash the feet of one"
400,19,503,"That is of one age with your sov’reign gone,"
400,19,504,"Such hands, such feet hath, though of alter’d grace."
400,19,505,_Much grief in men will bring on change apace.”_
400,19,506,"She, from her aged slumber wak’d, did clear"
400,19,507,"Her heavy eyes, and instantly, to hear"
400,19,508,"Her sov’reign’s name, had work enough to dry"
400,19,509,"Her cheeks from tears, and to his memory"
400,19,510,"These moans did offer: “O my son,” said she,"
400,19,511,"“I never can take grief enough for thee,"
400,19,512,"Whom Goodness hurts, and whom ev’n Jove’s high spleen,"
400,19,513,"Since thou art Jove - like, hates the most of men."
400,19,514,"For none hath offer’d him so many thighs,"
400,19,515,"Nor such whole hecatombs of sacrifice,"
400,19,516,"Fat and selected, as thy zeal hath done;"
400,19,517,"For all, but praying that thy noble son,"
400,19,518,Thy happy age might see at state of man.
400,19,519,And yet hath Jove with mists Cimmerian
400,19,520,Put out the light of his returning day.
400,19,521,"And as yourself, O father, in your way"
400,19,522,"Took these fair roofs for hospitable rites,"
400,19,523,"Yet find, for them, our dogged women’s spites;"
400,19,524,"So he, in like course, being driven to proof,"
400,19,525,"Long time ere this, what such a royal roof"
400,19,526,"Would yield his mis’ries, found such usage there."
400,19,527,"And you, now flying the foul language here,"
400,19,528,"And many a filthy fact of our fair dames,"
400,19,529,"Fly me like them, and put on causeless shames"
400,19,530,To let me cleanse your feet. For not the cause
400,19,531,The Queen’s command yields is the pow’r that draws
400,19,532,"My will to wash your feet, but what I do"
400,19,533,Proceeds from her charge and your rev’rence too;
400,19,534,Since I in soul am stricken with a ruth
400,19,535,"Of your distresses, and past show of truth;[2]"
400,19,536,Your strangeness claiming little interest
400,19,537,In my affections. And yet many a guest
400,19,538,"Of poor condition hath been harbour’d here,"
400,19,539,But never any did so right appear
400,19,540,"Like king Ulysses as yourself, for state"
400,19,541,"Both of your stature, voice, and very gait.”"
400,19,542,"“So all have said,” said he, “that ever yet"
400,19,543,Had the proportions of our figures met
400,19,544,In their observance; so right your eye
400,19,545,Proves in your soul your judging faculty.”
400,19,546,"Thus took she up a caldron brightly scour’d,"
400,19,547,To cleanse his feet in; and into it pour’d
400,19,548,"Store of cold wave, which on the fire she set;"
400,19,549,"And therein bath’d, being temperately heat,"
400,19,550,"Her sov’reign’s feet. Who turn’d him from the light,"
400,19,551,"Since suddenly he doubted her conceit,"
400,19,552,"So rightly touching at his state before,"
400,19,553,"A scar now seeing on his foot, that bore"
400,19,554,"An old note, to discern him, might descry"
400,19,555,"The absolute truth; which, witness’d by her eye,"
400,19,556,Was straight approv’d. He first receiv’d this sore
400,19,557,As in Parnassus’ tops a white - tooth’d boar
400,19,558,"He stood in chase withal, who struck him there,"
400,19,559,At such time as he liv’d a sojourner
400,19,560,"With his grandsire, Autolycus; who th’ art"
400,19,561,"Of theft and swearing (not out of the heart,"
400,19,562,But by equivocation) first adorn’d
400,19,563,"Your witty man withal, and was suborn’d"
400,19,564,"By Jove’s descent, ingenious Mercury,"
400,19,565,"Who did bestow it, since so many a thigh"
400,19,566,Of lambs and kids he had on him bestow’d
400,19,567,"In sacred flames, who therefore when he vow’d"
400,19,568,Was ever with him. And this man impos’d
400,19,569,"Ulysses’ name, the light being first disclos’d"
400,19,570,"To his first sight then, when his grandsire came"
400,19,571,"To see the then preferrer of his fame,"
400,19,572,"His lovéd daughter. The first supper done,"
400,19,573,"Euryclea put in his lap her son,"
400,19,574,"And pray’d him to bethink and give his name,"
400,19,575,Since that desire did all desires inflame.
400,19,576,"“Daughter and son - in - law,” said he, “let then"
400,19,577,The name that I shall give him stand with men.
400,19,578,"Since I arriv’d here at the hour of pain,"
400,19,579,In which mine own kind entrails did sustain
400,19,580,"Moan for my daughter’s yet unended throes,"
400,19,581,"And when so many men’s and women’s woes,"
400,19,582,"In joint compassion met of human birth,"
400,19,583,"Brought forth t’ attend the many - feeding earth,"
400,19,584,"Let Odyssëus be his name, as one[3]"
400,19,585,Expos’d to just constraint of all men’s moan.
400,19,586,When here at home he is arriv’d at state
400,19,587,Of man’s first youth he shall initiate
400,19,588,"His practis’d feet in travel made abroad,"
400,19,589,"And to Parnassus, where mine own abode"
400,19,590,"And chief means lie, address his way, where I"
400,19,591,Will give him from my open’d treasury
400,19,592,"What shall return him well, and fit the fame"
400,19,593,Of one that had the honour of his name.”
400,19,594,"For these fair gifts he went, and found all grace"
400,19,595,Of hands and words in him and all his race.
400,19,596,"Amphithea, his mother’s mother, too,"
400,19,597,"Applied her to his love, withal, to do"
400,19,598,"In grandame’s welcomes, both his fair eyes kist,"
400,19,599,And brows; and then commanded to assist
400,19,600,Were all her sons by their respected sire
400,19,601,"In furnishing a feast, whose ears did fire"
400,19,602,Their minds with his command; who home straight led
400,19,603,"A five - years - old male ox, fell’d, slew, and flay’d,"
400,19,604,"Gather’d about him, cut him up with art,"
400,19,605,"Spitted, and roasted, and his ev’ry part"
400,19,606,Divided orderly. So all the day
400,19,607,They spent in feast; no one man went his way
400,19,608,"Without his fit fill. When the sun was set,"
400,19,609,"And darkness rose, they slept, till day’s fire het"
400,19,610,Th’ enlighten’d earth; and then on hunting went
400,19,611,Both hounds and all Autolycus’ descent.
400,19,612,"In whose guide did divine Ulysses go,"
400,19,613,"Climb’d steep Parnassus, on whose forehead grow"
400,19,614,All sylvan offsprings round. And Soon they reach’d
400,19,615,"The concaves, whence air’s sounding vapours fetch’d"
400,19,616,Their loud descent. As soon as any sun
400,19,617,"Had from the ocean, where his waters run"
400,19,618,"In silent deepness, rais’d his golden head,"
400,19,619,"The early huntsmen all the hill had spread,"
400,19,620,"Their hounds before them on the searching trail,"
400,19,621,"They near, and ever eager to assail:"
400,19,622,"Ulysses brandishing a lengthful lance,"
400,19,623,Of whose first flight he long’d to prove the chance.
400,19,624,"Then found they lodg’d a boar of bulk extreme,"
400,19,625,In such a queach as never any beam
400,19,626,"The sun shot pierc’d, nor any pass let find"
400,19,627,"The moist impressions of the fiercest wind,"
400,19,628,"Nor any storm the sternest winter drives,"
400,19,629,Such proof it was; yet all within lay leaves
400,19,630,In mighty thickness; and through all this flew
400,19,631,"The hounds’ loud mouths. The sounds the tumult threw,"
400,19,632,"And all together, rous’d the boar, that rush’d"
400,19,633,"Amongst their thickest, all his bristles push’d"
400,19,634,"From forth his rough neck, and with flaming eyes"
400,19,635,"Stood close, and dar’d all. On which horrid prise"
400,19,636,Ulysses first charg’d; whom above the knee
400,19,637,"The savage struck, and rac’d it crookedly"
400,19,638,"Along the skin, yet never reach’d the bone."
400,19,639,"Ulysses’ lance yet through him quite was thrown,"
400,19,640,"At his right shoulder ent’ring, at his left"
400,19,641,"The bright head passage to his keenness cleft,"
400,19,642,And show’d his point gilt with the gushing gore.
400,19,643,"Down in the dust fell the extended boar,"
400,19,644,And forth his life flew. To Ulysses round
400,19,645,"His uncle drew; who, woeful for his wound,"
400,19,646,"With all art bound it up, and with a charm"
400,19,647,"Stay’d straight the blood, went home, and, when the harm"
400,19,648,"Receiv’d full cure, with gifts, and all event"
400,19,649,Of joy and love to his lov’d home they sent
400,19,650,Their honour’d nephew; whose return his sire
400,19,651,"And rev’rend mother took with joys entire,"
400,19,652,"Enquir’d all passages, all which he gave"
400,19,653,"In good relation, nor of all would save"
400,19,654,His wound from utt’rance; by whose scar he came
400,19,655,To be discover’d by this aged dame.
400,19,656,"Which when she cleansing felt, and noted well,"
400,19,657,Down from her lap into the caldron fell
400,19,658,"His weighty foot, that made the brass resound,"
400,19,659,"Turn’d all aside, and on th’ embrewéd ground"
400,19,660,Spilt all the water. Joy and grief together
400,19,661,Her breast invaded; and of weeping weather
400,19,662,Her eyes stood full; her small voice stuck within
400,19,663,Her part expressive; till at length his chin
400,19,664,"She took and spake to him: “O son,” said she,"
400,19,665,"“Thou art Ulysses, nor canst other be;"
400,19,666,"Nor could I know thee yet, till all my king"
400,19,667,I had gone over with the warméd spring.”
400,19,668,Then look’d she for the Queen to tell her all;
400,19,669,"And yet knew nothing sure, though nought could fall"
400,19,670,"In compass of all thoughts to make her doubt,"
400,19,671,Minerva that distraction struck throughout
400,19,672,Her mind’s rapt forces that she might not tell.
400,19,673,"Ulysses, noting yet her aptness well,"
400,19,674,"With one hand took her chin, and made all show"
400,19,675,"Of favour to her, with the other drew"
400,19,676,"Her offer’d parting closer, ask’d her why"
400,19,677,"She, whose kind breast had nurs’d so tenderly"
400,19,678,"His infant life, would now his age destroy,"
400,19,679,Though twenty years had held him from the joy
400,19,680,"Of his lov’d country? But, since only she,"
400,19,681,"God putting her in mind, now knew ’twas he,"
400,19,682,"He charg’d her silence, and to let no ear"
400,19,683,"In all the court more know his being there,"
400,19,684,"Lest, if God gave into his wreakful hand"
400,19,685,"Th’ insulting Wooers’ lives, he did not stand"
400,19,686,"On any partial respect with her,"
400,19,687,"Because his nurse, and to the rest prefer"
400,19,688,"Her safety therefore, but, when they should feel"
400,19,689,"His punishing finger, give her equal steel."
400,19,690,"“What words,” said she, “fly your retentive pow’rs?"
400,19,691,You know you lock your counsels in your tow’rs
400,19,692,"In my firm bosom, and that I am far"
400,19,693,"From those loose frailties. Like an iron bar,"
400,19,694,"Or bolt of solid’st stone, I will contain;"
400,19,695,"And tell you this besides; that if you gain,"
400,19,696,"By God’s good aid, the Wooers’ lives in yours,"
400,19,697,What dames are here their shameless paramours;
400,19,698,"And have done most dishonour to your worth,"
400,19,699,My information well shall paint you forth.”
400,19,700,"“It shall not need,” said he, “myself will soon,"
400,19,701,"While thus I mask here, set on ev’ry one"
400,19,702,My sure observance of the worst and best.
400,19,703,"Be thou then silent, and leave God the rest.”"
400,19,704,"This said, the old dame for more water went,"
400,19,705,The rest was all upon the pavement spent
400,19,706,"By known Ulysses’ foot. More brought, and he"
400,19,707,"Supplied beside with sweetest ointments, she"
400,19,708,"His seat drew near the fire, to keep him warm,"
400,19,709,And with his piec’d rags hiding close his harm.
400,19,710,"The Queen came near, and said: “Yet, guest, afford"
400,19,711,"Your further patience, till but in a word"
400,19,712,I’ll tell my woes to you; for well I know
400,19,713,"That Rest’s sweet hour her soft foot orders now,"
400,19,714,"When all poor men, how much soever griev’d,"
400,19,715,Would gladly get their woe - watch’d pow’rs reliev’d.
400,19,716,But God hath giv’n my grief a heart so great
400,19,717,"It will not down with rest, and so I set"
400,19,718,My judgment up to make it my delight.
400,19,719,"All day I mourn, yet nothing let the right"
400,19,720,I owe my charge both in my work and maids;
400,19,721,And when the night brings rest to others’ aids
400,19,722,"I toss my bed; Distress, with twenty points,"
400,19,723,Slaught’ring the pow’rs that to my turning joints
400,19,724,Convey the vital heat. And as all night
400,19,725,"Pandareus’ daughter, poor Edone, sings,"
400,19,726,"Clad in the verdure of the yearly springs,"
400,19,727,"When she for Itylus, her lovéd son,"
400,19,728,By Zethus’ issue in his madness done
400,19,729,"To cruel death, pours out her hourly moan,"
400,19,730,And draws the ears to her of ev’ry one;
400,19,731,"So flows my moan that cuts in two my mind,"
400,19,732,"And here and there gives my discourse the wind,"
400,19,733,Uncertain whether I shall with my son
400,19,734,"Abide still here, the safe possession"
400,19,735,"And guard of all goods, rev’rence to the bed"
400,19,736,"Of my lov’d lord, and to my far - off spread"
400,19,737,"Fame with the people, putting still in use,"
400,19,738,Or follow any best Greek I can chuse
400,19,739,"To his fit house, with treasure infinite,"
400,19,740,Won to his nuptials. While the infant plight
400,19,741,"And want of judgment kept my son in guide,"
400,19,742,"He was not willing with my being a bride,"
400,19,743,"Nor with my parting from his court; but now,"
400,19,744,"Arriv’d at man’s state, he would have me vow"
400,19,745,"My love to some one of my Wooers here,"
400,19,746,And leave his court; offended that their cheer
400,19,747,Should so consume his free possessions.
400,19,748,"To settle then a choice in these my moans,"
400,19,749,Hear and expound a dream that did engrave
400,19,750,"My sleeping fancy: Twenty geese I have,"
400,19,751,"All which, me thought, mine eye saw tasting wheat"
400,19,752,"In water steep’d, and joy’d to see them eat;"
400,19,753,When straight a crook - beak’d eagle from a hill
400,19,754,"Stoop’d, and truss’d all their necks, and all did kill;"
400,19,755,"When, all left scatter’d on the pavement there,"
400,19,756,She took her wing up to the Gods’ fair sphere.
400,19,757,"I, ev’n amid my dream, did weep and mourn"
400,19,758,"To see the eagle, with so shrewd a turn,"
400,19,759,"Stoop my sad turrets; when, methought, there came"
400,19,760,"About my mournings many a Grecian dame,"
400,19,761,To cheer my sorrows; in whose most extreme
400,19,762,"The hawk came back, and on the prominent beam"
400,19,763,"That cross’d my chamber fell, and us’d to me"
400,19,764,"A human voice, that sounded horribly,"
400,19,765,"And said: ‘Be confident, Icarius’ seed,"
400,19,766,"This is no dream, but what shall chance indeed."
400,19,767,"The geese the Wooers are, the eagle, I,"
400,19,768,"Was heretofore a fowl, but now imply"
400,19,769,"Thy husband’s being, and am come to give"
400,19,770,"The Wooers’ death, that on my treasure live.’"
400,19,771,"With this sleep left me, and my waking way"
400,19,772,"I took, to try if any violent prey"
400,19,773,"Were made of those my fowls, which well enough"
400,19,774,"I, as before, found feeding at their trough"
400,19,775,"Their yoted wheat.” “O woman,” he replied,"
400,19,776,“Thy dream can no interpretation bide
400,19,777,"But what the eagle made, who was your lord,"
400,19,778,And said himself would sure effect afford
400,19,779,To what he told you; that confusion
400,19,780,"To all the Wooers should appear, and none"
400,19,781,Escape the fate and death he had decreed.”
400,19,782,"She answer’d him: “O guest, these dreams exceed"
400,19,783,The art of man t’ interpret; and appear
400,19,784,Without all choice or form; nor ever were
400,19,785,Perform’d to all at all parts. But there are
400,19,786,"To these light dreams, that like thin vapours fare,"
400,19,787,"Two two - leav’d gates, the one of ivory,"
400,19,788,"The other horn. Those dreams, that fantasy"
400,19,789,"Takes from the polish’d ivory port, delude"
400,19,790,"The dreamer ever, and no truth include;"
400,19,791,"Those, that the glitt’ring horn - gate lets abroad,"
400,19,792,Do evermore some certain truth abode.
400,19,793,But this my dream I hold of no such sort
400,19,794,"To fly from thence; yet, whichsoever port"
400,19,795,"It had access from, it did highly please"
400,19,796,My son and me. And this my thoughts profess:
400,19,797,That day that lights me from Ulysses’ court
400,19,798,Shall both my infamy and curse consort.
400,19,799,"I, therefore, purpose to propose them now,"
400,19,800,"In strong contention, Ulysses’ bow;"
400,19,801,"Which he that eas’ly draws, and from his draft"
400,19,802,"Shoots through twelve axes (as he did his shaft,"
400,19,803,"All set up in a row, and from them all"
400,19,804,His stand - far - off kept firm) my fortunes shall
400,19,805,"Dispose, and take me to his house from hence,"
400,19,806,"Where I was wed a maid, in confluence"
400,19,807,Of feast and riches; such a court here then
400,19,808,As I shall ever in my dreams retain.”
400,19,809,"“Do not,” said he, “defer the gameful prize,"
400,19,810,But set to task their importunities
400,19,811,With something else than nuptials; for your lord
400,19,812,Will to his court and kingdom be restor’d
400,19,813,"Before they thread those steels, or draw his bow.”"
400,19,814,"“O guest,” replied Penelope, “would you"
400,19,815,"Thus sit and please me with your speech, mine ears"
400,19,816,Would never let mine eyelids close their spheres!
400,19,817,"But none can live without the death of sleep,"
400,19,818,Th’ Immortals in our mortal memories keep
400,19,819,"Our ends and deaths by sleep, dividing so,"
400,19,820,"As by the fate and portion of our woe,"
400,19,821,"Our times spent here, to let us nightly try"
400,19,822,"That while we live, as much live as we die."
400,19,823,"In which use I will to my bed ascend,"
400,19,824,"Which I bedew with tears, and sigh past end"
400,19,825,"Through all my hours spent, since I lost my joy"
400,19,826,"For vile, lewd, never - to - be - naméd, Troy,"
400,19,827,"Yet there I’ll prove for sleep, which take you here,"
400,19,828,"Or on the earth, if that your custom were,"
400,19,829,"Or have a bed, dispos’d for warmer rest.”"
400,19,830,"Thus left she with her ladies her old guest,"
400,19,831,"Ascended her fair chamber, and her bed,"
400,19,832,Whose sight did ever duly make her shed
400,19,833,"Tears for her lord; which still her eyes did steep,"
400,19,834,Till Pallas shut them with delightsome sleep.
400,19,835,THE END OF THE NINETEENTH BOOK OF HOMER’S ODYSSEYS.
400,19,836,"[1] _Χοὶνικος ἅπτηται,_ they will needs turn this, _quadram_ (for"
400,19,837,"_modium) gustet._ Though the words bear no such signification, but"
400,19,838,"give a proverb then in use repetition, which was: _he shall not join"
400,19,839,"or make a spoke in the nave of my chariot, or chariot - wheel."
400,19,840,"Χοίνικον,_ or _χοίνικις,_ signifying _modiolus rotæ,_ and _ἅπτω,"
400,19,841,recto._
400,19,842,"[2] Intending with truth itself, not his show only."
400,19,843,[3] Autolycus gives his grandchild Ulysses his name: from whence the
400,19,844,"Odysseys is derived, _’Οδυσσεύς,_ derived of _ὀδύζομαι, ex ὀδύνη"
400,19,845,"factum;_ signifying _dolorem proprie corporis, nam ira ex dolore"
400,19,846,oritur._
400,20,1,THE ARGUMENT
400,20,2,"Ulysses, in the Wooers’ beds,"
400,20,3,Resolving first to kill the maids.
400,20,4,"That sentence giving off, his care"
400,20,5,For other objects doth prepare.
400,20,6,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,20,7,_ψ._
400,20,8,"Jove’s thunder chides,"
400,20,9,"But cheers the King,"
400,20,10,The Wooers’ prides
400,20,11,Discomfiting.
400,20,12,"Ulysses in the entry laid his head,"
400,20,13,"And under him an ox - hide newly - flay’d,"
400,20,14,Above him sheep - fells store; and over those
400,20,15,Eurynomé cast mantles. His repose
400,20,16,"Would bring no sleep yet, studying the ill"
400,20,17,He wish’d the Wooers; who came by him still
400,20,18,"With all their wenches, laughing, wantoning,"
400,20,19,"In mutual lightness; which his heart did sting,"
400,20,20,"Contending two ways, if, all patience fled,"
400,20,21,"He should rush up and strike those strumpets dead,"
400,20,22,"Or let that night be last, and take th’ extreme"
400,20,23,"Of those proud Wooers, that were so supreme"
400,20,24,In pleasure of their high - fed fantasies.
400,20,25,His heart did bark within him to surprise
400,20,26,"Their sports with spoils; no fell she - mastiff can,"
400,20,27,"Amongst her whelps, fly eag’rer on a man"
400,20,28,"She doth not know, yet scents him something near,"
400,20,29,"And fain would come to please her tooth, and tear,"
400,20,30,"Than his disdain, to see his roof so fil’d"
400,20,31,"With those foul fashions, grew within him wild"
400,20,32,"To be in blood of them. But, finding best"
400,20,33,"In his free judgment to let passion rest,"
400,20,34,"He chid his angry spirit, and beat his breast,"
400,20,35,"And said: “Forbear, my mind, and think on this:"
400,20,36,There hath been time when bitter agonies
400,20,37,Have tried thy patience. Call to mind the day
400,20,38,"In which the Cyclop, which pass’d manly sway"
400,20,39,"Of violent strength, devour’d thy friends; thou then"
400,20,40,"Stood’st firmly bold, till from that hellish den"
400,20,41,"Thy wisdom brought thee off, when nought but death"
400,20,42,Thy thoughts resolv’d on.” This discourse did breathe
400,20,43,"The fiery boundings of his heart, that still"
400,20,44,"Lay in that æsture, without end his ill"
400,20,45,Yet manly suff’ring. But from side to side
400,20,46,It made him toss apace. You have not tried
400,20,47,A fellow roasting of a pig before
400,20,48,"A hasty fire, his belly yielding store"
400,20,49,"Of fat and blood, turn faster, labour more"
400,20,50,"To have it roast, and would not have it burn,"
400,20,51,Than this and that way his unrest made turn
400,20,52,"His thoughts and body, would not quench the fire,"
400,20,53,And yet not have it heighten his desire
400,20,54,"Past his discretion, and the fit enough"
400,20,55,"Of haste and speed, that went to all the proof"
400,20,56,"His well - laid plots, and his exploits requir’d,"
400,20,57,"Since he, but one, to all their deaths aspir’d."
400,20,58,"In this contention Pallas stoop’d from heav’n,"
400,20,59,"Stood over him, and had her presence giv’n"
400,20,60,"A woman’s form, who sternly thus began:"
400,20,61,"“Why, thou most sour and wretched - fated man"
400,20,62,"Of all that breathe, yet liest thou thus awake?"
400,20,63,The house in which thy cares so toss and take
400,20,64,Thy quiet up is thine; thy wife is there;
400,20,65,"And such a son, as if thy wishes were"
400,20,66,To be suffic’d with one they could not mend.”
400,20,67,"“Goddess,” said he, “’tis true; but I contend"
400,20,68,"To right their wrongs, and, though I be but one,"
400,20,69,To lay unhelp’d and wreakful hand upon
400,20,70,"This whole resort of impudents, that here"
400,20,71,Their rude assemblies never will forbear.
400,20,72,"And yet a greater doubt employs my care,"
400,20,73,"That if their slaughters in my reaches are,"
400,20,74,"And I perform them, Jove and you not pleas’d,"
400,20,75,How shall I fly their friends? And would stand seis’d
400,20,76,Of counsel to resolve this care in me.”
400,20,77,"“Wretch,” she replied, “a friend of worse degree"
400,20,78,"Might win thy credence, that a mortal were, I"
400,20,79,"And us’d to second thee, though nothing near"
400,20,80,So pow’rful in performance nor in care;
400,20,81,"Yet I, a Goddess, that have still had share"
400,20,82,"In thy achievements, and thy person’s guard,"
400,20,83,"Must still be doubted by thy brain, so hard"
400,20,84,To credit anything above thy pow’r;
400,20,85,And that must come from heav’n; if ev’ry hour
400,20,86,"There be not personal appearance made,"
400,20,87,"And aid direct giv’n, that may sense invade."
400,20,88,"I’ll tell thee, therefore, clearly: If there were"
400,20,89,Of divers - languag’d men an army here
400,20,90,"Of fifty companies, all driving hence"
400,20,91,"Thy sheep and oxen, and with violence"
400,20,92,"Offer’d to charge us, and besiege us round,"
400,20,93,"Thou shouldst their prey reprise, and them confound."
400,20,94,Let sleep then seize thee. _To keep watch all night
400,20,95,"Consumes the spirits, and makes dull the sight.”_"
400,20,96,"Thus pour’d the Goddess sleep into his eyes,"
400,20,97,And reascended the Olympian skies.
400,20,98,When care - and - lineament - resolving sleep
400,20,99,"Had laid his temples in his golden steep,"
400,20,100,"His - wise - in - chaste - wit - worthy wife did rise,"
400,20,101,"First sitting up in her soft bed, her eyes"
400,20,102,"Open’d with tears, in care of her estate,"
400,20,103,Which now her friends resolv’d to terminate
400,20,104,"To more delays, and make her marry one."
400,20,105,"Her silent tears then ceas’d, her orison"
400,20,106,This Queen of women to Diana made:
400,20,107,"“Rev’rend Diana, let thy darts invade"
400,20,108,"My woeful bosom, and my life deprive,"
400,20,109,"Now at this instant, or soon after drive"
400,20,110,"My soul with tempests forth, and give it way"
400,20,111,"To those far - off dark vaults, where never day"
400,20,112,"Hath pow’r to shine, and let them cast it down"
400,20,113,Where refluent Oceanus doth crown
400,20,114,"His curléd head, where Pluto’s orchard is,"
400,20,115,And entrance to our after miseries.
400,20,116,As such stern whirlwinds ravish’d to that stream
400,20,117,"Pandareus’ daughters, when the Gods to them"
400,20,118,"Had reft their parents, and them left alone,"
400,20,119,"Poor orphan children, in their mansion;"
400,20,120,Whose desolate life did Love’s sweet Queen incline
400,20,121,To nurse with presséd milk and sweetest wine;
400,20,122,Whom Juno deck’d beyond all other dames
400,20,123,"With wisdom’s light, and beauty’s moving flames;"
400,20,124,Whom Phœbe goodliness of stature render’d;
400,20,125,And to whose fair hands wise Minerva tender’d
400,20,126,The loom and needle in their utmost skill;
400,20,127,And while Love’s Empress scal’d th’ Olympian hill
400,20,128,To beg of lightning - loving Jove (since he
400,20,129,"The means to all things knows, and doth decree"
400,20,130,"Fortunes, infortunes, to the mortal race)"
400,20,131,"For those poor virgins, the accomplish’d grace"
400,20,132,"Of sweetest nuptials, the fierce Harpies prey’d"
400,20,133,"On ev’ry good and miserable maid,"
400,20,134,And to the hateful Furies gave them all
400,20,135,"In horrid service; yet, may such fate fall"
400,20,136,"From steep Olympus on my loathéd head,"
400,20,137,"Or fair - chair’d Phœbe strike me instant dead,"
400,20,138,That I may undergo the gloomy shore
400,20,139,"To visit great Ulysses’ soul, before"
400,20,140,I soothe my idle blood and wed a worse.
400,20,141,"And yet, beneath how desperate a curse"
400,20,142,Do I live now! It is an ill that may
400,20,143,"Be well endur’d, to mourn the whole long day,"
400,20,144,"So night’s sweet sleeps, that make a man forget"
400,20,145,"Both bad and good, in some degree would let"
400,20,146,"My thoughts leave grieving; but, both day and night,"
400,20,147,Some cruel God gives my sad memory sight.
400,20,148,"This night, methought, Ulysses grac’d my bed"
400,20,149,In all the goodly state with which he led
400,20,150,The Grecian army; which gave joys extreme
400,20,151,"To my distress, esteeming it no dream,"
400,20,152,"But true indeed; and that conceit I had,"
400,20,153,That when I saw it false I might be mad.
400,20,154,Such cruel fates command in my life’s guide.”
400,20,155,By this the morning’s orient dews had dyed
400,20,156,"The earth in all her colours; when the King,"
400,20,157,"In his sweet sleep, suppos’d the sorrowing"
400,20,158,That she us’d waking in her plaintive bed
400,20,159,"To be her mourning, standing by his head,"
400,20,160,"As having known him there; who straight arose,"
400,20,161,And did again within the hall dispose
400,20,162,"The carpets and the cushions, where before"
400,20,163,They serv’d the seats. The hide without the door
400,20,164,"He carried back, and then, with held - up hands,"
400,20,165,He pray’d to Him that heav’n and earth commands:
400,20,166,"“O Father Jove, if through the moist and dry"
400,20,167,"You, willing, brought me home, when misery"
400,20,168,"Had punish’d me enough by your free dooms,"
400,20,169,"Let some of these within those inner rooms,"
400,20,170,"Startled with horror of some strange ostent,"
400,20,171,"Come here, and tell me that great Jove hath bent"
400,20,172,Threat’nings without at some lewd men within.”
400,20,173,"To this his pray’r Jove shook his sable chin,"
400,20,174,"And thunder’d from those pure clouds that, above"
400,20,175,"The breathing air, in bright Olympus move."
400,20,176,Divine Ulysses joy’d to hear it roar.
400,20,177,Report of which a woman - miller bore
400,20,178,Straight to his ears; for near to him there ground
400,20,179,"Mills for his corn, that twice six women found"
400,20,180,"Continual motion, grinding barley - meal,"
400,20,181,"And wheat, man’s marrow. Sleep the eyes did seal"
400,20,182,"Of all the other women, having done"
400,20,183,Their usual task; which yet this dame alone
400,20,184,"Had scarce giv’n end to, being, of all the rest,"
400,20,185,Least fit for labour. But when these sounds prest
400,20,186,"Her ears, above the rumbling of her mill,"
400,20,187,"She let that stand, look’d out, and heav’n’s steep hill"
400,20,188,Saw clear and temp’rate; which made her (unware
400,20,189,Of giving any comfort to his care
400,20,190,"In that strange sign he pray’d for) thus, invoke:"
400,20,191,"“O King of men and Gods, a mighty stroke"
400,20,192,"Thy thund’ring hand laid on the cope of stars,"
400,20,193,No cloud in all the air; and therefore wars
400,20,194,Thou bidst to some men in thy sure ostent!
400,20,195,"Perform to me, poor wretch, the main event,"
400,20,196,"And make this day the last, and most extreme,"
400,20,197,In which the Wooers’ pride shall solace them
400,20,198,"With whorish banquets in Ulysses’ roof,"
400,20,199,"That, with sad toil to grind them meal enough,"
400,20,200,"Have quite dissolv’d my knees. Vouchsafe, then, now"
400,20,201,Thy thunders may their latest feast foreshow.”
400,20,202,"This was the boon Ulysses begg’d of Jove,[1]"
400,20,203,"Which, with his thunder, through his bosom drove"
400,20,204,"A joy, that this vaunt breath’d: “Why now these men,"
400,20,205,"Despite their pride, will Jove make pay me pain.”"
400,20,206,"By this had other maids, than those that lay"
400,20,207,"Mix’d with the Wooers, made a fire like day"
400,20,208,Amidst the hearth of the illustrious hall;
400,20,209,"And then the Prince, like a Celestial,"
400,20,210,"Rose from his bed, to his embalm’d feet tied"
400,20,211,"Fair shoes, his sword about his breast applied,"
400,20,212,"Took to his hand his sharp - pil’d lance, and met,"
400,20,213,"Amidst the entry, his old nurse, that set"
400,20,214,His haste at sudden stand; to whom he said:
400,20,215,"“O, my lov’d nurse, with what grace have you laid"
400,20,216,And fed my guest here? Could you so neglect
400,20,217,"His age, to lodge him thus? Though all respect"
400,20,218,"I give my mother’s wisdom, I must yet"
400,20,219,Affirm it fail’d in this; for she hath set
400,20,220,"At much more price a man of much less worth,"
400,20,221,"Without his person’s note, and yet casts forth"
400,20,222,"With ignominious hands, for his form sake,"
400,20,223,"A man much better.” “Do not faulty make,"
400,20,224,"Good son, the faultless. He was giv’n his seat"
400,20,225,"Close to her side, and food till he would eat,"
400,20,226,Wine till his wish was serv’d; for she requir’d
400,20,227,"His wants, and will’d him all things he desir’d;"
400,20,228,"Commanded her chief maids to make his bed,"
400,20,229,"But he, as one whom sorrow only fed"
400,20,230,"And all infortune, would not take his rest"
400,20,231,"In bed, and cov’rings fit for any guest,"
400,20,232,"But in the entry, on an ox’s hide"
400,20,233,"Never at tanner’s, his old limbs implied,"
400,20,234,In warm sheep - fells; yet over all we cast
400,20,235,"A mantle, fitting for a man more grac’d.”"
400,20,236,"He took her answer, left the house, and went,"
400,20,237,"Attended with his dogs, to sift th’ event"
400,20,238,"Of private plots, betwixt him and his sire"
400,20,239,In common counsel. Then the crew entire
400,20,240,Of all the household maids Euryclea bad
400,20,241,"Bestir them through the house, and see it clad"
400,20,242,In all best form; gave all their parts; and one
400,20,243,She set to furnish ev’ry seat and throne
400,20,244,"With needle works, and purple clothes of state;"
400,20,245,Another set to scour and cleanse the plate;
400,20,246,Another all the tables to make proud
400,20,247,With porous sponges; others she bestow’d
400,20,248,"In all speed to the spring, to fetch from thence"
400,20,249,Fit store of water; all at all expence
400,20,250,Of pains she will’d to be; for this to all
400,20,251,"Should be a day of common festival,"
400,20,252,"And not a Wooer now should seek his home,"
400,20,253,"Elsewhere than there, but all were bid to come"
400,20,254,"Exceeding early, and be rais’d to heav’n"
400,20,255,With all the entertainment could be giv’n.
400,20,256,"They heard with greedy ears, and ev’rything"
400,20,257,Put straight in practice. Twenty to the spring
400,20,258,Made speed for water; many in the house
400,20,259,Took pains; and all were both laborious
400,20,260,And skill’d in labour; many fell to fell
400,20,261,And cleave their wood; and all did more than well.
400,20,262,Then troop’d the lusty Wooers in; and then
400,20,263,Came all from spring; at their heels loaded men
400,20,264,"With slaughter’d brawns, of all the herd the prize,"
400,20,265,That had been long fed - up in sev’ral styes;
400,20,266,"Eumæus and his men convey’d them there,"
400,20,267,"He, seeing now the king, began to cheer,"
400,20,268,"And thus saluted him: “How now, my guest?"
400,20,269,Have yet your virtues found more interest
400,20,270,In these great Wooers’ good respects? Or still
400,20,271,Pursue they you with all their wonted ill?”
400,20,272,"“I would to heav’n, Eumæus,” he replied,"
400,20,273,"“The Deities once would take in hand their pride,"
400,20,274,That such unseemly fashions put in frame
400,20,275,"In others’ roofs, as show no spark of shame.”"
400,20,276,"Thus these; and to these came Melanthius,"
400,20,277,Great guardian of the most egregious
400,20,278,"Rich Wooers’ herds, consisting all of goats;"
400,20,279,"Which he, with two more, drave, and made their cotes"
400,20,280,The sounding porticos of that fair court.
400,20,281,"Melanthius, seeing the king, this former sort"
400,20,282,"Of upland language gave: “What? Still stay here,"
400,20,283,And dull these Wooers with thy wretched cheer?
400,20,284,Not gone for ever yet? Why now I see
400,20,285,"This strife of cuffs betwixt the beggary,"
400,20,286,"That yesterday assay’d to get thee gone,"
400,20,287,"And thy more roguery, needs will fall upon"
400,20,288,My hands to arbitrate. Thou wilt not hence
400,20,289,Till I set on thee; thy ragg’d impudence
400,20,290,Is so fast - footed. Are there not beside
400,20,291,"Other great banquetants, but you must tide"
400,20,292,"At anchor still with us?” He nothing said,"
400,20,293,"But thought of ill enough, and shook his head."
400,20,294,"Then came Philœtius, a chief of men,"
400,20,295,That to the Wooers’ all - devouring den
400,20,296,"A barren steer drave, and fat goats; for they"
400,20,297,"In custom were with traffickers by sea,"
400,20,298,"That who they would sent, and had utt’rance there."
400,20,299,And for these likewise the fair porches were
400,20,300,"Hurdles and sheep - pens, as in any fair."
400,20,301,Philœtius took note in his repair
400,20,302,"Of seen Ulysses, being a man as well"
400,20,303,"Giv’n to his mind’s use as to buy and sell,"
400,20,304,"Or do the drudg’ry that the blood desir’d,"
400,20,305,"And, standing near Eumæus, this enquir’d:"
400,20,306,“What guest is this that makes our house of late
400,20,307,His entertainer? Whence claims he the state
400,20,308,His birth in this life holds? What nation?
400,20,309,What race? What country stands his speech upon?
400,20,310,O’er hardly portion’d by the terrible Fates.
400,20,311,The structure of his lineaments relates
400,20,312,A king’s resemblance in his pomp of reign
400,20,313,"Ev’n thus in these rags. But poor erring men,"
400,20,314,"That have no firm home, but range here and there"
400,20,315,"As need compels, God keeps in this earth’s sphere,"
400,20,316,"As under water, and this tune he sings,"
400,20,317,When he is spinning ev’n the cares of kings.”
400,20,318,"Thus coming to him, with a kind of fear"
400,20,319,"He took his hand, and, touch’d exceeding near"
400,20,320,"With mere imagination of his worth,"
400,20,321,This salutation he sent loudly forth:
400,20,322,“Health! Father stranger! In another world
400,20,323,"Be rich and happy, though thou here art hurl’d"
400,20,324,At feet of never such insulting Need.
400,20,325,"O Jove, there lives no one God of thy seed"
400,20,326,More ill to man than thou. Thou tak’st no ruth —
400,20,327,When thou thyself hast got him in most truth —
400,20,328,"To wrap him in the straits of most distress,"
400,20,329,And in the curse of others’ wickedness.
400,20,330,"My brows have swet to see it, and mine eyes"
400,20,331,"Broke all in tears, when this being still the guise"
400,20,332,"Of worthiest men, I have but only thought,"
400,20,333,"That down to these ills was Ulysses wrought,"
400,20,334,"And that, thus clad, ev’n he is error - driv’n,"
400,20,335,If yet he live and sees the light of heav’n.
400,20,336,"But, if now dead, and in the house of hell,"
400,20,337,O me! O good Ulysses! That my weal
400,20,338,"Did ever wish, and when, but half a man"
400,20,339,"Amongst the people Cephallenian,"
400,20,340,His bounty to his oxen’s charge preferr’d
400,20,341,One in that youth; which now is grown a herd
400,20,342,"Unspeakable for number, and feed there"
400,20,343,"With their broad heads, as thick as of his ear"
400,20,344,A field of corn is to a man. Yet these
400,20,345,Some men advise me with this noted prease
400,20,346,"Of Wooers may devour, and wish me drive"
400,20,347,"Up to their feasts with them, that neither give"
400,20,348,"His son respect, though in his own free roof,"
400,20,349,Nor have the wit to fear th’ infallible proof
400,20,350,"Of Heav’nly vengeance, but make offer now"
400,20,351,The long - lack’d King’s possessions to bestow
400,20,352,In their self - shares. Methinks the mind in me
400,20,353,"Doth turn as fast, as in a flood or sea"
400,20,354,"A raging whirlpit doth, to gather in"
400,20,355,To fishy death those swimmers in their sin;
400,20,356,Or feeds a motion as circular
400,20,357,To drive my herds away. But while the son
400,20,358,"Bears up with life, ’twere heinous wrong to run"
400,20,359,"To other people with them, and to trust"
400,20,360,Men of another earth. And yet more just
400,20,361,"It were to venture their laws, the main right"
400,20,362,"Made still their masters, than at home lose quite"
400,20,363,"Their right and them, and sit and grieve to see"
400,20,364,The wrong authoriz’d by their gluttony.
400,20,365,"And I had long since fled, and tried th’ event"
400,20,366,"With other proud kings, since more insolent"
400,20,367,"These are than can be borne, but that ev’n still"
400,20,368,"I had a hope that this, though born to ill,"
400,20,369,"Would one day come from some coast, and their last"
400,20,370,In his roofs strew with ruins red and vast.”
400,20,371,"“Herdsman,” said he, “because thou art in show"
400,20,372,"Nor lewd nor indiscreet, and that I know"
400,20,373,"There rules in thee an understanding soul,"
400,20,374,"I’ll take an oath, that in thee shall control"
400,20,375,"All doubt of what I swear: Be witness, Jove,"
400,20,376,"That sway’st the first seat of the thron’d above,"
400,20,377,"This hospitable table, and this house,"
400,20,378,That still hold title for the strenuous
400,20,379,"Son of Laertes, that, if so you please,"
400,20,380,Your eyes shall witness Laertiades
400,20,381,"Arriv’d at home, and all these men that reign"
400,20,382,In such excesses here shall here lie slain!”
400,20,383,He answer’d: “Stranger! Would just Jove would sign
400,20,384,What you have sworn! In your eyes’ beams should shine
400,20,385,"What pow’rs I manage, and how these my hands"
400,20,386,Would rise and follow where he first commands.”
400,20,387,"So said Eumæus, praying all the Sky"
400,20,388,That wise Ulysses might arrive and try.
400,20,389,"Thus while they vow’d, the Wooers sat as hard"
400,20,390,"On his son’s death, but had their counsels scar’d,"
400,20,391,"For on their left hand did an eagle soar,"
400,20,392,And in her seres a fearful pigeon bore.
400,20,393,"Which seen, Amphinomus presag’d: “O friends,"
400,20,394,Our counsels never will receive their ends
400,20,395,In this man’s slaughter. Let us therefore ply
400,20,396,"Our bloody feast, and make his oxen die.”"
400,20,397,"Thus came they in, cast off on seats their cloaks,"
400,20,398,And fell to giving sacrificing strokes
400,20,399,"Of sheep and goats, the chiefly fat and great,"
400,20,400,"Slew fed - up swine, and from the herd a neat."
400,20,401,The inwards roasted they dispos’d bewixt
400,20,402,"Their then observers, wine in flagons mixt."
400,20,403,"The bowls Eumæus brought, Philœtius bread,"
400,20,404,Melanthius fill’d the wine. Thus drank and fed
400,20,405,"The feastful Wooers. Then the prince, in grace"
400,20,406,"Of his close project, did his father place"
400,20,407,"Amidst the pavéd entry, in a seat"
400,20,408,"Seemless and abject, a small board and meat"
400,20,409,Of th’ only inwards; in a cup of gold
400,20,410,"Yet sent him wine, and bade him now drink bold,"
400,20,411,All his approaches he himself would free
400,20,412,"’Gainst all the Wooers, since he would not see"
400,20,413,"His court made popular, but that his sire"
400,20,414,Built it to his use. Therefore all the fire
400,20,415,"Blown in the Wooers’ spleens he bade suppress,"
400,20,416,And that in hands nor words they should digress
400,20,417,From that set peace his speech did then proclaim.
400,20,418,They bit their lips and wonder’d at his aim
400,20,419,In that brave language; when Antinous said:
400,20,420,"“Though this speech, Grecians, be a mere upbraid,"
400,20,421,Yet this time give it pass. The will of Jove
400,20,422,"Forbids the violence of our hands to move,"
400,20,423,"But of our tongues we keep the motion free,"
400,20,424,"And, therefore, if his further jollity"
400,20,425,"Tempt our encounter with his braves, let’s check"
400,20,426,"His growing insolence, though pride to speak"
400,20,427,Fly passing high with him.” The wise prince made
400,20,428,"No more spring of his speech, but let it fade."
400,20,429,And now the heralds bore about the town
400,20,430,The sacred hecatomb; to whose renown
400,20,431,"The fair - hair’d Greeks assembled, and beneath"
400,20,432,Apollo’s shady wood the holy death
400,20,433,"They put to fire; which, made enough, they drew,"
400,20,434,"Divided all, that did in th’ end accrue"
400,20,435,To glorious satisfaction. Those that were
400,20,436,Disposers of the feast did equal cheer
400,20,437,"Bestow on wretched Laertiades,"
400,20,438,With all the Wooers’ souls; it so did please
400,20,439,Telemachus to charge them. And for these
400,20,440,Minerva would not see the malices
400,20,441,"The Wooers bore too much contain’d, that so"
400,20,442,Ulysses’ mov’d heart yet might higher flow
400,20,443,"In wreakful anguish. There was wooing there,"
400,20,444,"Amongst the rest, a gallant that did bear"
400,20,445,"The name of one well - learn’d in jests profane,"
400,20,446,"His name Ctesippus, born a Samian;"
400,20,447,"Who, proud because his father was so rich,"
400,20,448,Had so much confidence as did bewitch
400,20,449,His heart with hope to wed Ulysses’ wife;
400,20,450,"And this man said: “Hear me, my lords, in strife"
400,20,451,For this great widow. This her guest did share
400,20,452,"Even feast with us, with very comely care"
400,20,453,Of him that order’d it; for ’tis not good
400,20,454,"Nor equal to deprive guests of their food,"
400,20,455,And specially whatever guest makes way
400,20,456,To that house where Telemachus doth sway;
400,20,457,And therefore I will add to his receit
400,20,458,"A gift of very hospitable weight,"
400,20,459,Which he may give again to any maid
400,20,460,"That bathes his grave feet, and her pains see paid,"
400,20,461,Or any servant else that the divine
400,20,462,Ulysses’ lofty battlements confine.”
400,20,463,"Thus snatch’d he with a valiant hand, from out"
400,20,464,"The poor folks’ common basket, a neat’s foot,"
400,20,465,And threw it at Ulysses; who his head
400,20,466,"Shrunk quietly aside, and let it shed"
400,20,467,His malice on the wall; the suff’ring man
400,20,468,"A laughter raising most Sardinian,"
400,20,469,"With scorn and wrath mix’d, at the Samian."
400,20,470,Whom thus the prince reprov’d: “Your valour wan
400,20,471,"Much grace, Ctesippus, and hath eas’d your mind"
400,20,472,"With mighty profit, yet you see it find"
400,20,473,No mark it aim’d at; the poor stranger’s part
400,20,474,"Himself made good enough, to ’scape your dart."
400,20,475,"But should I serve thee worthily, my lance"
400,20,476,"Should strike thy heart through, and, in place t’ advance"
400,20,477,"Thyself in nuptials with his wealth, thy sire"
400,20,478,Should make thy tomb here; that the foolish fire
400,20,479,Of all such valours may not dare to show
400,20,480,These foul indecencies to me. I now
400,20,481,"Have years to understand my strength, and know"
400,20,482,"The good and bad of things, and am no more"
400,20,483,"At your large suff’rance, to behold my store"
400,20,484,"Consum’d with patience, see my cattle slain,"
400,20,485,"My wine exhausted, and my bread in vain"
400,20,486,Spent on your license; for to one then young
400,20,487,So many enemies were match too strong.
400,20,488,But let me never more be witness to
400,20,489,"Your hostile minds, nor those base deeds ye do;"
400,20,490,"For, should ye kill me in my offer’d wreak,"
400,20,491,"I wish it rather, and my death would speak"
400,20,492,"Much more good of me, than to live and see"
400,20,493,"Indignity upon indignity,"
400,20,494,"My guests provok’d with bitter words and blows,"
400,20,495,My women - servants dragg’d about my house
400,20,496,To lust and rapture.” This made silence seize
400,20,497,The house throughout; till Damastorides
400,20,498,"At length the calm brake, and said: “Friend, forbear"
400,20,499,To give a just speech a disdainful ear;
400,20,500,"The guest no more touch, nor no servant here."
400,20,501,Myself will to the Prince and Queen commend
400,20,502,"A motion grateful, if they please to lend"
400,20,503,Grateful receipt. As long as any hope
400,20,504,Left wise Ulysses any passage ope
400,20,505,"To his return in our conceits, so long"
400,20,506,The Queen’s delays to our demands stood strong
400,20,507,"In cause and reason, and our quarrels thus"
400,20,508,"With guests, the Queen, or her Telemachus,"
400,20,509,Set never foot amongst our lib’ral feast;
400,20,510,"For should the King return, though thought deceas’d,"
400,20,511,"It had been gain to us, in finding him,"
400,20,512,"To lose his wife. But now, since nothing dim"
400,20,513,The days break out that show he never more
400,20,514,"Shall reach the dear touch of his country - shore,"
400,20,515,"Sit by your mother, in persuasion"
400,20,516,That now it stands her honour much upon
400,20,517,"To choose the best of us, and, who gives most,"
400,20,518,"To go with him home. For so, all things lost"
400,20,519,"In sticking on our haunt so, you shall clear"
400,20,520,"Recover in our no more concourse here,"
400,20,521,"Possess your birth - right wholly, eat and drink,"
400,20,522,And never more on our disgraces think.”
400,20,523,"“By Jove, no, Agelaus! For I swear"
400,20,524,"By all my father’s sorrows, who doth err"
400,20,525,"Far off from Ithaca, or rests in death,"
400,20,526,I am so far from spending but my breath
400,20,527,To make my mother any more defer
400,20,528,"Her wishéd nuptials, that I’ll counsel her"
400,20,529,To make her free choice; and besides will give
400,20,530,Large gifts to move her. But I fear to drive
400,20,531,Or charge her hence; for God will not give way
400,20,532,"To any such course, if I should assay.”"
400,20,533,"At this, Minerva made for foolish joy"
400,20,534,"The Wooers mad, and rous’d their late annoy"
400,20,535,To such a laughter as would never down.
400,20,536,"They laugh’d with others’ cheeks, ate meat o’erflown"
400,20,537,"With their own bloods, their eyes stood full of tears"
400,20,538,"For violent joys; their souls yet thought of fears,"
400,20,539,"Which Theoclymenus express’d, and said:"
400,20,540,"“O wretches! Why sustain ye, well apaid,"
400,20,541,"Your imminent ill? A night, with which death sees,"
400,20,542,Your heads and faces hides beneath your knees;
400,20,543,Shrieks burn about you; your eyes thrust out tears;
400,20,544,"These fixéd walls, and that main beam that bears"
400,20,545,"The whole house up, in bloody torrents fall;"
400,20,546,The entry full of ghosts stands; full the hall
400,20,547,Of passengers to hell; and under all
400,20,548,The dismal shades; the sun sinks from the poles;
400,20,549,And troubled air pours bane about your souls.”
400,20,550,They sweetly laughed at this. Eurymachus
400,20,551,"To mocks dispos’d, and said: “This new - come - t’ - us"
400,20,552,"Is surely mad, conduct him forth to light"
400,20,553,In th’ open market - place; he thinks ’tis night
400,20,554,"Within the house.” “Eurymachus,” said he,"
400,20,555,"“I will not ask for any guide of thee,"
400,20,556,"I both my feet enjoy, have ears and eyes,"
400,20,557,And no mad soul within me; and with these
400,20,558,"Will I go forth the doors, because I know"
400,20,559,"That imminent mischief must abide with you,"
400,20,560,Which not a man of all the Wooers here
400,20,561,Shall fly or ’scape. Ye all too highly bear
400,20,562,"Your uncurb’d heads. Impieties ye commit,"
400,20,563,And ev’ry man affect with forms unfit.”
400,20,564,"This said, he left the house, and took his way"
400,20,565,"Home to Piræus; who, as free as day,"
400,20,566,Was of his welcome. When the Wooers’ eyes
400,20,567,"Chang’d looks with one another, and, their guise"
400,20,568,"Of laughters still held on, still eas’d their breasts"
400,20,569,"Of will to set the Prince against his guests,"
400,20,570,Affirming that of all the men alive
400,20,571,"He worst luck had, and prov’d it worst to give"
400,20,572,Guests entertainment; for he had one there
400,20,573,"A wand’ring hunter - out of provender,"
400,20,574,"An errant beggar ev’ry way, yet thought"
400,20,575,(He was so hungry) that he needed nought
400,20,576,"But wine and victuals, nor knew how to do,"
400,20,577,"Nor had a spirit to put a knowledge to,"
400,20,578,But liv’d an idle burthen to the earth.
400,20,579,"Another then stepp’d up, and would lay forth"
400,20,580,"His lips in prophecy, thus: “But, would he hear"
400,20,581,"His friends’ persuasions, he should find it were"
400,20,582,More profit for him to put both aboard
400,20,583,"For the Sicilian people, that afford"
400,20,584,These feet of men good price; and this would bring[2]
400,20,585,"Good means for better guests.” These, words made wing"
400,20,586,"To his ears idly, who had still his eye"
400,20,587,"Upon his father, looking fervently"
400,20,588,When he would lay his long - withholding hand
400,20,589,"On those proud Wooers. And, within command"
400,20,590,"Of all this speech that pass’d, Icarius’ heir,"
400,20,591,"The wise Penelope, her royal chair"
400,20,592,Had plac’d of purpose. Their high dinner then
400,20,593,With all - pleas’d palates these ridiculous men
400,20,594,"Fell sweetly to, as joying they had slain"
400,20,595,Such store of banquet. But there did not reign
400,20,596,A bitterer banquet - planet in all heav’n
400,20,597,"Than that which Pallas had to that day driv’n,"
400,20,598,"And, with her able friend now, meant t’ appose,"
400,20,599,Since they till then were in deserts so gross.

400,20,604,THE TWENTY - FIRST BOOK OF HOMER’S ODYSSEYS
400,20,605,THE ARGUMENT
400,20,606,Penelope proposeth now
400,20,607,To him that draws Ulysses’ bow
400,20,608,Her instant nuptials. Ithacus
400,20,609,Eumæus and Philœtius
400,20,610,Gives charge for guarding of the gates;
400,20,611,And he his shaft shoots through the plates.
400,20,612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,20,613,_Φι̑._
400,20,614,The nuptial vow
400,20,615,"And game rehears’d,"
400,20,616,"Drawn is the bow,"
400,20,617,The steels are pierc’d.
400,20,618,"Pallus, the Goddess with the sparkling eyes,"
400,20,619,"Excites Penelope t’ object the prize,"
400,20,620,"The bow and bright steels, to the Wooers’ strength"
400,20,621,And here began the strife and blood at length.
400,20,622,She first ascended by a lofty stair
400,20,623,Her utmost chamber; of whose door her fair
400,20,624,"And half transparent hand receiv’d the key,"
400,20,625,"Bright, brazen, bitted passing curiously,"
400,20,626,And at it hung a knob of ivory.
400,20,627,And this did lead her where was strongly kept
400,20,628,The treasure - royal; in whose store lay heapt
400,20,629,"Gold, brass, and steel, engrav’n with infinite art;"
400,20,630,"The crooked bow, and arrowy quiver, part"
400,20,631,Of that rich magazine. In the quiver were
400,20,632,"Arrows a number, sharp and sighing gear."
400,20,633,The bow was giv’n by kind Eurytides
400,20,634,"Iphitus, fashion’d like the Deities,"
400,20,635,"To young Ulysses, when within the roof"
400,20,636,Of wise Orsilochus their pass had proof
400,20,637,Of mutual meeting in Messena; where
400,20,638,"Ulysses claim’d a debt, to whose pay were"
400,20,639,"The whole Messenian people bound, since they"
400,20,640,From Ithaca had forc’d a wealthy prey
400,20,641,Of sheep and shepherds. In their ships they thrust
400,20,642,Three hundred sheep together; for whose just
400,20,643,And instant rendry old Laertes sent
400,20,644,"Ulysses his ambassador, that went"
400,20,645,"A long way in the ambassy, yet then"
400,20,646,Bore but the foremost prime of youngest men;
400,20,647,His father sending first to that affair
400,20,648,"His gravest counsellors, and then his heir."
400,20,649,"Iphitus made his way there, having lost"
400,20,650,"Twelve female horse, and mules commended most"
400,20,651,For use of burthen; which were after cause
400,20,652,"Of death and fate to him; for, past all laws"
400,20,653,"Of hospitality, Jove’s mighty son,"
400,20,654,"Skill’d in great acts, was his confusion"
400,20,655,"Close by his house, though at that time his guest,"
400,20,656,"Respecting neither the apposéd feast,"
400,20,657,"And hospitable table, that in love"
400,20,658,"He set before him, nor the voice of Jove,"
400,20,659,"But, seizing first his mares, he after slew"
400,20,660,His host himself. From those mares’ search now grew
400,20,661,Ulysses known t’ Iphitus; who that bow
400,20,662,"At their encounter did in love bestow,"
400,20,663,"Which great Eurytus’ hand had borne before,"
400,20,664,"(Iphitus’ father) who, at death’s sad door,"
400,20,665,"In his steep turrets, left it to his son."
400,20,666,"Ulysses gave him a keen falchion,"
400,20,667,And mighty lance. And thus began they there
400,20,668,Their fatal loves; for after never were
400,20,669,"Their mutual tables to each other known,"
400,20,670,Because Jove’s son th’ unworthy part had shown
400,20,671,"Of slaughtering this God - like loving man,"
400,20,672,"Eurytus’ son, who with that bow began"
400,20,673,And ended love t’ Ulysses; who so dear
400,20,674,"A gift esteem’d it, that he would not bear"
400,20,675,"In his black fleet that guest - rite to the war,"
400,20,676,"But, in fit memory of one so far"
400,20,677,"In his affection, brought it home, and kept"
400,20,678,His treasure with it; where till now it slept.
400,20,679,And now the Queen of women had intent
400,20,680,"To give it use, and therefore made ascent"
400,20,681,"Up all the stairs’ height to the chamber door,"
400,20,682,Whose shining leaves two bright pilasters bore
400,20,683,To such a close when both together went
400,20,684,It would resist the air in their consent.
400,20,685,"The ring she took then, and did draw aside"
400,20,686,"A bar that ran within, and then implied"
400,20,687,"The key into the lock, which gave a sound,"
400,20,688,"The bolt then shooting, as in pasture ground"
400,20,689,"A bull doth low, and make the valleys ring;"
400,20,690,"So loud the lock humm’d when it loos’d the spring,"
400,20,691,"And ope the doors flew. In she went, along"
400,20,692,"The lofty chamber, that was boarded strong"
400,20,693,"With heart of oak, which many years ago"
400,20,694,The architect did smooth and polish so
400,20,695,"That now as then he made it freshly shine,"
400,20,696,And tried the evenness of it with a line.
400,20,697,There stood in this room presses that enclos’d
400,20,698,"Robes odoriferous, by which repos’d"
400,20,699,The bow was upon pins; nor from it far
400,20,700,Hung the round quiver glitt’ring like a star;
400,20,701,Both which her white extended hand took down.
400,20,702,"Then sat she low, and made her lap a crown"
400,20,703,"Of both these relics, which she wept to see,"
400,20,704,And cried quite out with loving memory
400,20,705,Of her dear lord; to whose worth paying then
400,20,706,"Kind debts enow, she left, and, to the men"
400,20,707,"Vow’d to her wooing, brought the crooked bow,"
400,20,708,"And shaft - receiving quiver, that did flow"
400,20,709,With arrows beating sighs up where they fell.
400,20,710,"Then, with another chest, replete as well"
400,20,711,"With games won by the King, of steel and brass,"
400,20,712,Her maids attended. Past whom making pass
400,20,713,"To where her Wooers were, she made her stay"
400,20,714,"Amidst the fair hall door, and kept the ray"
400,20,715,"Of her bright count’nance hid with veils so thin,"
400,20,716,"That though they seem’d t’ expose, they let love in;"
400,20,717,Her maids on both sides stood; and thus she spake:
400,20,718,"“Hear me, ye Wooers, that a pleasure take"
400,20,719,"To do me sorrow, and my house invade"
400,20,720,"To eat and drink, as if ’twere only made"
400,20,721,"To serve your rapines; my lord long away,"
400,20,722,And you allow’d no colour for your stay
400,20,723,But his still absence; striving who shall frame
400,20,724,"Me for his wife; and, since ’tis made a game,"
400,20,725,I here propose divine Ulysses’ bow
400,20,726,For that great master - piece to which ye vow.
400,20,727,"He that can draw it with least show to strive,"
400,20,728,"And through these twelve axe - heads an arrow drive,"
400,20,729,"Him will I follow, and this house forego"
400,20,730,"That nourish’d me a maid, now furnish’d so"
400,20,731,"With all things fit, and which I so esteem"
400,20,732,That I shall still live in it in my dream.”
400,20,733,"This said, she made Eumæus give it them."
400,20,734,"He took and laid it by, and wept for woe;"
400,20,735,"And like him wept Philœtius, when the bow"
400,20,736,Of which his king was bearer he beheld.
400,20,737,"Their tears Antinous’ manhood much refell’d,"
400,20,738,And said: “Ye rustic fools! that still each day
400,20,739,"Your minds give over to this vain dismay,"
400,20,740,"Why weep ye, wretches, and the widow’s eyes"
400,20,741,"Tempt with renew’d thought, that would otherwise"
400,20,742,"Depose her sorrows, since her lord is dead,"
400,20,743,"And tears are idle? Sit, and eat your bread,"
400,20,744,"Nor whisper more a word; or get ye gone,"
400,20,745,And weep without doors. Let this bow alone
400,20,746,To our out - match’d contention. For I fear
400,20,747,The bow will scarce yield draught to any here;
400,20,748,Here no such man lives as Laertes’ son
400,20,749,Amongst us all. I knew him; thought puts on
400,20,750,"His look’s sight now, methinks, though then a child.”"
400,20,751,"Thus show’d his words doubt, yet his hopes instill’d"
400,20,752,"His strength the stretcher of Ulysses’ string,"
400,20,753,And his steels’ piercer. But his shaft must sing
400,20,754,Through his pierc’d palate first; whom so he wrong’d
400,20,755,"In his free roof, and made the rest ill - tongued"
400,20,756,Against his virtues. Then the sacred heat
400,20,757,That spirited his son did further set
400,20,758,"Their confidence on fire, and said: “O friends,"
400,20,759,"Jove hath bereft my wits. The Queen intends,"
400,20,760,"Though I must grant her wise, ere long to leave"
400,20,761,"Ulysses’ court, and to her bed receive"
400,20,762,"Some other lord; yet, notwithstanding, I"
400,20,763,"Am forc’d to laugh, and set my pleasures high"
400,20,764,"Like one mad sick. But, Wooers, since ye have"
400,20,765,"An object for your trials now so brave,"
400,20,766,"As all the broad Achaian earth exceeds,"
400,20,767,"As sacred Pylos, as the Argive breeds,"
400,20,768,"As black Epirus, as Mycena’s birth,"
400,20,769,"And as the more fam’d Ithacensian earth,"
400,20,770,"All which, yourselves well know, and oft have said —"
400,20,771,For what need hath my mother of my aid
400,20,772,In her advancement? — tender no excuse
400,20,773,"For least delay, nor too much time profuse"
400,20,774,"In stay to draw this bow, but draw it straight,"
400,20,775,"Shoot, and the steels pierce; make all see how slight"
400,20,776,You make these poor bars to so rich a prize.
400,20,777,No eag’rer yet? Come all. My faculties
400,20,778,"Shall try the bow’s strength, and the piercéd steel."
400,20,779,I will not for my rev’rend mother feel
400,20,780,"The sorrows that I know will seize my heart,"
400,20,781,"To see her follow any, and depart"
400,20,782,From her so long - held home; but first extend
400,20,783,The bow and arrow to their tender’d end.
400,20,784,For I am only to succeed my sire
400,20,785,"In guard of his games, and let none aspire"
400,20,786,"To their besides possession.” This said,"
400,20,787,His purple robe he cast off; by he laid
400,20,788,"His well - edg’d sword; and, first, a sev’ral pit"
400,20,789,"He digg’d for ev’ry axe, and strengthen’d it"
400,20,790,With earth close ramm’d about it; on a rew
400,20,791,"Set them, of one height, by a line he drew"
400,20,792,Along the whole twelve; and so orderly
400,20,793,Did ev’ry deed belonging (yet his eye
400,20,794,Never before beholding how ’twas done)
400,20,795,That in amaze rose all his lookers - on.
400,20,796,"Then stood he near the door, and prov’d to draw"
400,20,797,"The stubborn bow. Thrice tried, and thrice gave law"
400,20,798,To his uncrown’d attempts; the fourth assay
400,20,799,"With all force off’ring, which a sign gave stay"
400,20,800,Giv’n by his father; though he show’d a mind
400,20,801,As if he stood right heartily inclin’d
400,20,802,"To perfect the exploit, when all was done"
400,20,803,In only drift to set the Wooers on.
400,20,804,"His weakness yet confess’d, he said: “O shame!"
400,20,805,"I either shall be ever of no name,"
400,20,806,"But prove a wretch; or else I am too young,"
400,20,807,And must not now presume on pow’rs so strong
400,20,808,"As sinews yet more growing may engraft,"
400,20,809,To turn a man quite over with a shaft.
400,20,810,"Besides, to men whose nerves are best prepar’d,"
400,20,811,_All great adventures at first proof are hard._
400,20,812,"But come, you stronger men, attempt this bow,"
400,20,813,"And let us end our labour.” Thus, below"
400,20,814,"A well - join’d board he laid it, and close by"
400,20,815,The brightly - headed shaft; then thron’d his thigh
400,20,816,Amidst his late - left seat. Antinous then
400,20,817,"Bade all arise; but first, who did sustain"
400,20,818,"The cup’s state ever, and did sacrifice"
400,20,819,"Before they ate still, and that man bade rise,"
400,20,820,"Since on the other’s right hand he was plac’d,"
400,20,821,"Because he held the right hand’s rising, grac’d"
400,20,822,With best success still. This discretion won
400,20,823,"Supreme applause; and first rose Œnops’ son,"
400,20,824,"Liodes, that was priest to all the rest,"
400,20,825,"Sat lowest with the cup still, and their jest"
400,20,826,"Could never like, but ever was the man"
400,20,827,That check’d their follies; and he now began
400,20,828,"To taste the bow, the sharp shaft took, tugg’d hard,"
400,20,829,"And held aloft, and, till he quite had marr’d"
400,20,830,"His delicate tender fingers, could not stir"
400,20,831,The churlish string; who therefore did refer
400,20,832,"The game to others, saying, that same bow,"
400,20,833,"In his presage, would prove the overthrow"
400,20,834,Of many a chief man there; nor thought the fate
400,20,835,"Was any whit austere, since death’s short date"
400,20,836,"Were much the better taken, than long life"
400,20,837,"Without the object of their amorous strife,"
400,20,838,For whom they had burn’d - out so many days
400,20,839,"To find still other, nothing but delays"
400,20,840,Obtaining in them; and affirm’d that now
400,20,841,"Some hop’d to have her, but when that tough bow"
400,20,842,"They all had tried, and seen the utmost done,"
400,20,843,They must rest pleas’d to cease; and now some one
400,20,844,Of all their other fair - veil’d Grecian dames
400,20,845,"With gifts, and dower, and Hymeneal flames,"
400,20,846,"Let her love light to him that most will give,"
400,20,847,And whom the nuptial destiny did drive.”
400,20,848,Thus laid he on the well - join’d polish’d board
400,20,849,"The bow and bright - pil’d shaft, and then restor’d"
400,20,850,His seat his right. To him Antinous
400,20,851,"Gave bitter language, and reprov’d him thus:"
400,20,852,"“What words, Liodes, pass thy speech’s guard,"
400,20,853,"That ’tis a work to bear, and set so hard"
400,20,854,They set up my disdain! This bow must end
400,20,855,The best of us? Since thy arms cannot lend
400,20,856,The string least motion? Thy mother’s throes
400,20,857,"Brought never forth thy arms to draught of bows,"
400,20,858,Or knitting shafts off. Though thou canst not draw
400,20,859,"The sturdy plant, thou art to us no law."
400,20,860,"Melanthius! Light a fire, and set thereat"
400,20,861,"A chair and cushions, and that mass of fat"
400,20,862,"That lies within bring out, that we may set"
400,20,863,"Our pages to this bow, to see it het"
400,20,864,"And suppled with the suet, and then we"
400,20,865,"May give it draught, and pay this great decree"
400,20,866,Utmost performance.” He a mighty fire
400,20,867,"Gave instant flame, put into act th’ entire"
400,20,868,"Command laid on him, chair and cushions set,"
400,20,869,"Laid on the bow, which straight the pages het,"
400,20,870,"Chaf’d, suppled with the suet to their most;"
400,20,871,"And still was all their unctuous labour lost,"
400,20,872,All Wooers’ strengths too indigent and poor
400,20,873,"To draw that bow; Antinous’ arms it tore,"
400,20,874,"And great Eurymachus’, the both clear best,"
400,20,875,"Yet both it tir’d, and made them glad to rest."
400,20,876,"Forth then went both the swains, and after them"
400,20,877,"Divine Ulysses; when, being past th’ extreme"
400,20,878,"Of all the gates, with winning words he tried"
400,20,879,"Their loves, and this ask’d: “Shall my counsels hide"
400,20,880,Their depths from you? My mind would gladly know
400,20,881,If suddenly Ulysses had his vow
400,20,882,"Made good for home, and had some God to guide"
400,20,883,"His steps and strokes to wreak these Wooers’ pride,"
400,20,884,"Would your aids join on his part, or with theirs?"
400,20,885,How stand your hearts affected?” They made pray’rs
400,20,886,"That some God would please to return their lord,"
400,20,887,He then should see how far they would afford
400,20,888,"Their lives for his. He, seeing their truth, replied;"
400,20,889,"“I am your lord, through many a suff’rance tried,"
400,20,890,"Arriv’d now here, whom twenty years have held"
400,20,891,From forth my country. Yet are not conceal’d
400,20,892,From my sure knowledge your desires to see
400,20,893,My safe return. Of all the company
400,20,894,"Now serving here besides, not one but you"
400,20,895,Mine ear hath witness’d willing to bestow
400,20,896,"Their wishes of my life, so long held dead."
400,20,897,"I therefore vow, which shall be perfected,"
400,20,898,That if God please beneath my hand to leave
400,20,899,"These Wooers lifeless, ye shall both receive"
400,20,900,"Wives from that hand, and means, and near to me"
400,20,901,"Have houses built to you, and both shall be"
400,20,902,As friends and brothers to my only son.
400,20,903,"And, that ye well may know me, and be won"
400,20,904,"To that assurance, the infallible sign"
400,20,905,"The white - tooth’d boar gave, this mark’d knee of mine,"
400,20,906,When in Parnassus he was held in chase
400,20,907,"By me, and by my famous grandsire’s race,"
400,20,908,I’ll let you see.” Thus sever’d he his weed
400,20,909,From that his wound; and ev’ry word had deed
400,20,910,In their sure knowledges. Which made them cast
400,20,911,"Their arms about him, his broad breast embrac’d,"
400,20,912,His neck and shoulders kiss’d. And him as well
400,20,913,Did those true pow’rs of human love compell
400,20,914,"To kiss their heads and hands, and to their moan"
400,20,915,"Had sent the free light of the cheerful sun,"
400,20,916,"Had not Ulysses broke the ruth, and said;"
400,20,917,"“Cease tears and sorrows, lest we prove display’d"
400,20,918,"By some that issue from the house, and they"
400,20,919,"Relate to those within. Take each his way,"
400,20,920,"Not altogether in, but one by one,"
400,20,921,"First I, then you; and then see this be done;"
400,20,922,The envious Wooers will by no means give
400,20,923,The offer of the bow and arrow leave
400,20,924,"To come at me; spite then their pride, do thou,"
400,20,925,"My good Eumæus, bring both shaft and bow"
400,20,926,To my hand’s proof; and charge the maids before
400,20,927,"That instantly they shut in ev’ry door,"
400,20,928,That they themselves (if any tumult rise
400,20,929,Beneath my roofs by any that envies
400,20,930,My will to undertake the game) may gain
400,20,931,"No passage forth, but close at work contain"
400,20,932,"With all free quiet, or at least constrain’d,"
400,20,933,"And therefore, my Philœtius, see maintain’d,"
400,20,934,"When close the gates are shut, their closure fast,"
400,20,935,To which end be it thy sole work to cast
400,20,936,"Their chains before them.” This said, in he led,"
400,20,937,Took first his seat; and then they seconded
400,20,938,His entry with their own. Then took in hand
400,20,939,"Eurymachus the bow, made close his stand"
400,20,940,"Aside the fire, at whose heat here and there"
400,20,941,"He warm’d and suppled it, yet could not stere"
400,20,942,"To any draught the string, with all his art;"
400,20,943,"And therefore swell’d in him his glorious heart,"
400,20,944,"Affirming, “that himself and all his friends"
400,20,945,"Had cause to grieve, not only that their ends"
400,20,946,"They miss’d in marriage, since enough besides"
400,20,947,Kind Grecian dames there liv’d to be their brides
400,20,948,"In Ithaca, and other bord’ring towns,"
400,20,949,But that to all times future their renowns
400,20,950,"Would stand disparag’d, if Ulysses’ bow"
400,20,951,"They could not draw, and yet his wife would woo.”"
400,20,952,Antinous answer’d; “That there could ensue
400,20,953,No shame at all to them; for well he knew
400,20,954,That this day was kept holy to the Sun
400,20,955,"By all the city, and there should be done"
400,20,956,"No such profane act, therefore bade lay by"
400,20,957,The bow for that day; but the mastery
400,20,958,"Of axes that were set up still might stand,"
400,20,959,"Since that no labour was, nor any hand"
400,20,960,"Would offer to invade Ulysses’ house,"
400,20,961,"To take, or touch with surreptitious"
400,20,962,"Or violent hand, what there was left for use."
400,20,963,"He, therefore, bade the cup - bearer infuse"
400,20,964,"Wine to the bowls, that so with sacrifice"
400,20,965,"They might let rest the shooting exercise,"
400,20,966,And in the morning make Melanthius bring
400,20,967,"The chief goats of his herd, that to the King"
400,20,968,Of bows and archers they might burn the thighs
400,20,969,"For good success, and then attempt the prize.”"
400,20,970,The rest sat pleas’d with this. The heralds straight
400,20,971,Pour’d water on their hands; each page did wait
400,20,972,"With his crown’d cup of wine, serv’d ev’ry man"
400,20,973,Till all were satisfied. And then began
400,20,974,Ulysses’ plot of his close purpose thus:
400,20,975,"“Hear me, ye much renown’d Eurymachus,"
400,20,976,"And king Antinous, in chief, who well,"
400,20,977,"And with decorum sacred, doth compell"
400,20,978,"This day’s observance, and to let lay down"
400,20,979,"The bow all this light, giving Gods their own."
400,20,980,"The morning’s labour God the more will bless,"
400,20,981,And strength bestow where he himself shall please.
400,20,982,Against which time let me presume to pray
400,20,983,"Your favours with the rest, that this assay"
400,20,984,"May my old arms prove, trying if there lie"
400,20,985,In my poor pow’rs the same activity
400,20,986,That long since crown’d them; or if needy fare
400,20,987,And desolate wand’ring have the web worn bare
400,20,988,"Of my life’s thread at all parts, that no more"
400,20,989,Can furnish these affairs as heretofore.”
400,20,990,"This het their spleens past measure, blown with fear"
400,20,991,Lest his loath’d temples would the garland wear
400,20,992,Of that bow’s draught; Antinous using speech
400,20,993,To this sour purpose: “Thou most arrant wretch
400,20,994,"Of all guests breathing, in no least degree"
400,20,995,"Grac’d with a human soul, it serves not thee"
400,20,996,"To feast in peace with us, take equal share"
400,20,997,"Of what we reach to, sit, and all things hear"
400,20,998,"That we speak freely, — which no begging guest"
400,20,999,"Did ever yet, — but thou must make request"
400,20,1000,To mix with us in merit of the Queen.
400,20,1001,"But wine inflames thee, that hath ever been"
400,20,1002,The bane of men whoever yet would take
400,20,1003,Th’ excess it offers and the mean forsake.
400,20,1004,"Wine spoil’d the Centaur great Eurytion,"
400,20,1005,In guest - rites with the mighty - minded son
400,20,1006,"Of bold Ixion, in his way to war"
400,20,1007,"Against the Lapithes; who, driv’n as far"
400,20,1008,"As madness with the bold effects of wine,"
400,20,1009,"Did outrage to his kind host, and decline"
400,20,1010,Other heroës from him feasted there
400,20,1011,"With so much anger that they left their cheer,"
400,20,1012,"And dragg’d him forth the fore - court, slit his nose,"
400,20,1013,"Cropp’d both his ears, and, in the ill - dispose"
400,20,1014,"His mind then suffer’d, drew the fatal day"
400,20,1015,On his head with his host; for thence the fray
400,20,1016,Betwixt the Centaurs and the Lapithes
400,20,1017,Had mortal act. But he for his excess
400,20,1018,In spoil of wine fared worse himself; as thou
400,20,1019,"For thy large cups, if thy arms draw the bow,"
400,20,1020,My mind fortells shalt fear; for not a man
400,20,1021,"Of all our consort, that in wisdom can"
400,20,1022,"Boast any fit share, will take prayers then,"
400,20,1023,"But to Echetus, the most stern of men,"
400,20,1024,"A black sail freight with thee, whose worst of ill,"
400,20,1025,"Be sure, is past all ransom. Sit, then, still,"
400,20,1026,"Drink temp’rately, and never more contend"
400,20,1027,With men your youngers.” This the Queen did end
400,20,1028,"With her defence of him, and told his foe"
400,20,1029,It was not fair nor equal t’ overcrow
400,20,1030,The poorest guest her son pleas’d t’ entertain
400,20,1031,In his free turrets with so proud a strain
400,20,1032,"Of threats and bravings; asking if he thought,"
400,20,1033,That if the stranger to his arms had brought
400,20,1034,"The stubborn bow down, he should marry her,"
400,20,1035,"And bear her home? And said, himself should err"
400,20,1036,In no such hope; nor of them all the best
400,20,1037,That griev’d at any good she did her guest
400,20,1038,Should banquet there; since it in no sort show’d
400,20,1039,"Noblesse in them, nor paid her what she ow’d"
400,20,1040,Her own free rule there. This Eurymachus
400,20,1041,"Confirm’d and said: “Nor feeds it hope in us,"
400,20,1042,"Icarius’ daughter, to solemnize rites"
400,20,1043,Of nuptials with thee; nor in noblest sights
400,20,1044,It can show comely; but to our respects
400,20,1045,The rumour both of sexes and of sects
400,20,1046,"Amongst the people would breed shame and fear,"
400,20,1047,"Lest any worst Greek said: ‘See, men that were"
400,20,1048,Of mean deservings will presume t’ aspire
400,20,1049,"To his wife’s bed, whom all men did admire"
400,20,1050,"For fame and merit, could not draw his bow,"
400,20,1051,"And yet his wife had foolish pride to woo,"
400,20,1052,When straight an errant beggar comes and draws
400,20,1053,"The bow with ease, performing all the laws"
400,20,1054,The game besides contain’d’; and this would thus
400,20,1055,Prove both indignity and shame to us.”
400,20,1056,"The Queen replied: “The fame of men, I see,"
400,20,1057,Bears much price in your great suppos’d degree;
400,20,1058,"Yet who can prove amongst the people great,"
400,20,1059,That of one so esteem’d of them the seat
400,20,1060,"Doth so defame and ruin? And beside,"
400,20,1061,With what right is this guest thus vilified
400,20,1062,"In your high censures, when the man in blood"
400,20,1063,"Is well compos’d and great, his parents good?[1]"
400,20,1064,"And therefore give the bow to him, to try"
400,20,1065,His birth and breeding by his chivalry.
400,20,1066,"If his arms draw it, and that Phœbus stands"
400,20,1067,"So great a glory to his strength, my hands"
400,20,1068,"Shall add this guerdon: Ev’ry sort of weed,"
400,20,1069,"A two - edg’d sword, and lance to keep him freed"
400,20,1070,"From dogs and men hereafter, and dismiss"
400,20,1071,His worth to what place tends that heart of his.”
400,20,1072,Her son gave answer: “That it was a wrong
400,20,1073,To his free sway in all things that belong
400,20,1074,"To guard of that house, to demand the bow"
400,20,1075,"Of any Wooer, and the use bestow"
400,20,1076,Upon the stranger: for the bow was his
400,20,1077,To give or to withhold; no masteries
400,20,1078,Of her proposing giving any pow’r
400,20,1079,"T’ impair his right in things for any Wooer,"
400,20,1080,"Or any that rough Ithaca affords,"
400,20,1081,Any that Elis; of which no man’s words
400,20,1082,"Nor pow’rs should curb him, stood he so inclin’d,"
400,20,1083,To see the bow in absolute gift resign’d
400,20,1084,"To that his guest to bear and use at will,"
400,20,1085,And therefore bade his mother keep her still
400,20,1086,Amongst her women at her rock and loom;
400,20,1087,Bows were for men; and this bow did become
400,20,1088,"Past all men’s his disposure, since his sire"
400,20,1089,"Left it to him, and all the house entire.”"
400,20,1090,"She stood dismay’d at this, and in her mind"
400,20,1091,"His wise words laid up, standing so inclin’d"
400,20,1092,"As he had will’d, with all her women going"
400,20,1093,"Up to her chamber, there her tears bestowing,"
400,20,1094,"As ev’ry night she did, on her lov’d lord,"
400,20,1095,Till sleep and Pallas her fit rest restor’d.
400,20,1096,"The bow Eumæus took, and bore away;"
400,20,1097,"Which up in tumult, and almost in fray,"
400,20,1098,"Put all the Wooers, one enquiring thus:"
400,20,1099,"“Whither, rogue, abject, wilt thou bear from us"
400,20,1100,"That bow propos’d? Lay down, or I protest"
400,20,1101,"Thy dogs shall eat thee, that thou nourishest"
400,20,1102,"To guard thy swine; amongst whom, left of all,"
400,20,1103,"Thy life shall leave thee, if the festival,"
400,20,1104,"We now observe to Phœbus, may our zeals"
400,20,1105,"Grace with his aid, and all the Deities else.”"
400,20,1106,This threat made good Eumæus yield the bow
400,20,1107,"To his late place, not knowing what might grow"
400,20,1108,From such a multitude. And then fell on
400,20,1109,"Telemachus with threats, and said: “Set gone"
400,20,1110,That bow yet further; ’tis no servant’s part
400,20,1111,To serve too many masters; raise your heart
400,20,1112,"And bear it off, lest, though you’re younger, yet"
400,20,1113,With stones I pelt you to the field with it.
400,20,1114,"If you and I close, I shall prove too strong."
400,20,1115,I wish as much too hard for all this throng
400,20,1116,"The Gods would make me, I should quickly send"
400,20,1117,"Some after with just sorrow to their end,"
400,20,1118,"They waste my victuals so, and ply my cup,"
400,20,1119,And do me such shrewd turns still.” This put up
400,20,1120,"The Wooers all in laughters, and put down"
400,20,1121,"Their angers to him, that so late were grown"
400,20,1122,So grave and bloody; which resolv’d that fear
400,20,1123,"Of good Eumæus, who did take and bear"
400,20,1124,"The King the bow; call’d nurse, and bade her make"
400,20,1125,"The doors all sure, that if men’s tumults take"
400,20,1126,"The ears of some within, they may not fly,"
400,20,1127,But keep at work still close and silently.
400,20,1128,"These words put wings to her, and close she put"
400,20,1129,The chamber door. The court - gates then were shut
400,20,1130,"By kind Philœtius, who straight did go"
400,20,1131,"From out the hall, and in the portico"
400,20,1132,"Found laid a gable of a ship, compos’d"
400,20,1133,"Of spongy bulrushes; with which he clos’d,"
400,20,1134,"In winding round about them, the court - gates,"
400,20,1135,"Then took his place again, to view the fates"
400,20,1136,"That quickly follow’d. When he came, he saw"
400,20,1137,"Ulysses viewing, ere he tried to draw,"
400,20,1138,"The famous bow, which ev’ry way he mov’d,"
400,20,1139,Up and down turning it; in which be prov’d
400,20,1140,"The plight it was in, fearing, chiefly, lest"
400,20,1141,The horns were eat with worms in so long rest.
400,20,1142,"But what his thoughts intended turning so,"
400,20,1143,"And keeping such a search about the bow,"
400,20,1144,"The Wooers little knowing fell to jest,"
400,20,1145,And said: “Past doubt he is a man profest
400,20,1146,"In bowyers’ craft, and sees quite through the wood;"
400,20,1147,"Or something, certain, to be understood"
400,20,1148,There is in this his turning of it still.
400,20,1149,A cunning rogue he is at any ill.”
400,20,1150,"Then spake another proud one: “Would to heav’n,"
400,20,1151,"I might, at will, get gold till he hath giv’n"
400,20,1152,That bow his draught!” With these sharp jests did these
400,20,1153,Delightsome Woo’rs their fatal humours please.
400,20,1154,But when the wise Ulysses once had laid
400,20,1155,"His fingers on it, and to proof survey’d"
400,20,1156,"The still sound plight it held, as one of skill"
400,20,1157,"In song, and of the harp, doth at his will,"
400,20,1158,"In tuning of his instrument, extend"
400,20,1159,"A string out with his pin, touch all, and lend"
400,20,1160,"To ev’ry well - wreath’d string his perfect sound,"
400,20,1161,Struck all together; with such ease drew round
400,20,1162,"The King the bow. Then twang’d he up the string,"
400,20,1163,That as a swallow in the air doth sing
400,20,1164,"With no continued tune, but, pausing still,"
400,20,1165,Twinks out her scatter’d voice in accents shrill;
400,20,1166,"So sharp the string sung when he gave it touch,"
400,20,1167,Once having bent and drawn it. Which so much
400,20,1168,"Amaz’d the Wooers, that their colours went"
400,20,1169,And came most grievously. And then Jove rent
400,20,1170,The air with thunder; which at heart did cheer
400,20,1171,"The now - enough - sustaining traveller,"
400,20,1172,That Jove again would his attempt enable.
400,20,1173,"Then took he into hand, from off the table,"
400,20,1174,The first drawn arrow: and a number more
400,20,1175,Spent shortly on the Wooers; but this one
400,20,1176,"He measur’d by his arm, as if not known"
400,20,1177,"The length were to him, nock’d it then, and drew;"
400,20,1178,"And through the axes, at the first hole, flew"
400,20,1179,The steel - charg’d arrow; which when he had done
400,20,1180,He thus bespake the Prince: “You have not won
400,20,1181,Disgrace yet by your guest; for I have strook
400,20,1182,"The mark I shot at, and no such toil took"
400,20,1183,In wearying the bow with fat and fire
400,20,1184,"As did the Wooers. Yet reserv’d entire,"
400,20,1185,"Thank Heav’n, my strength is, and myself am tried,"
400,20,1186,No man to be so basely vilified
400,20,1187,"As these men pleas’d to think me. But, free way"
400,20,1188,"Take that, and all their pleasures; and while day"
400,20,1189,"Holds her torch to you, and the hour of feast"
400,20,1190,"Hath now full date, give banquet, and the rest,"
400,20,1191,"Poem and harp, that grace a well - fill’d board.”"
400,20,1192,"This said, he beckon’d to his son; whose sword"
400,20,1193,"He straight girt to him, took to hand his lance,"
400,20,1194,And cómplete - arm’d did to his sire advance.

400,20,1197,THE TWENTY - SECOND BOOK OF HOMER’S ODYSSEYS
400,20,1198,THE ARGUMENT
400,20,1199,The Wooers in Minerva’s sight
400,20,1200,Slain by Ulysses; all the light
400,20,1201,And lustful housewives by his son
400,20,1202,And servants are to slaughter done.
400,20,1203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,20,1204,_Χι̑._
400,20,1205,"The end of pride,"
400,20,1206,"And lawless lust,"
400,20,1207,Is wretched tried
400,20,1208,With slaughters just.
400,20,1209,The upper rags that wise Ulysses wore
400,20,1210,"Cast off, he rusheth to the great hall door"
400,20,1211,"With bow and quiver full of shafts, which down"
400,20,1212,"He pour’d before his feet, and thus made known"
400,20,1213,His true state to the Wooers: “This strife thus
400,20,1214,Hath harmless been decided; now for us
400,20,1215,"There rests another mark, more hard to hit,"
400,20,1216,And such as never man before hath smit;
400,20,1217,"Whose full point likewise my hands shall assay,"
400,20,1218,And try if Phœbus will give me his day.”
400,20,1219,"He said, and off his bitter arrow thrust"
400,20,1220,Right at Antinous; and struck him just
400,20,1221,"As he was lifting up the bowl, to show"
400,20,1222,That ’twixt the cup and lip much ill may grow.
400,20,1223,Death touch’d not at his thoughts at feast; for who
400,20,1224,Would think that he alone could perish so
400,20,1225,"Amongst so many, and he best of all?"
400,20,1226,"The arrow in his throat took full his fall,"
400,20,1227,And thrust his head far through the other side.
400,20,1228,"Down fell his cup, down he, down all his pride;"
400,20,1229,Straight from his nostrils gush’d the human gore;
400,20,1230,"And, as he fell, his feet far overbore"
400,20,1231,The feastful table; all the roast and bread
400,20,1232,About the house strew’d. When his high - born head
400,20,1233,"The rest beheld so low, up rush’d they all,"
400,20,1234,And ransack’d ev’ry corner of the hall
400,20,1235,For shields and darts; but all fled far their reach.
400,20,1236,"Then fell they foul on him with terrible speech,"
400,20,1237,And told him it should prove the dearest shaft
400,20,1238,That ever pass’d him; and that now was saft
400,20,1239,"No shift for him, but sure and sudden death;"
400,20,1240,"For he had slain a man, whose like did breathe"
400,20,1241,In no part of the kingdom; and that now
400,20,1242,"He should no more for games strive with his bow,"
400,20,1243,"But vultures eat him there. These threats they spent,"
400,20,1244,Yet ev’ry man believ’d that stern event
400,20,1245,"Chanc’d ’gainst the author’s will. O fools, to think"
400,20,1246,That all their rest had any cup to drink
400,20,1247,But what their great Antinous began!
400,20,1248,"He, frowning, said: “Dogs, see in me the man"
400,20,1249,Ye all held dead at Troy. My house it is
400,20,1250,"That thus ye spoil, and thus your luxuries"
400,20,1251,File with my women’s rapes; in which ye woo
400,20,1252,"The wife of one that lives, and no thought show"
400,20,1253,"Of man’s fit fear, or God’s, your present fame,"
400,20,1254,Or any fair sense of your future name;
400,20,1255,"And, therefore, present and eternal death"
400,20,1256,Shall end your base life.” This made fresh fears breathe
400,20,1257,Their former boldness. Ev’ry man had eye
400,20,1258,"On all the means, and studied ways to fly"
400,20,1259,"So deep deaths imminent. But seeing none,"
400,20,1260,Eurymachus began with suppliant moan
400,20,1261,"To move his pity, saying: “If you be"
400,20,1262,"This isle’s Ulysses, we must all agree,"
400,20,1263,"In grant of your reproof’s integrity,"
400,20,1264,"The Greeks have done you many a wrong at home,"
400,20,1265,At field as many. But of all the sum
400,20,1266,Lies here contract in death; for only he
400,20,1267,Impos’d the whole ill - offices that we
400,20,1268,"Are now made guilty of, and not so much"
400,20,1269,"Sought his endeavours, or in thought did touch"
400,20,1270,"At any nuptials, but a greater thing"
400,20,1271,Employ’d his forces; for to be our king
400,20,1272,Was his chief object; his sole plot it was
400,20,1273,"To kill your son, which Jove’s hand would not pass,"
400,20,1274,But set it to his own most merited end.
400,20,1275,"In which end your just anger, nor extend"
400,20,1276,Your stern wreak further; spend your royal pow’rs
400,20,1277,In mild ruth of your people; we are yours;
400,20,1278,And whatsoever waste of wine or food
400,20,1279,"Our liberties have made, we’ll make all good"
400,20,1280,"In restitutions. Call a court, and pass"
400,20,1281,"A fine of twenty oxen, gold, and brass,"
400,20,1282,"On ev’ry head, and raise your most rates still,"
400,20,1283,Till you are pleas’d with your confesséd fill.
400,20,1284,"Which if we fail to tender, all your wrath"
400,20,1285,It shall be justice in our bloods to bathe.”
400,20,1286,"“Eurymachus,” said he, “if you would give"
400,20,1287,"All that your fathers’ hoard, to make ye live,"
400,20,1288,"And all that ever you yourselves possess,"
400,20,1289,"Or shall by any industry increase,"
400,20,1290,"I would not cease from slaughter, till your bloods"
400,20,1291,Had bought out your intemp’rance in my goods.
400,20,1292,It rests now for you that you either fight
400,20,1293,"That will ’scape death, or make your way by flight."
400,20,1294,"In whose best choice, my thoughts conceive, not one"
400,20,1295,Shall shun the death your first hath undergone.”
400,20,1296,"This quite dissolv’d their knees. Eurymachus,"
400,20,1297,"Enforcing all their fears, yet counsell’d thus:"
400,20,1298,"“O friends! This man, now he hath got the bow"
400,20,1299,"And quiver by him, ever will bestow"
400,20,1300,"His most inaccessible hands at us,"
400,20,1301,"And never leave, if we avoid him thus,"
400,20,1302,Till he hath strewn the pavement with us all;
400,20,1303,"And, therefore, join we swords, and on him fall"
400,20,1304,"With tables forc’d up, and borne in oppos’d"
400,20,1305,"Against his sharp shafts; when, being round - enclos’d"
400,20,1306,"By all our onsets, we shall either take"
400,20,1307,"His horrid person, or for safety make"
400,20,1308,His rage retire from out the hall and gates;
400,20,1309,"And then, if he escape, we’ll make our states"
400,20,1310,Known to the city by our gen’ral cry.
400,20,1311,And thus this man shall let his last shaft fly
400,20,1312,That ever his hand vaunted.” Thus he drew
400,20,1313,His sharp - edg’d sword; and with a table flew
400,20,1314,"In on Ulysses, with a terrible throat"
400,20,1315,His fierce charge urging. But Ulysses smote
400,20,1316,"The board, and cleft it through from end to end"
400,20,1317,Borne at his breast; and made his shaft extend
400,20,1318,"His sharp head to his liver, his broad breast"
400,20,1319,Pierc’d at his nipple; when his hand releast
400,20,1320,"Forthwith his sword, that fell and kiss’d the ground,"
400,20,1321,With cups and victuals lying scatter’d round
400,20,1322,About the pavement; amongst which his brow
400,20,1323,"Knock’d the imbrued earth, while in pains did flow"
400,20,1324,"His vital spirits, till his heels shook out"
400,20,1325,"His feastful life, and hurl’d a throne about"
400,20,1326,That way - laid death’s convulsions in his feet;
400,20,1327,When from his tender eyes the light did fleet.
400,20,1328,Then charg’d Amphinomus with his drawn blade
400,20,1329,"The glorious king, in purpose to have made"
400,20,1330,His feet forsake the house; but his assay
400,20,1331,"The prince prevented, and his lance gave way"
400,20,1332,"Quite through his shoulder, at his back; his breast"
400,20,1333,The fierce pile letting forth. His ruin prest
400,20,1334,"Groans from the pavement, which his forehead strook."
400,20,1335,Telemachus his long lance then forsook —
400,20,1336,Left in Amphinomus — and to his sire
400,20,1337,"Made fiery pass, not staying to acquire"
400,20,1338,"His lance again, in doubt that, while he drew"
400,20,1339,"The fixéd pile, some other might renew"
400,20,1340,"Fierce charge upon him, and his unharm’d head"
400,20,1341,Cleave with his back - drawn sword; for which he fled
400,20,1342,"Close to his father, bade him arm, and he"
400,20,1343,"Would bring him shield and jav’lins instantly,"
400,20,1344,"His own head arming, more arms laying by"
400,20,1345,To serve the swine - herd and the oxen - herd.
400,20,1346,_Valour well arm’d is ever most preferr’d._
400,20,1347,"“Run then,” said he, “and come before the last"
400,20,1348,"Of these auxiliary shafts are past,"
400,20,1349,"For fear, lest, left alone, they force my stand"
400,20,1350,"From forth the ports.” He flew, and brought to hand"
400,20,1351,"Eight darts, four shields, four helms. His own parts then"
400,20,1352,"First put in arms, he furnish’d both his men,"
400,20,1353,"That to their king stood close; but he, as long"
400,20,1354,"As he had shafts to friend, enough was strong"
400,20,1355,"For all the Wooers, and some one man still"
400,20,1356,"He made make even with earth, till all a hill"
400,20,1357,"Had rais’d in th’ even - floor’d hall. His last shaft spent,"
400,20,1358,"He set his bow against a beam, and went"
400,20,1359,"To arm at all parts, while the other three"
400,20,1360,"Kept off the Wooers, who, unarm’d, could be"
400,20,1361,No great assailants. In the well - built wall
400,20,1362,"A window was thrust out, at end of all"
400,20,1363,The house’s entry; on whose utter side
400,20,1364,"There lay a way to town, and in it wide"
400,20,1365,"And two - leav’d folds were forg’d, that gave fit mean"
400,20,1366,"For flyers - out; and, therefore, at it then"
400,20,1367,Ulysses plac’d Eumæus in close guard;
400,20,1368,"One only pass ope to it, which (prepar’d"
400,20,1369,In this sort by Ulysses ’gainst all pass)
400,20,1370,By Agelaus’ tardy memory was
400,20,1371,"In question call’d, who bade some one ascend"
400,20,1372,"At such a window, and bring straight to friend"
400,20,1373,"The city with his clamour, that this man"
400,20,1374,Might quickly shoot his last. “This no one can
400,20,1375,"Make safe access to,” said Melanthius,"
400,20,1376,"“For ’tis too near the hall’s fair doors, whence thus"
400,20,1377,The man afflicts ye; for from thence there lies
400,20,1378,"But one strait passage to it, that denies"
400,20,1379,"Access to all, if any one man stand,"
400,20,1380,"Being one of courage, and will countermand"
400,20,1381,Our offer to it. But I know a way
400,20,1382,"To bring you arms, from where the King doth lay"
400,20,1383,His whole munition; and believe there is
400,20,1384,No other place to all the armories
400,20,1385,"Both of himself and son.” This said, a pair"
400,20,1386,"Of lofty stairs he climb’d, and to th’ affair"
400,20,1387,"Twelve shields, twelve lances brought, as many casques"
400,20,1388,With horsehair plumes; and set to bitter tasks
400,20,1389,"Both son and sire. Then shrunk Ulysses’ knees,"
400,20,1390,"And his lov’d heart, when thus in arms he sees"
400,20,1391,"So many Wooers, and their shaken darts;"
400,20,1392,For then the work show’d as it ask’d more parts
400,20,1393,"To safe performance, and he told his son"
400,20,1394,That or Melanthius or his maids had done
400,20,1395,A deed that foul war to their hands conferr’d.
400,20,1396,"“O father,” he replied, “’tis I have err’d"
400,20,1397,"In this caus’d labour; I, and none but I,"
400,20,1398,That left the door ope of your armoury.
400,20,1399,"But some, it seems, hath set a sharper eye"
400,20,1400,On that important place. Eumæus! Haste
400,20,1401,"And shut the door, observing who hath past"
400,20,1402,"To this false action; any maid, or one"
400,20,1403,"That I suspect more, which is Dolius’ son.”"
400,20,1404,"While these spake thus, Melanthius went again"
400,20,1405,For more fair arms; when the renownéd swain
400,20,1406,"Eumæus saw, and told Ulysses straight"
400,20,1407,It was the hateful man that his conceit
400,20,1408,"Before suspected, who had done that ill;"
400,20,1409,"And, being again there, ask’d if he should kill,"
400,20,1410,"If his pow’r serv’d, or he should bring the swain"
400,20,1411,"To him, t’ inflict on him a sev’ral pain"
400,20,1412,For ev’ry forfeit he had made his house.
400,20,1413,He answer’d: “I and my Telemachus
400,20,1414,"Will here contain these proud ones in despite,"
400,20,1415,How much soever these stol’n arms excite
400,20,1416,"Their guilty courages, while you two take"
400,20,1417,Possession of the chamber. The doors make
400,20,1418,"Sure at your back, and then, surprising him,"
400,20,1419,"His feet and hands bind, wrapping ev’ry limb"
400,20,1420,In pliant chains; and with a halter cast
400,20,1421,Above the wind - beam — at himself made fast —
400,20,1422,Aloft the column draw him; where alive
400,20,1423,"He long may hang, and pains enough deprive"
400,20,1424,His vexéd life before his death succeed.”
400,20,1425,"This charge, soon heard, as soon they put to deed,"
400,20,1426,"Stole on his stealth, and at the further end"
400,20,1427,Of all the chamber saw him busily bend
400,20,1428,"His hands to more arms, when they, still at door,"
400,20,1429,"Watch’d his return. At last he came, and bore"
400,20,1430,"In one hand a fair helm, in th’ other held"
400,20,1431,"A broad and ancient rusty - rested shield,"
400,20,1432,"That old Laertes in his youth had worn,"
400,20,1433,Of which the cheek - bands had with age been torn.
400,20,1434,"They rush’d upon him, caught him by the hair,"
400,20,1435,"And dragg’d him in again; whom, crying out,"
400,20,1436,"They cast upon the pavement, wrapp’d about"
400,20,1437,"With sure and pinching cords both foot and hand,"
400,20,1438,"And then, in full act of their King’s command,"
400,20,1439,"A pliant chain bestow’d on him, and hal’d"
400,20,1440,"His body up the column, till he scal’d"
400,20,1441,"The highest wind - beam; where made firmly fast,"
400,20,1442,Eumæus on his just infliction past
400,20,1443,This pleasurable cavil: “Now you may
400,20,1444,"All night keep watch here, and the earliest day"
400,20,1445,"Discern, being hung so high, to rouse from rest"
400,20,1446,Your dainty cattle to the Wooers’ feast.
400,20,1447,"There, as befits a man of means so fair,"
400,20,1448,"Soft may you sleep, nought under you but air;"
400,20,1449,"And so long hang you.” Thus they left him there,"
400,20,1450,"Made fast the door, and with Ulysses were"
400,20,1451,"All arm’d in th’ instant. Then they all stood close,"
400,20,1452,"Their minds fire breath’d in flames against their foes,"
400,20,1453,Four in th’ entry fighting all alone;
400,20,1454,When from the hall charg’d many a mighty one.
400,20,1455,"But to them then Jove’s seed, Minerva, came,"
400,20,1456,Resembling Mentor both in voice and frame
400,20,1457,Of manly person. Passing well apaid
400,20,1458,"Ulysses was, and said: “Now, Mentor, aid"
400,20,1459,’Gainst these odd mischiefs; call to memory now
400,20,1460,"My often good to thee, and that we two"
400,20,1461,"Of one year’s life are.” Thus he said, but thought"
400,20,1462,"ft was Minerva, that had ever brought"
400,20,1463,"To her side safety. On the other part,"
400,20,1464,The Wooers threaten’d; but the chief in heart
400,20,1465,"Was Agelaus, who to Mentor spake:"
400,20,1466,“Mentor! Let no words of Ulysses make
400,20,1467,Thy hand a fighter on his feeble side
400,20,1468,‘Gainst all us Wooers; for we firm abide
400,20,1469,"In this persuasion, that when sire and son"
400,20,1470,"Our swords have slain, thy life is sure to run"
400,20,1471,One fortune with them. What strange acts hast thou
400,20,1472,Conceit to form here? Thy head must bestow
400,20,1473,The wreak of theirs on us. And when thy pow’rs
400,20,1474,"Are taken down by these fierce steels of ours,"
400,20,1475,"All thy possessions, in - doors and without,"
400,20,1476,Must raise on heap with his; and all thy rout
400,20,1477,Of sons and daughters in thy turrets bleed
400,20,1478,Wreak off’rings to us; and our town stand freed
400,20,1479,Of all charge with thy wife.” Minerva’s heart
400,20,1480,"Was fir’d with these braves, the approv’d desert"
400,20,1481,"Of her Ulysses chiding, saying: “No more"
400,20,1482,Thy force nor fortitude as heretofore
400,20,1483,Will gain thee glory; when nine years at Troy
400,20,1484,White - wristed Helen’s rescue did employ
400,20,1485,"Thy arms and wisdom, still and ever us’d,"
400,20,1486,The bloods of thousands through the field diffus’d
400,20,1487,By thy vast valour; Priam’s broad - way’d town
400,20,1488,By thy grave parts was sack’d and overthrown;
400,20,1489,"And now, amongst thy people and thy goods,"
400,20,1490,Against the Wooers’ base and petulant bloods
400,20,1491,Stint’st thou thy valour? Rather mourning here
400,20,1492,"Than manly fighting? Come, friend, stand we near,"
400,20,1493,"And note my labour, that thou may’st discern"
400,20,1494,Amongst thy foes how Mentor’s nerves will earn
400,20,1495,"All thy old bounties.” This she spake, but stay’d"
400,20,1496,Her hand from giving each - way - often - sway’d
400,20,1497,"Uncertain conquest to his certain use,"
400,20,1498,But still would try what self - pow’rs would produce
400,20,1499,Both in the father and the glorious son.
400,20,1500,Then on the wind - beam that along did ron
400,20,1501,"The smoky roof, transform’d, Minerva sat,"
400,20,1502,Like to a swallow; sometimes cuffing at
400,20,1503,"The swords and lances, rushing from her seat,"
400,20,1504,And up and down the troubl’d house did beat
400,20,1505,Her wing at ev’ry motion. And as she
400,20,1506,Had rous’d Ulysses; so the enemy
400,20,1507,"Damastor’s son excited, Polybus,"
400,20,1508,"Amphinomus, and Demoptolemus,"
400,20,1509,"Eurynomus, and Polyctorides;"
400,20,1510,For these were men that of the wooing prease
400,20,1511,"Were most egregious, and the clearly best"
400,20,1512,In strength of hand of all the desp’rate rest
400,20,1513,"That yet surviv’d, and now fought for their souls;"
400,20,1514,Which straight swift arrows sent among the fowls.
400,20,1515,"But first, Damastor’s son had more spare breath"
400,20,1516,"To spend on their excitements ere his death,"
400,20,1517,And said: That now Ulysses would forbear
400,20,1518,"His dismal hand, since Mentor’s spirit was there,"
400,20,1519,And blew vain vaunts about Ulysses’ ears;
400,20,1520,"In whose trust he would cease his massacres,"
400,20,1521,"Rest him, and put his friend’s huge boasts in proof;"
400,20,1522,And so was he beneath the entry’s roof
400,20,1523,Left with Telemachus and th’ other two.
400,20,1524,"“At whom,” said he, “discharge no darts, but throw"
400,20,1525,"All at Ulysses, rousing his faint rest;"
400,20,1526,"Whom if we slaughter, by our interest"
400,20,1527,"In Jove’s assistance, all the rest may yield"
400,20,1528,"Our pow’rs no care, when he strews once the field.”"
400,20,1529,"As he then will’d, they all at random threw"
400,20,1530,Where they suppos’d he rested; and then flew
400,20,1531,"Minerva after ev’ry dart, and made"
400,20,1532,"Some strike the threshold, some the walls invade,"
400,20,1533,"Some beat the doors, and all acts render’d vain"
400,20,1534,"Their grave steel offer’d. Which escap’d, again”"
400,20,1535,"Came on Ulysses, saying: “O that we"
400,20,1536,The Wooers’ troop with our joint archery
400,20,1537,"Might so assail, that where their spirits dream"
400,20,1538,"On our deaths first, we first may slaughter them!”"
400,20,1539,"Thus the much - suff’rer said; and all let - fly,"
400,20,1540,When ev’ry man struck dead his enemy.
400,20,1541,Ulysses slaughter’d Demoptolemus.
400,20,1542,Euryades by young Telemachus
400,20,1543,His death encounter’d. Good Eumæus slew
400,20,1544,Elatus. And Philœtius overthrew
400,20,1545,Pisander. All which tore the pavéd floor
400,20,1546,Up with their teeth. The rest retir’d before
400,20,1547,Their second charge to inner rooms; and then
400,20,1548,Ulysses follow’d; from the slaughter’d men
400,20,1549,"Their darts first drawing. While which work was done,"
400,20,1550,The Wooers threw with huge contention
400,20,1551,To kill them all; when with her swallow - wing
400,20,1552,"Minerva cuff’d, and made their jav’lins ring"
400,20,1553,"Against the doors and thresholds, as before."
400,20,1554,Some yet did graze upon their marks. One tore
400,20,1555,"The prince’s wrist, which was Amphimedon,"
400,20,1556,Th’ extreme part of the skin but touch’d upon.
400,20,1557,Ctesippus over good Eumeeus’ shield
400,20,1558,His shoulder’s top did taint; which yet did yield
400,20,1559,"The lance free pass, and gave his hurt the ground."
400,20,1560,"Again then charg’d the Wooers, and girt round"
400,20,1561,"Ulysses with their lances; who turn’d head,"
400,20,1562,And with his jav’lin struck Eurydamas dead.
400,20,1563,Telemachus disliv’d Amphimedon;
400,20,1564,"Eumæus, Polybus; Philœtius won"
400,20,1565,"Ctesippus’ bosom with his dart, and said,"
400,20,1566,"In quittance of the jester’s part he play’d,"
400,20,1567,"The neat’s foot hurling at Ulysses: “Now,"
400,20,1568,"Great son of Polytherses, you that vow"
400,20,1569,"Your wit to bitter taunts, and love to wound"
400,20,1570,"The heart of any with a jest, so crown’d"
400,20,1571,"Your wit be with a laughter, never yielding"
400,20,1572,"To fools in folly, but your glory building"
400,20,1573,"On putting down in fooling, spitting forth"
400,20,1574,"Puff’d words at all sorts, cease to scoff at worth,"
400,20,1575,"And leave revenge of vile words to the Gods,"
400,20,1576,Since their wits bear the sharper edge by odds;
400,20,1577,"And, in the mean time, take the dart I drave,"
400,20,1578,For that right hospitable foot you gave
400,20,1579,"Divine Ulysses, begging but his own.”"
400,20,1580,Thus spake the black - ox - herdsman; and straight down
400,20,1581,Ulysses struck another with his dart —
400,20,1582,"Damastor’s son. Telemachus did part,"
400,20,1583,"Just in the midst, the belly of the fair"
400,20,1584,Evenor’s son; his fierce pile taking air
400,20,1585,"Out at his back. Flat fell he on his face,"
400,20,1586,"His whole brows knocking, and did mark the place."
400,20,1587,And now man - slaught’ring Pallas took in hand
400,20,1588,"Her snake - fring’d shield, and on that beam took stand"
400,20,1589,"In her true form, where swallow - like she sat."
400,20,1590,"And then, in this way of the house and that,"
400,20,1591,"The Wooers, wounded at the heart with fear,"
400,20,1592,Fled the encounter; as in pastures where
400,20,1593,"Fat herds of oxen feed, about the field"
400,20,1594,(As if wild madness their instincts impell’d)
400,20,1595,"The high - fed bullocks fly, whom in the spring,"
400,20,1596,"When days are long, gad - bees or breezes sting."
400,20,1597,"Ulysses and his son the flyers chas’d,"
400,20,1598,"As when, with crooked beaks and seres, a cast"
400,20,1599,"Of hill - bred eagles, cast - off at some game,"
400,20,1600,"That yet their strengths keep, but, put up, in flame"
400,20,1601,"The eagle stoops; from which, along the field"
400,20,1602,"The poor fowls make wing, this and that way yield"
400,20,1603,"Their hard - flown pinions, then the clouds assay"
400,20,1604,"For ’scape or shelter, their forlorn dismay"
400,20,1605,"All spirit exhaling, all wings’ strength to carry"
400,20,1606,"Their bodies forth, and, truss’d up, to the quarry"
400,20,1607,"Their falconers ride - in, and rejoice to see"
400,20,1608,Their hawks perform a flight so fervently;
400,20,1609,"So, in their flight, Ulysses with his heir"
400,20,1610,"Did stoop and cuff the Wooers, that the air"
400,20,1611,"Broke in vast sighs, whose heads they shot and cleft,"
400,20,1612,The pavement boiling with the souls they reft.
400,20,1613,"Liodes, running to Ulysses, took"
400,20,1614,"His knees, and thus did on his name invoke;"
400,20,1615,“Ulysses! Let me pray thee to my place
400,20,1616,"Afford the rev’rence, and to me the grace;"
400,20,1617,"That never did or said, to any dame"
400,20,1618,"Thy court contain’d, or deed, or word to blame;"
400,20,1619,But others so affected I have made
400,20,1620,"I lay down their insolence; and, if the trade"
400,20,1621,They kept with wickedness have made them still
400,20,1622,"Despise my speech, and use their wonted ill,"
400,20,1623,"They have their penance by the stroke of death,"
400,20,1624,Which their desert divinely warranteth.
400,20,1625,"But I am priest amongst them, and shall I"
400,20,1626,That nought have done worth death amongst them die?
400,20,1627,From thee this proverb then will men derive:
400,20,1628,_Good turns do never their mere deeds survive.”_
400,20,1629,"He, bending his displeaséd forehead, said:"
400,20,1630,"“If you be priest among them, as you plead,"
400,20,1631,"Yet you would marry, and with my wife too,"
400,20,1632,And have descent by her. For all that woo
400,20,1633,"Wish to obtain, which they should never do,"
400,20,1634,Dames’ husbands living. You must therefore pray
400,20,1635,"Of force, and oft in Court here, that the day"
400,20,1636,Of my return for him might never shine;
400,20,1637,"The death to me wish’d, therefore, shall be thine.”"
400,20,1638,"This said, he took a sword up that was cast"
400,20,1639,"From Agelaus, having struck his last,"
400,20,1640,And on the priest’s mid neck he laid a stroke
400,20,1641,"That struck his head off, tumbling as he spoke."
400,20,1642,Then did the poet Phemius (whose surname
400,20,1643,Was call’d Terpiades; who thither came
400,20,1644,Forc’d by the Wooers) fly death; but being near
400,20,1645,"The court’s great gate, he stood, and parted there"
400,20,1646,In two his counsels; either to remove
400,20,1647,And take the altar of Herceian Jove
400,20,1648,"(Made sacred to him, with a world of art"
400,20,1649,"Engrav’n about it, where were wont t’ impart"
400,20,1650,Laertes and Ulysses many a thigh
400,20,1651,Of broad - brow’d oxen to the Deity)
400,20,1652,"Or venture to Ulysses, clasp his knee,"
400,20,1653,And pray his ruth. The last was the decree
400,20,1654,His choice resolv’d on. ’Twixt the royal throne
400,20,1655,And that fair table that the bowl stood on
400,20,1656,"With which they sacrific’d, his harp he laid"
400,20,1657,"Along the earth, the King’s knees hugg’d, and said:"
400,20,1658,“Ulysses! Let my pray’rs obtain of thee
400,20,1659,"My sacred skill’s respect, and ruth to me!"
400,20,1660,It will hereafter grieve thee to have slain
400,20,1661,"A poet, that doth sing to Gods and men."
400,20,1662,"I of myself am taught, for God alone"
400,20,1663,"All sorts of song hath in my bosom sown,"
400,20,1664,"And I, as to a God, will sing to thee;"
400,20,1665,Then do not thou deal like the priest with me.
400,20,1666,"Thine own lov’d son Telemachus will say,"
400,20,1667,"That not to beg here, nor with willing way"
400,20,1668,"Was my access to thy high court addrest,"
400,20,1669,"To give the Wooers my song after feast,"
400,20,1670,"But, being many, and so much more strong,"
400,20,1671,"They forced me hither, and compell’d my song.”"
400,20,1672,"This did the prince’s sacred virtue hear,"
400,20,1673,"And to the King, his father, said: “Forbear"
400,20,1674,To mix the guiltless with the guilty’s blood.
400,20,1675,And with him likewise let our mercies save
400,20,1676,"Medon the herald, that did still behave"
400,20,1677,Himself with care of my good from a child;
400,20,1678,"If by Eumæus yet he be not kill’d,"
400,20,1679,"Or by Philœtius, nor your fury met,"
400,20,1680,While all this blood about the house it swet.”
400,20,1681,"This Medon heard, as lying hid beneath"
400,20,1682,"A throne set near, half - dead with fear of death;"
400,20,1683,"A new - flay’d ox - hide, as but there thrown by,"
400,20,1684,"His serious shroud made, he lying there to fly."
400,20,1685,"But hearing this he quickly left the throne,"
400,20,1686,"His ox - hide cast as quickly, and as soon"
400,20,1687,"The prince’s knees seiz’d, saying: “O my love,"
400,20,1688,"I am not slain, but here alive and move."
400,20,1689,"Abstain yourself, and do not see your sire"
400,20,1690,Quench with my cold blood the unmeasur’d fire
400,20,1691,"That flames in his strength, making spoil of me,"
400,20,1692,"His wrath’s right, for the Wooers’ injury.”"
400,20,1693,"Ulysses smil’d, and said: “Be confident"
400,20,1694,"This man hath sav’d and made thee different,"
400,20,1695,"To let thee know, and say, and others see,"
400,20,1696,_Good life is much more safe than villany._
400,20,1697,"Go then, sit free without from death within."
400,20,1698,This much - renownéd singer from the sin
400,20,1699,"Of these men likewise quit. Both rest you there,"
400,20,1700,While I my house purge as it fits me here.”
400,20,1701,"This said, they went and took their seat without"
400,20,1702,"At Jove’s high altar, looking round about,"
400,20,1703,Expecting still their slaughter. When the King
400,20,1704,"Search’d round the hall, to try life’s hidden wing"
400,20,1705,Made from more death. But all laid prostrate there
400,20,1706,"In blood and gore he saw. Whole shoals they were,"
400,20,1707,And lay as thick as in a hollow creek
400,20,1708,"Without the white sea, when the fishers break"
400,20,1709,"Their many - mesh’d draught - net up, there lie"
400,20,1710,"Fish frisking on the sands, and fain the dry"
400,20,1711,"Would for the wet change, but th’ all - seeing beam"
400,20,1712,The sun exhales hath suck’d their lives from them;
400,20,1713,So one by other sprawl’d the Wooers there.
400,20,1714,Ulysses and his son then bid appear
400,20,1715,"The nurse Euryclea, to let her hear"
400,20,1716,His mind in something fit for her affair.
400,20,1717,"He op’d the door, and call’d, and said: “Repair,"
400,20,1718,"Grave matron long since born, that art our spy"
400,20,1719,To all this house’s servile housewif’ry;
400,20,1720,"My father calls thee, to impart some thought"
400,20,1721,That asks thy action.” His word found in nought
400,20,1722,"Her slack observance, who straight op’d the door"
400,20,1723,And enter’d to him; when himself before
400,20,1724,Had left the hall. But there the King she view’d
400,20,1725,"Amongst the slain, with blood and gore imbrued."
400,20,1726,"And as a lion skulking all in night,"
400,20,1727,"Far - off in pastures, and come home, all dight"
400,20,1728,In jaws and breast - locks with an ox’s blood
400,20,1729,"New feasted on him, his looks full of mood;"
400,20,1730,"So look’d Ulysses, all his hands and feet"
400,20,1731,Freckled with purple. When which sight did greet
400,20,1732,The poor old woman (such works being for eyes
400,20,1733,"Of no soft temper) out she brake in cries,"
400,20,1734,"Whose vent, though throughly open’d, he yet clos’d,"
400,20,1735,"Call’d her more near, and thus her plaints compos’d:"
400,20,1736,"“‘Forbear, nor shriek thus, but vent joys as loud."
400,20,1737,"_It is no piety to bemoan the proud,_"
400,20,1738,"Though ends befall them moving ne’er so much,"
400,20,1739,These are the portions of the Gods to such.
400,20,1740,_Men’s own impieties in their instant act
400,20,1741,"Sustain their plagues, which are with stay but rackt._"
400,20,1742,"But these men Gods nor men had in esteem,"
400,20,1743,"Nor good nor bad had any sense in them,"
400,20,1744,"Their lives directly ill were, therefore, cause"
400,20,1745,That Death in these stern forms so deeply draws.
400,20,1746,"Recount, then, to me those licentious dames"
400,20,1747,That lost my honour and their sex’s shames.”
400,20,1748,"“I’ll tell you truly,” she replied: “There are"
400,20,1749,Twice five - and - twenty women here that share
400,20,1750,"All work amongst them; whom I taught to spin,"
400,20,1751,And bear the just bands that they suffer’d in.
400,20,1752,Of all which only there were twelve that gave
400,20,1753,"Themselves to impudence and light behave,"
400,20,1754,"Nor me respecting, nor herself — the Queen."
400,20,1755,And for your son he hath but lately been
400,20,1756,Of years to rule; nor would his mother bear
400,20,1757,"His empire where her women’s labours were,"
400,20,1758,But let me go and give her notice now
400,20,1759,Of your arrival. Sure some God doth show
400,20,1760,"His hand upon her in this rest she takes,"
400,20,1761,That all these uproars bears and never wakes.”
400,20,1762,"“Nor wake her yet,” said he, “but cause to come"
400,20,1763,Those twelve light women to this utter room.”
400,20,1764,"She made all utmost haste to come and go,"
400,20,1765,And bring the women he had summon’d so.
400,20,1766,Then both his swains and son he bade go call
400,20,1767,"The women to their aid, and clear the hall"
400,20,1768,"Of those dead bodies, cleanse each board and throne"
400,20,1769,"With wetted sponges. Which with fitness done,"
400,20,1770,He bade take all the strumpets ’twixt the wall
400,20,1771,"Of his first court and that room next the hall,"
400,20,1772,"In which the vessels of the house were scour’d,"
400,20,1773,"And in their bosoms sheath their ev’ry sword,"
400,20,1774,"Till all their souls were fled, and they had then"
400,20,1775,Felt ’twas but pain to sport with lawless men.
400,20,1776,"This said, the women came all drown’d in moan,"
400,20,1777,And weeping bitterly. But first was done
400,20,1778,The bearing thence the dead; all which beneath
400,20,1779,"The portico they stow’d, where death on death"
400,20,1780,They heap’d together. Then took all the pains
400,20,1781,Ulysses will’d. His son yet and the swains
400,20,1782,With paring - shovels wrought. The women bore
400,20,1783,"Their parings forth, and all the clotter’d gore."
400,20,1784,"The house then cleans’d, they brought the women out,"
400,20,1785,And put them in a room so wall’d about
400,20,1786,That no means serv’d their sad estates to fly.
400,20,1787,Then said Telemachus: “These shall not die
400,20,1788,"A death that lets out any wanton blood,"
400,20,1789,"And vents the poison that gave lust her food,"
400,20,1790,"The body cleansing, but a death that chokes"
400,20,1791,"The breath, and altogether that provokes"
400,20,1792,"And seems as bellows to abhorréd lust,"
400,20,1793,"That both on my head pour’d depraves unjust,"
400,20,1794,"And on my mother’s, scandalling the Court,"
400,20,1795,"With men debauch’d, in so abhorr’d a sort.”"
400,20,1796,"This said, a halser of a ship they cast"
400,20,1797,"About a cross - beam of the roof, which fast"
400,20,1798,"They made about their necks, in twelve parts cut,"
400,20,1799,And hal’d them up so high they could not put
400,20,1800,"Their feet to any stay. As which was done,"
400,20,1801,"Look how a mavis, or a pigeon,"
400,20,1802,"In any grove caught with a springe or net,"
400,20,1803,With struggling pinions ’gainst the ground doth beat
400,20,1804,"Her tender body, and that then strait bed"
400,20,1805,Is sour to that swing in which she was bred;
400,20,1806,"So striv’d these taken birds, till ev’ry one"
400,20,1807,Her pliant halter had enforc’d upon
400,20,1808,"Her stubborn neck, and then aloft was haul’d"
400,20,1809,"To wretched death. A little space they sprawl’d,"
400,20,1810,"Their feet fast moving, but were quickly still."
400,20,1811,"Then fetch’d they down Melanthius, to fulfill"
400,20,1812,The equal execution; which was done
400,20,1813,"In portal of the hall, and thus begun:"
400,20,1814,"They first slit both his nostrils, cropp’d each ear,"
400,20,1815,"His members tugg’d off, which the dogs did tear"
400,20,1816,"And chop up bleeding sweet; and, while red - hot"
400,20,1817,"The vice - abhorring blood was, off they smote"
400,20,1818,His hands and feet; and there that work had end.
400,20,1819,"Then wash’d they hands and feet that blood had stain’d,"
400,20,1820,And took the house again. And then the King
400,20,1821,"Euryclea calling, bade her quickly bring"
400,20,1822,"All - ill - expelling brimstone, and some fire,"
400,20,1823,That with perfumes cast he might make entire
400,20,1824,The house’s first integrity in all.
400,20,1825,"And then his timely will was, she should call"
400,20,1826,Her Queen and ladies; still yet charging her
400,20,1827,That all the handmaids she should first confer.
400,20,1828,"She said he spake as fitted; but, before,"
400,20,1829,"She held it fit to change the weeds he wore,"
400,20,1830,"And she would others bring him, that not so"
400,20,1831,"His fair broad shoulders might rest clad, and show"
400,20,1832,His person to his servants was to blame.
400,20,1833,"“First bring me fire,” said he. She went and came"
400,20,1834,With fire and sulphur straight; with which the hall
400,20,1835,And of the huge house all rooms capital
400,20,1836,He throughly sweeten’d. Then went nurse to call
400,20,1837,The handmaid servants down; and up she went
400,20,1838,"To tell the news, and will’d them to present"
400,20,1839,Their service to their sov’reign. Down they came
400,20,1840,"Sustaining torches all, and pour’d a flame"
400,20,1841,"Of love about their lord, with welcomes home,"
400,20,1842,"With huggings of his hands, with laboursome"
400,20,1843,"Both heads and foreheads kisses, and embraces,"
400,20,1844,And plied him so with all their loving graces
400,20,1845,That tears and sighs took up his whole desire;
400,20,1846,For now he knew their hearts to him entire.
400,20,1847,THE END OF THE TWENTY - SECOND BOOK OF HOMER’S ODYSSEYS.
400,20,1848,THE TWENTY - THIRD BOOK OF HOMER’S ODYSSEYS
400,20,1849,THE ARGUMENT
400,20,1850,Ulysses to his wife is known.
400,20,1851,A brief sum of his travels shown.
400,20,1852,"Himself, his son, and servants go"
400,20,1853,T’ approve the Wooers’ overthrow.
400,20,1854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,20,1855,_Ψι̑._
400,20,1856,For all annoys
400,20,1857,"Sustain’d before,"
400,20,1858,The true wife’s joys
400,20,1859,Now made the more.
400,20,1860,"The servants thus inform’d, the matron goes"
400,20,1861,"Up where the Queen was cast in such repose,"
400,20,1862,Affected with a fervent joy to tell
400,20,1863,What all this time she did with pain conceal.
400,20,1864,"Her knees revok’d their first strength, and her feet"
400,20,1865,Were borne above the ground with wings to greet
400,20,1866,The long - griev’d Queen with news her King was come;
400,20,1867,"And, near her, said: “Wake, leave this withdrawn room,"
400,20,1868,"That now your eyes may see at length, though late,"
400,20,1869,"The man return’d, which, all the heavy date"
400,20,1870,"Your woes have rack’d out, you have long’d to see."
400,20,1871,"Ulysses is come home, and hath set free"
400,20,1872,"His court of all your Wooers, slaught’ring all"
400,20,1873,"For wasting so his goods with festival,"
400,20,1874,"His house so vexing, and for violence done"
400,20,1875,So all ways varied to his only son.”
400,20,1876,"She answer’d her: “The Gods have made thee mad,"
400,20,1877,Of whose pow’r now thy pow’rs such proof have had.
400,20,1878,"The Gods can blind with follies wisest eyes,"
400,20,1879,And make men foolish so to make them wise.
400,20,1880,"For they have hurt ev’n thy grave brain, that bore"
400,20,1881,An understanding spirit heretofore.
400,20,1882,"Why hast thou wak’d me to more tears, when Moan"
400,20,1883,"Hath turn’d my mind, with tears into her own?"
400,20,1884,"Thy madness much more blameful, that with lies"
400,20,1885,"Thy haste is laden, and both robs mine eyes"
400,20,1886,"Of most delightsome sleep, and sleep of them,"
400,20,1887,"That now had bound me in his sweet extreme,"
400,20,1888,T’ embrace my lids and close my visual spheres:
400,20,1889,"I have not slept so much this twenty years,"
400,20,1890,Since first my dearest sleeping - mate was gone
400,20,1891,For that too - ill - to - speak - of Ilion.
400,20,1892,"Hence, take your mad steps back. If any maid"
400,20,1893,Of all my train besides a part had play’d
400,20,1894,"So bold to wake, and tell mine ears such lies,"
400,20,1895,I had return’d her to her housewif’ries
400,20,1896,With good proof of my wrath to such rude dames.
400,20,1897,"But go, your years have sav’d their younger blames.”"
400,20,1898,"She answer’d her: “I nothing wrong your ear,"
400,20,1899,"But tell the truth. Your long - miss’d lord is here,"
400,20,1900,"And, with the Wooers’ slaughter, his own hand,"
400,20,1901,"In chief exploit, hath to his own command"
400,20,1902,"Reduc’d his house; and that poor guest was he,"
400,20,1903,That all those Wooers wrought such injury.
400,20,1904,Telemachus had knowledge long ago
400,20,1905,"That ’twas his father, but his wisdom so"
400,20,1906,"Observ’d his counsels, to give surer end"
400,20,1907,To that great work to which they did contend.”
400,20,1908,This call’d her spirits to their conceiving places;
400,20,1909,She sprung for joy from blames into embraces
400,20,1910,"Of her grave nurse, wip’d ev’ry tear away"
400,20,1911,"From her fair cheeks, and then began to say"
400,20,1912,"What nurse said over thus: “O nurse, can this"
400,20,1913,Be true thou say’st? How could that hand of his
400,20,1914,Alone destroy so many? They would still
400,20,1915,Troop all together. How could he then kill
400,20,1916,"Such numbers so united?” “How,” said she,"
400,20,1917,“I have not seen nor heard; but certainly
400,20,1918,"The deed is done. We sat within in fear,"
400,20,1919,"The doors shut on us, and from thence might hear"
400,20,1920,"The sighs and groans of ev’ry man he slew,"
400,20,1921,"But heard nor saw more, till at length there flew"
400,20,1922,"Your son’s voice to mine ear, that call’d to me,"
400,20,1923,"And bade me then come forth, and then I see"
400,20,1924,Ulysses standing in the midst of all
400,20,1925,"Your slaughter’d Wooers, heap’d up, like a wall,"
400,20,1926,One on another round about his side.
400,20,1927,It would have done you good to have descried
400,20,1928,Your conqu’ring lord all - smear’d with blood and gore
400,20,1929,"So like a lion. Straight, then, off they bore"
400,20,1930,"The slaughter’d carcasses, that now before"
400,20,1931,"The fore - court gates lie, one on another pil’d."
400,20,1932,"And now your victor all the hall, defil’d"
400,20,1933,"With stench of hot death, is perfuming round,"
400,20,1934,And with a mighty fire the hearth hath crown’d.
400,20,1935,"“Thus, all the death remov’d, and ev’ry room"
400,20,1936,"Made sweet and sightly, that yourself should come"
400,20,1937,"His pleasure sent me. Come, then, take you now"
400,20,1938,Your mutual fills of comfort. Grief on you
400,20,1939,"Hath long and many suff’rings laid; which length,"
400,20,1940,"Which many suff’rings, now your virtuous strength"
400,20,1941,Of uncorrupted chasteness hath conferr’d
400,20,1942,A happy end to. He that long hath err’d
400,20,1943,"Is safe arriv’d at home; his wife, his son,"
400,20,1944,Found safe and good; all ill that hath been done
400,20,1945,"On all the doers’ heads, though long prolong’d,"
400,20,1946,"His right hath wreak’d, and in the place they wrong’d.”"
400,20,1947,She answer’d: “Do not you now laugh and boast
400,20,1948,"As you had done some great act, seeing most"
400,20,1949,Into his being; for you know he won —
400,20,1950,Ev’n through his poor and vile condition —
400,20,1951,A kind of prompted thought that there was plac’d
400,20,1952,Some virtue in him fit to be embrac’d
400,20,1953,"By all the house, but most of all by me,"
400,20,1954,And by my son that was the progeny
400,20,1955,"Of both our loves. And yet it is not he,"
400,20,1956,"For all the likely proofs ye plead to me, —"
400,20,1957,Some God hath slain the Wooers in disdain
400,20,1958,Of the abhorréd pride he saw so reign
400,20,1959,"In those base works they did. No man alive,"
400,20,1960,"Or good or bad, whoever did arrive"
400,20,1961,"At their abodes once, ever could obtain"
400,20,1962,Regard of them; and therefore their so vain
400,20,1963,And vile deserts have found as vile an end.
400,20,1964,"But, for Ulysses, never will extend"
400,20,1965,"His wish’d return to Greece, nor he yet lives.”"
400,20,1966,"“How strange a Queen are you,” said she, “that gives"
400,20,1967,"No truth your credit, that your husband, set"
400,20,1968,"Close in his house at fire, can purchase yet"
400,20,1969,"No faith of you, but that he still is far"
400,20,1970,From any home of his! Your wit’s at war
400,20,1971,"With all credulity ever! And yet now,"
400,20,1972,I’ll name a sign shall force belief from you:
400,20,1973,"I bath’d him lately, and beheld the scar"
400,20,1974,That still remains a mark too ocular
400,20,1975,To leave your heart yet blinded; and I then
400,20,1976,"Had run and told you, but his hand was fain"
400,20,1977,To close my lips from th’ acclamation
400,20,1978,"My heart was breathing, and his wisdom won"
400,20,1979,"My still retention, till he gave me leave"
400,20,1980,And charge to tell you this. Now then receive
400,20,1981,My life for gage of his return; which take
400,20,1982,"In any cruel fashion, if I make"
400,20,1983,"All this not clear to you.” “Lov’d nurse,” said she,"
400,20,1984,"“Though many things thou know’st, yet these things be"
400,20,1985,Veil’d in the counsels th’ uncreated Gods
400,20,1986,Have long time mask’d in; whose dark periods
400,20,1987,"’Tis hard for thee to see into. But come,"
400,20,1988,"Let’s see my son, the slain, and him by whom"
400,20,1989,"They had their slaughter.” This said, down they went;"
400,20,1990,"When, on the Queen’s part, divers thoughts were spent,"
400,20,1991,"If, all this giv’n no faith, she still should stand"
400,20,1992,"Aloof, and question more; or his hugg’d hand"
400,20,1993,And lovéd head she should at first assay
400,20,1994,With free - giv’n kisses. When her doubtful way
400,20,1995,"Had pass’d the stony pavement, she took seat"
400,20,1996,"Against her husband, in the opposite heat"
400,20,1997,The fire then cast upon the other wall.
400,20,1998,"Himself set by the column of the hall,"
400,20,1999,"His looks cast downwards, and expected still"
400,20,2000,When her incredulous and curious will
400,20,2001,"To shun ridiculous error, and the shame"
400,20,2002,"To kiss a husband that was not the same,"
400,20,2003,"Would down, and win enough faith from his sight."
400,20,2004,"She silent sat, and her perplexéd plight"
400,20,2005,Amaze encounter’d. Sometimes she stood clear
400,20,2006,He was her husband; sometimes the ill wear
400,20,2007,His person had put on transform’d him so
400,20,2008,That yet his stamp would hardly current go.
400,20,2009,"Her son, her strangeness seeing, blam’d her thus:"
400,20,2010,"“Mother, ungentle mother! tyrannous!"
400,20,2011,In this too - curious modesty you show.
400,20,2012,"Why sit you from my father, nor bestow"
400,20,2013,A word on me t’ enquire and clear such doubt
400,20,2014,As may perplex you? Found man ever out
400,20,2015,One other such a wife that could forbear
400,20,2016,"Her lov’d lord’s welcome home, when twenty year"
400,20,2017,In infinite suff’rance he had spent apart.
400,20,2018,_No flint so hard is as a woman’s heart.”_
400,20,2019,"“Son,” said she, “amaze contains my mind,"
400,20,2020,Nor can I speak and use the common kind
400,20,2021,"Of those enquiries, nor sustain to see"
400,20,2022,With opposite looks his count’nance. If this be
400,20,2023,"My true Ulysses now return’d, there are"
400,20,2024,Tokens betwixt us of more fitness far
400,20,2025,To give me argument he is my lord;
400,20,2026,And my assurance of him may afford
400,20,2027,My proofs of joy for him from all these eyes
400,20,2028,With more decorum than objéct their guise
400,20,2029,To public notice.” The much - suff’rer brake
400,20,2030,"In laughter out, and to his son said: “Take"
400,20,2031,"Your mother from the prease, that she may make"
400,20,2032,"Her own proofs of me, which perhaps may give"
400,20,2033,More cause to the acknowledgments that drive
400,20,2034,"Their show thus off. But now, because I go"
400,20,2035,"So poorly clad, she takes disdain to know"
400,20,2036,So loath’d a creature for her lovéd lord.
400,20,2037,"Let us consult, then, how we may accord"
400,20,2038,The town to our late action. Some one slain
400,20,2039,Hath made the all - left slaughterer of him fain
400,20,2040,To fly his friends and country; but our swords
400,20,2041,"Have slain a city’s most supportful lords,"
400,20,2042,"The chief peers of the kingdom, therefore see"
400,20,2043,You use wise means t’ uphold your victory.”
400,20,2044,"“See you to that, good father,” said the son,"
400,20,2045,“Whose counsels have the sov’reign glory won
400,20,2046,"From all men living. None will strive with you,"
400,20,2047,"But with unquestion’d girlands grace your brow,"
400,20,2048,To whom our whole alacrities we vow
400,20,2049,In free attendance. Nor shall our hands leave
400,20,2050,Your onsets needy of supplies to give
400,20,2051,All the effects that in our pow’rs can fall.”
400,20,2052,"“Then this,” said he, “to me seems capital"
400,20,2053,"Of all choice courses: Bathe we first, and then"
400,20,2054,Attire we freshly; all our maids and men
400,20,2055,Enjoining likewise to their best attire.
400,20,2056,"The sacred singer then let touch his lyre,"
400,20,2057,"And go before us all in graceful dance,"
400,20,2058,"That all without, to whose ears shall advance"
400,20,2059,"Our cheerful accents, or of travellers by,"
400,20,2060,"Or firm inhabitants, solemnity"
400,20,2061,Of frolic nuptials may imagine here.
400,20,2062,"And this perform we, lest the massacre"
400,20,2063,Of all our Wooers be divulg’d about
400,20,2064,"The ample city, ere ourselves get out"
400,20,2065,"And greet my father in his grove of trees,"
400,20,2066,"Where, after, we will prove what policies"
400,20,2067,Olympius shall suggest to overcome
400,20,2068,"Our latest toils, and crown our welcome home.”"
400,20,2069,"This all obey’d; bath’d, put on fresh attire"
400,20,2070,Both men and women did. Then took his lyre
400,20,2071,"The holy singer, and set thirst on fire"
400,20,2072,With songs and faultless dances; all the court
400,20,2073,Rung with the footings that the numerous sport
400,20,2074,From jocund men drew and fair - girdled dames;
400,20,2075,"Which heard abroad, thus flew the common fames:"
400,20,2076,“This sure the day is when the much - woo’d Queen
400,20,2077,Is richly wed. O wretch! That hath not been
400,20,2078,So constant as to keep her ample house
400,20,2079,Till th’ utmost hour had brought her foremost spouse.”
400,20,2080,"Thus some conceiv’d, but little knew the thing."
400,20,2081,"And now Eurynomé had bath’d the King,"
400,20,2082,"Smooth’d him with oils, and he himself attir’d"
400,20,2083,In vestures royal. Her part then inspir’d
400,20,2084,"The Goddess Pallas, deck’d his head and face"
400,20,2085,"With infinite beauties, gave a goodly grace"
400,20,2086,"Of stature to him, a much plumper plight"
400,20,2087,"Through all his body breath’d, curls soft and bright"
400,20,2088,"Adorn’d his head withal, and made it show"
400,20,2089,As if the flow’ry hyacinth did grow
400,20,2090,"In all his pride there, in the gen’ral trim"
400,20,2091,Of ev’ry lock and ev’ry curious limb.
400,20,2092,"Look how a skilful artizan, well - seen"
400,20,2093,"In all arts metalline, as having been"
400,20,2094,"Taught by Minerva and the God of fire,"
400,20,2095,Doth gold with silver mix so that entire
400,20,2096,"They keep their self - distinction, and yet so"
400,20,2097,That to the silver from the gold doth flow
400,20,2098,"A much more artificial lustre than his own,"
400,20,2099,And thereby to the gold itself is grown
400,20,2100,"A greater glory than if wrought alone,"
400,20,2101,Both being stuck off by either’s mixtion;
400,20,2102,"So did Minerva her’s and his combine,"
400,20,2103,"He more in her, she more in him, did shine."
400,20,2104,"Like an Immortal from the bath he rose,"
400,20,2105,"And to his wife did all his grace dispose,"
400,20,2106,Encount’ring this her strangeness: “Cruel dame
400,20,2107,"Of all that breathe, the Gods past steel and flame"
400,20,2108,Have made thee ruthless. Life retains not one
400,20,2109,Of all dames else that bears so overgrown
400,20,2110,"A mind with abstinence, as twenty years"
400,20,2111,"To miss her husband drown’d in woes and tears,"
400,20,2112,"And at his coming keep aloof, and fare"
400,20,2113,As of his so long absence and his care
400,20,2114,"No sense had seiz’d her. Go, nurse, make a bed,"
400,20,2115,That I alone may sleep; her heart is dead
400,20,2116,To all reflection!” To him thus replied
400,20,2117,"The wise Penelope: “Man half - deified,"
400,20,2118,’Tis not my fashion to be taken straight
400,20,2119,"With bravest men, nor poorest use to sleight."
400,20,2120,"Your mean appearance made not me retire,"
400,20,2121,"Nor this your rich show makes me now admire,"
400,20,2122,Nor moves at all; for what is all to me
400,20,2123,If not my husband? All his certainty
400,20,2124,"I knew at parting; but, so long apart,"
400,20,2125,The outward likeness holds no full desert
400,20,2126,"For me to trust to. Go, nurse, see addrest"
400,20,2127,"A soft bed for him, and the single rest"
400,20,2128,Himself affects so. Let it be the bed
400,20,2129,"That stands within our bridal chamber - sted,"
400,20,2130,"Which he himself made. Bring it forth from thence,"
400,20,2131,And see it furnish’d with magnificence.”
400,20,2132,"This said she to assay him, and did stir"
400,20,2133,Ev’n his establish’d patience; and to her
400,20,2134,Whom thus he answer’d: “Woman! your words prove
400,20,2135,My patience strangely. Who is it can move
400,20,2136,My bed out of his place? It shall oppress
400,20,2137,"Earth’s greatest understander; and, unless"
400,20,2138,"Ev’n God himself come, that can eas’ly grace"
400,20,2139,"Men in their most skills, it shall hold his place;"
400,20,2140,"For man he lives not that (as not most skill’d,"
400,20,2141,"So not most young) shall easily make it yield,"
400,20,2142,"If, building on the strength in which he flows,"
400,20,2143,He adds both levers too and iron crows:
400,20,2144,For in the fixture of the bed is shown
400,20,2145,"A master - piece, a wonder; and ’twas done"
400,20,2146,"By me, and none but me, and thus was wrought:"
400,20,2147,There was an olive - tree that had his grought
400,20,2148,"Amidst a hedge, and was of shadow proud,"
400,20,2149,"Fresh, and the prime age of his verdure show’d,"
400,20,2150,His leaves and arms so thick that to the eye
400,20,2151,It show’d a column for solidity.
400,20,2152,To this had I a comprehension
400,20,2153,"To build my bridal bow’r; which all of stone,"
400,20,2154,"Thick as the tree of leaves, I rais’d, and cast"
400,20,2155,"A roof about it nothing meanly grac’d,"
400,20,2156,"Put glued doors to it, that op’d art enough,"
400,20,2157,Then from the olive ev’ry broad - leav’d bough
400,20,2158,I lopp’d away; then fell’d the tree; and then
400,20,2159,"Went over it both with my axe and plane,"
400,20,2160,"Both govern’d by my line, And then I hew’d"
400,20,2161,My curious bedstead out; in which I shew’d
400,20,2162,"Work of no common hand. All this begun,"
400,20,2163,I could not leave till to perfection
400,20,2164,"My pains had brought it; took my wimble, bor’d"
400,20,2165,"The holes, as fitted, and did last afford"
400,20,2166,"The varied ornament, which show’d no want"
400,20,2167,"Of silver, gold, and polish’d elephant."
400,20,2168,An ox - hide dyed in purple then I threw
400,20,2169,Above the cords. And thus to curious view
400,20,2170,I hope I have objected honest sign
400,20,2171,To prove I author nought that is not mine.
400,20,2172,"But if my bed stand unremov’d or no,"
400,20,2173,"O woman, passeth human wit to know.”"
400,20,2174,"This sunk her knees and heart, to hear so true"
400,20,2175,The signs she urg’d; and first did tears ensue
400,20,2176,Her rapt assurance; then she ran and spread
400,20,2177,"Her arms about his neck, kiss’d oft his head,"
400,20,2178,And thus the curious stay she made excus’d:
400,20,2179,“Ulysses! Be not angry that I us’d
400,20,2180,"Such strange delays to this, since heretofore"
400,20,2181,Your suff’ring wisdom hath the garland wore
400,20,2182,"From all that breathe; and ’tis the Gods that, thus"
400,20,2183,"With mutual miss so long afflicting us,"
400,20,2184,Have caus’d my coyness; to our youths envied
400,20,2185,That wish’d society that should have tied
400,20,2186,Our youths and years together; and since now
400,20,2187,Judgment and Duty should our age allow
400,20,2188,"As full joys therein as in youth and blood,"
400,20,2189,See all young anger and reproof withstood
400,20,2190,"For not at first sight giving up my arms,"
400,20,2191,My heart still trembling lest the false alarms
400,20,2192,That words oft strike - up should ridiculize me.
400,20,2193,Had Argive Helen known credulity
400,20,2194,"Would bring such plagues with it, and her again,"
400,20,2195,"As authoress of them all, with that foul stain"
400,20,2196,"To her and to her country, she had stay’d"
400,20,2197,Her love and mixture from a stranger’s bed;
400,20,2198,"But God impell’d her to a shameless deed,"
400,20,2199,"Because she had not in herself decreed,"
400,20,2200,"Before th’ attempt, that such acts still were shent"
400,20,2201,As simply in themselves as in th’ event
400,20,2202,"By which not only she herself sustains,"
400,20,2203,"But we, for her fault, have paid mutual pains."
400,20,2204,"Yet now, since these signs of our certain bed"
400,20,2205,"You have discover’d, and distinguishéd"
400,20,2206,"From all earth’s others, no one man but you"
400,20,2207,"Yet ever getting of it th’ only show,"
400,20,2208,Nor one of all dames but myself and she
400,20,2209,"My father gave, old Actor’s progeny,"
400,20,2210,Who ever guarded to ourselves the door
400,20,2211,"Of that thick - shaded chamber, I no more"
400,20,2212,"Will cross your clear persuasion, though till now"
400,20,2213,"I stood too doubtful and austere to you,”"
400,20,2214,"These words of hers, so justifying her stay,"
400,20,2215,Did more desire of joyful moan convey
400,20,2216,To his glad mind than if at instant sight
400,20,2217,She had allow’d him all his wishes’ right.
400,20,2218,"He wept for joy, t’ enjoy a wife so fit"
400,20,2219,"For his grave mind, that knew his depth of wit,"
400,20,2220,"And held chaste virtue at a price so high,"
400,20,2221,"And as sad men at sea when shore is nigh,"
400,20,2222,"Which long their hearts have wish’d, their ship quite lost"
400,20,2223,"By Neptune’s rigour, and they vex’d and tost"
400,20,2224,"’Twixt winds and black waves, swimming for their lives,"
400,20,2225,"A few escap’d, and that few that survives,"
400,20,2226,"All drench’d in foam and brine, crawl up to land,"
400,20,2227,With joy as much as they did worlds command;
400,20,2228,"So dear to this wife was her husband’s sight,"
400,20,2229,"Who still embrac’d his neck, and had, till light"
400,20,2230,"Display’d her silver ensign, if the Dame,"
400,20,2231,That bears the blue sky intermix’d with flame
400,20,2232,"In her fair eyes, had not infix’d her thought"
400,20,2233,"On other joys, for loves so hardly brought"
400,20,2234,To long’d - for meeting; who th’ extended night
400,20,2235,"Withheld in long date, nor would let the light"
400,20,2236,"Her wing - hoov’d horse join — Lampus, Phaeton —"
400,20,2237,Those ever - colts that bring the morning on
400,20,2238,"To worldly men, but, in her golden chair,"
400,20,2239,Down to the ocean by her silver hair
400,20,2240,Bound her aspirings. Then Ulysses said:
400,20,2241,“O wife! Nor yet are my contentions stay’d.
400,20,2242,A most unmeasur’d labour long and hard
400,20,2243,Asks more performance; to it being prepar’d
400,20,2244,"By grave Tiresiás, when down to hell"
400,20,2245,"I made dark passage, that his skill might tell"
400,20,2246,"My men’s return and mine. But come, and now"
400,20,2247,Enjoy the sweet rest that our Fates allow.”
400,20,2248,"“The place of rest is ready,” she replied,"
400,20,2249,"“Your will at full serve, since the Deified"
400,20,2250,Have brought you where your right is to command.
400,20,2251,"But since you know, God making understand"
400,20,2252,"Your searching mind, inform me what must be"
400,20,2253,"Your last set labour; since ’twill fall to me,"
400,20,2254,"I hope, to hear it after, tell me now."
400,20,2255,_The greatest pleasure is before to know.”_
400,20,2256,“Unhappy!” said Ulysses; “To what end
400,20,2257,Importune you this labour? It will lend
400,20,2258,"Nor you nor me delight, but you shall know"
400,20,2259,I was commanded yet more to bestow
400,20,2260,"My years in travel, many cities more"
400,20,2261,By sea to visit; and when first for shore
400,20,2262,"I left my shipping, I was will’d to take"
400,20,2263,"A naval oar in hand, and with it make"
400,20,2264,My passage forth till such strange men I met
400,20,2265,"As knew no sea, nor ever salt did eat"
400,20,2266,"With any victuals, who the purple beaks"
400,20,2267,"Of ships did never see, nor that which breaks"
400,20,2268,"The waves in curls, which is a fan - like oar,"
400,20,2269,And serves as wings with which a ship doth soar.
400,20,2270,"To let me know, then, when I was arriv’d"
400,20,2271,"On that strange earth where such a people liv’d,"
400,20,2272,He gave me this for an unfailing sign:
400,20,2273,"When any one that took that oar of mine,"
400,20,2274,"Borne on my shoulder, for a corn - cleanse fan,"
400,20,2275,"I met ashore, and show’d to be a man"
400,20,2276,"Of that land’s labour, there had I command"
400,20,2277,"To fix mine oar, and offer on that strand"
400,20,2278,"T’ imperial Neptune, whom I must implore,"
400,20,2279,"A lamb, a bull, and sow - ascending boar;"
400,20,2280,"And then turn home, where all the other Gods"
400,20,2281,That in the broad heav’n made secure abodes
400,20,2282,I must solicit — all my curious heed
400,20,2283,Giv’n to the sev’ral rites they have decreed —
400,20,2284,"With holy hecatombs; and then, at home,"
400,20,2285,A gentle death should seize me that would come
400,20,2286,"From out the sea, and take me to his rest"
400,20,2287,"In full ripe age, about me living blest"
400,20,2288,"My loving people; to which, he presag’d,"
400,20,2289,The sequel of my fortunes were engag’d.”
400,20,2290,"“If then,” said she, “the Gods will please t’ impose"
400,20,2291,A happier being to your fortune’s close
400,20,2292,"Than went before, your hope gives comfort strength"
400,20,2293,That life shall lend you better days at length.”
400,20,2294,"While this discourse spent mutual speech, the bed"
400,20,2295,"Eurynomé and nurse had made, and spread"
400,20,2296,"With richest furniture, while torches spent"
400,20,2297,Their parcel - gilt thereon. To bed then went
400,20,2298,"The aged nurse; and, where their sov’reigns were,"
400,20,2299,"Eurynomé, the chambermaid, did bear"
400,20,2300,"A torch, and went before them to their rest;"
400,20,2301,To which she left them and for her’s addrest.
400,20,2302,"The King and Queen then now, as newly - wed,"
400,20,2303,Resum’d the old laws of th’ embracing bed.
400,20,2304,Telemachus and both his herdsmen then
400,20,2305,Dissolv’d the dances both to maids and men;
400,20,2306,Who in their shady roofs took timely sleep.
400,20,2307,The bride and bridegroom having ceas’d to keep
400,20,2308,"Observéd love - joys, from their fit delight"
400,20,2309,They turn’d to talk. The Queen then did recite
400,20,2310,What she had suffer’d by the hateful rout
400,20,2311,"Of harmful Wooers, who had eat her out"
400,20,2312,"So many oxen and so many sheep,"
400,20,2313,How many tun of wine their drinking deep
400,20,2314,Had quite exhausted. Great Ulysses then
400,20,2315,"Whatever slaughters he had made of men,"
400,20,2316,"Whatever sorrows he himself sustain’d,"
400,20,2317,Repeated amply; and her ears remain’d
400,20,2318,"With all delight attentive to their end,"
400,20,2319,"Nor would one wink sleep till he told her all,"
400,20,2320,Beginning where he gave the Cicons fall;
400,20,2321,From thence his pass to the Lotophagi;
400,20,2322,"The Cyclop’s acts, the putting out his eye,"
400,20,2323,"And wreak of all the soldiers he had eat,"
400,20,2324,No least ruth shown to all they could entreat;
400,20,2325,His way to Æolus; his prompt receit
400,20,2326,And kind dismission; his enforc’d retreat
400,20,2327,"By sudden tempest to the fishy main,"
400,20,2328,And quite distraction from his course again;
400,20,2329,"His landing at the Læstrigonian port,"
400,20,2330,Where ships and men in miserable sort
400,20,2331,"Met all their spoils, his ship and he alone"
400,20,2332,Got off from the abhorr’d confusión;
400,20,2333,"His pass to Circe, her deceits and arts;"
400,20,2334,His thence descension to th’ Infernal parts;
400,20,2335,"His life’s course of the Theban prophet learn’d,"
400,20,2336,"Where all the slaughter’d Grecians he discern’d,"
400,20,2337,And lovéd mother; his astonish’d ear
400,20,2338,With what the Siren’s voices made him hear;
400,20,2339,"His ’scape from th’ erring rocks, which Scylla was,"
400,20,2340,"And rough Charybdis, with the dang’rous pass"
400,20,2341,Of all that touch’d there; his Sicilian
400,20,2342,Offence giv’n to the Sun; his ev’ry man
400,20,2343,"Destroy’d by thunder vollied out of heav’n,"
400,20,2344,That split his ship; his own endeavours driv’n
400,20,2345,"To shift for succours on th’ Ogygian shore,"
400,20,2346,Where Nymph Calypso such affection bore
400,20,2347,"To him in his arrival, that with feast"
400,20,2348,"She kept him in her caves, and would have blest"
400,20,2349,His welcome life with an immortal state
400,20,2350,"Would he have stay’d and liv’d her nuptial mate,"
400,20,2351,All which she never could persuade him to;
400,20,2352,His pass to the Phæacians spent in woe;
400,20,2353,"Their hearty welcome of him, as he were"
400,20,2354,A God descended from the starry sphere;
400,20,2355,"Their kind dismission of him home with gold,"
400,20,2356,"Brass, garments, all things his occasions would."
400,20,2357,"This last word us’d, sleep seiz’d his weary eye"
400,20,2358,That salves all care to all mortality.
400,20,2359,In mean space Pallas entertain’d intent
400,20,2360,That when Ulysses thought enough time spent
400,20,2361,"In love - joys with his wife, to raise the day,"
400,20,2362,And make his grave occasions call away.
400,20,2363,"The morning rose and he, when thus he said:"
400,20,2364,"“O Queen, now satiate with afflictions laid"
400,20,2365,"On both our bosoms, — you oppresséd here"
400,20,2366,"With cares for my return, I ev’rywhere"
400,20,2367,By Jove and all the other Deities tost
400,20,2368,"Ev’n till all hope of my return was lost, —"
400,20,2369,"And both arriv’d at this sweet haven, our bed,"
400,20,2370,Be your care us’d to see administ’red
400,20,2371,"My house - possessions left. Those sheep, that were"
400,20,2372,"Consum’d in surfeits by your Wooers here,"
400,20,2373,I’ll forage to supply with some; and more
400,20,2374,"The suff’ring Grecians shall be made restore,"
400,20,2375,Ev’n till our stalls receive their wonted fill.
400,20,2376,"“And now, to comfort my good father’s ill"
400,20,2377,"Long suffer’d for me, to the many - tree’d"
400,20,2378,And ample vineyard grounds it is decreed
400,20,2379,In my next care that I must haste and see
400,20,2380,"His long’d - for presence. In the mean time, be"
400,20,2381,"Your wisdom us’d, that since, the sun ascended,"
400,20,2382,The fame will soon be through the town extended
400,20,2383,"Of those I here have slain, yourself, got close"
400,20,2384,"Up to your chamber, see you there repose,"
400,20,2385,"Cheer’d with your women, and nor look afford"
400,20,2386,"Without your court, nor any man a word.”"
400,20,2387,"This said, he arm’d; to arms both son and swain"
400,20,2388,"His pow’r commanding, who did entertain"
400,20,2389,"His charge with spirit, op’d the gates and out,"
400,20,2390,He leading all. And now was hurl’d about
400,20,2391,Aurora’s ruddy fire; through all whose light
400,20,2392,Minerva led them through the town from sight.
400,20,2393,THE END OF THE TWENTY - THIRD BOOK OF HOMER’S ODYSSEYS.
400,20,2394,THE TWENTY - FOURTH BOOK OF HOMER’S ODYSSEYS
400,20,2395,THE ARGUMENT
400,20,2396,By Mercury the Wooers’ souls
400,20,2397,Are usher’d to th’ infernal pools.
400,20,2398,"Ulysses with Laertes met,"
400,20,2399,The people are in uproar set
400,20,2400,"Against them, for the Wooers’ ends;"
400,20,2401,Whom Pallas stays and renders friends.
400,20,2402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
400,20,2403,_Ω._
400,20,2404,"The uproar’s fire,"
400,20,2405,The people’s fall:
400,20,2406,"The grandsire, sire,"
400,20,2407,"And son, to all."
400,20,2408,"Cyllenian Hermes, with his golden rod,"
400,20,2409,"The Wooers’ souls, that yet retain’d abode"
400,20,2410,"Amidst their bodies, call’d in dreadful rout"
400,20,2411,Forth to th’ Infernals; who came murmuring out.
400,20,2412,And as amidst the desolate retreat
400,20,2413,"Of some vast cavern, made the sacred seat"
400,20,2414,"Of austere spirits, bats with breasts and wings"
400,20,2415,"Clasp fast the walls, and each to other clings,"
400,20,2416,"But, swept off from their coverts, up they rise"
400,20,2417,And fly with murmurs in amazeful guise
400,20,2418,"About the cavern; so these, grumbling, rose"
400,20,2419,And flock’d together. Down before them goes
400,20,2420,"None - hurting Mercury to Hell’s broad ways,"
400,20,2421,And straight to those straits; where the ocean stays
400,20,2422,"His lofty current in calm deeps, they flew,"
400,20,2423,"Then to the snowy rock they next withdrew,"
400,20,2424,"And to the close of Phœbus’ orient gates,"
400,20,2425,"The nation then of dreams, and then the states"
400,20,2426,Of those souls’ idols that the weary dead
400,20,2427,"Gave up in earth, which in a flow’ry mead"
400,20,2428,Had habitable situatión.
400,20,2429,"And there they saw the soul of Thetis’ son,"
400,20,2430,"Of good Patroclus, brave Antilochus,"
400,20,2431,"And Ajax, the supremely strenuous"
400,20,2432,Of all the Greek host next Pelëion;
400,20,2433,All which assembled about Maia’s son.
400,20,2434,"And to them, after, came the mournful ghost"
400,20,2435,"Of Agamemnon, with all those he lost"
400,20,2436,In false Ægisthus’ court. Achilles then
400,20,2437,"Beholding there that mighty king of men,"
400,20,2438,"Deplor’d his plight, and said: “O Atreus’ son!"
400,20,2439,"Of all heroës, all opinion"
400,20,2440,"Gave thee for Jove’s most lov’d, since most command"
400,20,2441,Of all the Greeks he gave thy eminent hand
400,20,2442,"At siege of Ilion, where we suffer’d so."
400,20,2443,"And is the issue this, that first in woe"
400,20,2444,Stern Fate did therefore set thy sequel down?
400,20,2445,_None borne past others’ Fates can pass his own._
400,20,2446,I wish to heav’n that in the height of all
400,20,2447,"Our pomp at Ilion Fate had sign’d thy fall,"
400,20,2448,That all the Greeks might have advanc’d to thee
400,20,2449,"A famous sepulchre, and Fame might see"
400,20,2450,Thy son giv’n honour in thy honour’d end!
400,20,2451,But now a wretched death did Fate extend
400,20,2452,To thy confusion and thy issue’s shame.”
400,20,2453,"“O Thetis’ son,” said he, “the vital flame"
400,20,2454,"Extinct at Ilion, far from th’ Argive fields,"
400,20,2455,The style of Blessed to thy virtue yields.
400,20,2456,About thy fall the best of Greece and Troy
400,20,2457,Were sacrific’d to slaughter. Thy just joy
400,20,2458,Conceiv’d in battle with some worth forgot
400,20,2459,In such a death as great Apollo shot
400,20,2460,At thy encounters. Thy brave person lay
400,20,2461,"Hid in a dusty whirlwind, that made way"
400,20,2462,With human breaths spent in thy ruin’s state
400,20,2463,"Thou, great, wert greatly valued in thy fate."
400,20,2464,All day we fought about thee; nor at all
400,20,2465,"Had ceas’d our conflict, had not Jove let fall"
400,20,2466,A storm that forc’d off our unwilling feet.
400,20,2467,"But, having brought thee from the fight to fleet,"
400,20,2468,"Thy glorious person, bath’d and balm’d, we laid"
400,20,2469,Aloft a bed; and round about thee paid
400,20,2470,"The Greeks warm tears to thy deplor’d decease,"
400,20,2471,"Quite daunted, cutting all their curls’ increase."
400,20,2472,Thy death drave a divine voice through the seas
400,20,2473,That started up thy mother from the waves;
400,20,2474,"And all the márine Godheads left their caves,"
400,20,2475,Consorting to our fleet her rapt repair.
400,20,2476,The Greeks stood frighted to see sea and air
400,20,2477,"And earth combine so in thy loss’s sense,"
400,20,2478,"Had taken ship and fled for ever thence,"
400,20,2479,If old much - knowing - Nestor had not stay’d
400,20,2480,Their rushing off; his counsels having sway’d
400,20,2481,In all times former with such cause their courses;
400,20,2482,"Who bade contain themselves, and trust their forces,"
400,20,2483,"For all they saw was Thetis come from sea,"
400,20,2484,"With others of the wat’ry progeny,"
400,20,2485,To see and mourn for her deceaséd son.
400,20,2486,Which stay’d the fears that all to flight had won;
400,20,2487,And round about thee stood th’ old sea - God’s Seeds
400,20,2488,"Wretchedly mourning, their immortal weeds"
400,20,2489,Spreading upon thee. All the sacred Nine
400,20,2490,"Of deathless Muses paid thee dues divine,"
400,20,2491,"By varied turns their heav’nly voices venting,"
400,20,2492,All in deep passion for thy death consenting.
400,20,2493,And then of all our army not an eye
400,20,2494,"You could have seen undrown’d in misery,"
400,20,2495,The moving Muse so rul’d in ev’ry mind.
400,20,2496,Full seventeen days and nights our tears confin’d
400,20,2497,To celebration of thy mournéd end;
400,20,2498,Both men and Gods did in thy moan contend.
400,20,2499,The eighteenth day we spent about thy heap
400,20,2500,"Of dying fire. Black oxen, fattest sheep"
400,20,2501,"We slew past number. Then the precious spoil,"
400,20,2502,"Thy corse, we took up, which with floods of oil"
400,20,2503,"And pleasant honey we embalm’d, and then"
400,20,2504,Wrapp’d thee in those robes that the Gods did rain.
400,20,2505,In which we gave thee to the hallow’d flame;
400,20,2506,"To which a number of heroical name,"
400,20,2507,As prest to sacrifice their vital right
400,20,2508,To thy dead ruins while so bright they burn’d.
400,20,2509,"Both foot and horse brake in, and fought and mourn’d"
400,20,2510,In infinite tumult. But when all the night
400,20,2511,"The rich flame lasted, and that wasted quite"
400,20,2512,Thy body was with the enamour’d fire:
400,20,2513,"We came in early morn, and an entire"
400,20,2514,Collection made of ev’ry ivory bone;
400,20,2515,"Which wash’d in wine, and giv’n fit unctión,"
400,20,2516,"A two - ear’d bowl of gold thy mother gave,"
400,20,2517,By Bacchus giv’n her and did form receive
400,20,2518,"From Vulcan’s famous hand, which, O renown’d"
400,20,2519,"Great Thetis’ son, with thy fair bones we crown’d"
400,20,2520,Mix’d with the bones of Menœtiades
400,20,2521,"And brave Antilochus; who, in decease"
400,20,2522,"Of thy Patroclus, was thy favour’s dear."
400,20,2523,About thee then a matchless sepulchre
400,20,2524,The sacred host of the Achaians rais’d
400,20,2525,"Upon the Hellespont, where most it seiz’d,"
400,20,2526,"For height and conspicuity, the eyes"
400,20,2527,Of living men and their posterities.
400,20,2528,Thy mother then obtain’d the Gods’ consent
400,20,2529,"To institute an honour’d game, that spent"
400,20,2530,The best approvement of our Grecian fames.
400,20,2531,In whose praise I must say that many games
400,20,2532,About heroës’ sepulchres mine eyes
400,20,2533,"Have seen perform’d, but these bore off the prize"
400,20,2534,With miracles to me from all before.
400,20,2535,In which thy silver - footed mother bore
400,20,2536,"The institution’s name, but thy deserts,"
400,20,2537,"Being great with heav’n, caus’d all the eminent parts."
400,20,2538,"And thus, through all the worst effects of Fate,"
400,20,2539,Achilles’ fame ev’n Death shall propagate.
400,20,2540,While anyone shall lend the light an eye
400,20,2541,Divine Æacides shall never die.
400,20,2542,But wherein can these comforts be conceiv’d
400,20,2543,"As rights to me? When, having quite achiev’d"
400,20,2544,"An end with safety, and with conquest, too,"
400,20,2545,"Of so unmatch’d a war, what none could do"
400,20,2546,"Of all our enemies there, at home a friend"
400,20,2547,And wife have giv’n me inglorious end?”
400,20,2548,"While these thus spake, the Argus - killing spy"
400,20,2549,Brought - near Ulysses’ noble victory
400,20,2550,"To their renew’d discourse, in all the ends"
400,20,2551,"The Wooers’ suffer’d, and show’d those his friends;"
400,20,2552,Whom now amaze invaded with the view
400,20,2553,And made give back; yet Agamemnon knew
400,20,2554,"Melanthius’ heir, much - fam’d Amphimedon,"
400,20,2555,Who had in Ithaca guest - favours shown
400,20,2556,"To great Atrides; who first spake, and said:"
400,20,2557,“Amphimedon! What suff’rance hath been laid
400,20,2558,On your alive parts that hath made you make
400,20,2559,"This land of darkness the retreat you take,"
400,20,2560,"So all together, all being like in years,"
400,20,2561,"Nor would a man have choos’d, of all the peers"
400,20,2562,"A city honours, men to make a part"
400,20,2563,More strong for any object? Hath your smart
400,20,2564,"Been felt from Neptune, being at sea — his wrath"
400,20,2565,The winds and waves exciting to your scathe?
400,20,2566,Or have offensive men impos’d this fate —
400,20,2567,"Your oxen driving, or your flock’s estate?"
400,20,2568,"Or for your city fighting and your wives,"
400,20,2569,Have deaths untimely seiz’d your best - tim’d lives?
400,20,2570,"Inform me truly. I was once your guest,"
400,20,2571,When I and Menelaus had profest
400,20,2572,"First arms for Ilion, and were come ashore"
400,20,2573,"On Ithaca, with purpose to implore"
400,20,2574,"Ulysses’ aid, that city - racing man,"
400,20,2575,In wreak of the adult’rous Phrygian.
400,20,2576,Retain not you the time? A whole month’s date
400,20,2577,"We spent at sea, in hope to instigate"
400,20,2578,"In our arrival old Laertes’ son,"
400,20,2579,"Whom, hardly yet, to our design we won.”"
400,20,2580,"The soul made answer: “Worthiest king of men,"
400,20,2581,I well remember ev’ry passage then
400,20,2582,"You now reduce to thought, and will relate"
400,20,2583,The truth in whole form of our timeless fate:
400,20,2584,"“We woo’d the wife of that long - absent king,"
400,20,2585,Who (though her second marriage were a thing
400,20,2586,Of most hate to her) she would yet deny
400,20,2587,"At no part our affections, nor comply"
400,20,2588,"With any in performance, but decreed,"
400,20,2589,"In her delays, the cruel Fates we feed."
400,20,2590,Her craft was this: She undertook to weave
400,20,2591,A funeral garment destin’d to receive
400,20,2592,The corse of old Laertes; being a task
400,20,2593,"Of infinite labour, and which time would ask."
400,20,2594,In midst of whose attempt she caus’d our stay
400,20,2595,"With this attraction: ‘Youths, that come in way"
400,20,2596,"Of honour’d nuptials to me, though my lord"
400,20,2597,"Abide amongst the dead, yet cease to board"
400,20,2598,"My choice for present nuptials, and sustain,"
400,20,2599,"Lest what is past me of this web be vain,"
400,20,2600,Till all receive perfection. ’Tis a weed
400,20,2601,Dispos’d to wrap in at his funeral need
400,20,2602,"The old Laertes; who, possessing much,"
400,20,2603,"Would, in his want of rites as fitting, touch"
400,20,2604,My honour highly with each vulgar dame.’
400,20,2605,"Thus spake she, and persuaded; and her frame"
400,20,2606,"All - day she labour’d, her day’s work not small,"
400,20,2607,But ev’ry night - time she unwrought it all.
400,20,2608,Three years continuing this imperfect task;
400,20,2609,But when the fourth year came her sleights could mask
400,20,2610,"In no more covert, since her trusted maid"
400,20,2611,Her whole deceit to our true note betray’d.
400,20,2612,"With which surpriz’d, she could no more protract"
400,20,2613,"Her work’s perfection, but gave end exact"
400,20,2614,"To what remain’d, wash’d - up, and set thereon"
400,20,2615,A gloss so bright that like the sun and moon
400,20,2616,The whole work show’d together. And when now
400,20,2617,Of mere necessity her honour’d vow
400,20,2618,"She must make good to us, ill - fortune brought"
400,20,2619,"Ulysses home, who yet gave none one thought"
400,20,2620,"Of his arrival, but far - off at field"
400,20,2621,"Liv’d with his herdsman, nor his trust would yield"
400,20,2622,"Note of his person, but liv’d there as guest,"
400,20,2623,Ragg’d as a beggar in that life profest.
400,20,2624,"At length Telemachus left Pylos’ sand,"
400,20,2625,"And with a ship fetch’d soon his native land,"
400,20,2626,"When yet not home he went, but laid his way"
400,20,2627,Up to his herdsman where his father lay;
400,20,2628,And where both laid our deaths. To town then bore
400,20,2629,"The swine - herd and his King, the swain before,"
400,20,2630,Telemachus in other ways bestow’d
400,20,2631,"His course home first, t’ associate us that woo’d."
400,20,2632,"The swain the King led after, who came on"
400,20,2633,"Raggéd and wretched, and still lean’d upon"
400,20,2634,"A borrow’d staff. At length he reach’d his home,"
400,20,2635,Where (on the sudden and so wretched come)
400,20,2636,Nor we nor much our elders once did dream
400,20,2637,"Of his return there, but did wrongs extreme"
400,20,2638,Of words and blows to him; all which he bore
400,20,2639,With that old patience he had learn’d before.
400,20,2640,"But when the mind of Jove had rais’d his own,"
400,20,2641,"His son and he fetch’d all their armour down,"
400,20,2642,"Fast - lock’d the doors, and, to prepare their use,"
400,20,2643,"He will’d his wife, for first mean, to produce"
400,20,2644,His bow to us to draw; of which no one
400,20,2645,Could stir the string; himself yet set upon
400,20,2646,"The deadly strength it held, drew all with ease,"
400,20,2647,"Shot through the steels, and then began to seize"
400,20,2648,Our armless bosoms; striking first the breast
400,20,2649,"Of king Antinous, and then the rest"
400,20,2650,In heaps turn’d over; hopeful of his end
400,20,2651,"Because some God, he knew, stood firm his friend."
400,20,2652,"Nor prov’d it worse with him, but all in flood"
400,20,2653,The pavement straight blush’d with our vital blood.
400,20,2654,And thus our souls came here; our bodies laid
400,20,2655,"Neglected in his roofs, no word convey’d"
400,20,2656,To any friend to take us home and give
400,20,2657,"Our wounds fit balming, nor let such as live"
400,20,2658,"Entomb our deaths, and for our fortunes shed"
400,20,2659,Those tears and dead - rites that renown the dead.”
400,20,2660,Atrides’ ghost gave answer: “O bless’d son
400,20,2661,"Of old Laertes, thou at length hast won"
400,20,2662,With mighty virtue thy unmatchéd wife.
400,20,2663,"How good a knowledge, how untouch’d a life,"
400,20,2664,Hath wise Penelope! How well she laid
400,20,2665,"Her husband’s rights up, whom she lov’d a maid!"
400,20,2666,"For which her virtues shall extend applause,"
400,20,2667,Beyond the circles frail mortality draws;
400,20,2668,The deathless in this vale of death comprising
400,20,2669,Her praise in numbers into infinites rising.
400,20,2670,The daughter Tyndarus begat begot
400,20,2671,"No such chaste thoughts, but cut the virgin knot"
400,20,2672,That knit her spouse and her with murd’rous swords.
400,20,2673,For which posterities shall put hateful words
400,20,2674,"To notes of her that all her sex defam’d,"
400,20,2675,And for her ill shall ev’n the good be blam’d.”
400,20,2676,To this effect these these digressions made
400,20,2677,"In hell, earth’s dark and ever - hiding shade."
400,20,2678,"Ulysses and his son, now past the town,"
400,20,2679,Soon reach’d the field elaborately grown
400,20,2680,"By old Laertes’ labour, when, with cares"
400,20,2681,"For his lost son, he left all court affairs,"
400,20,2682,And took to this rude upland; which with toil
400,20,2683,He made a sweet and habitable soil;
400,20,2684,"Where stood a house to him; about which ran,"
400,20,2685,"In turnings thick and labyrinthian,"
400,20,2686,"Poor hovels, where his necessary men"
400,20,2687,That did those works (of pleasure to him then)
400,20,2688,"Might sit, and eat, and sleep. In his own house"
400,20,2689,"An old Sicilian dame liv’d, studious"
400,20,2690,To serve his sour age with her cheerful pains.
400,20,2691,Then said Ulysses to his son and swains:
400,20,2692,"“Go you to town, and for your dinner kill"
400,20,2693,The best swine ye can choose; myself will still
400,20,2694,"Stay with my father, and assay his eye"
400,20,2695,"If my acknowledg’d truth it can descry,"
400,20,2696,Or that my long time’s travel doth so change
400,20,2697,My sight to him that I appear as strange.”
400,20,2698,"Thus gave he arms to them, and home they hied."
400,20,2699,Ulysses to the fruitful field applied
400,20,2700,"His present place; nor found he Dolius there,"
400,20,2701,"His sons, or any servant, anywhere"
400,20,2702,In all that spacious ground; all gone from thence
400,20,2703,"Were dragging bushes to repair a fence,"
400,20,2704,Old Dolius leading all. Ulysses found
400,20,2705,"His father far above in that fair ground,"
400,20,2706,Employ’d in proining of a plant; his weeds
400,20,2707,"All torn and tatter’d, fit for homely deeds,"
400,20,2708,But not for him. Upon his legs he wore
400,20,2709,Patch’d boots to guard him from the bramble’s gore;
400,20,2710,His hands had thorn - proof hedging mittens on;
400,20,2711,His head a goat - skin casque; through all which shone
400,20,2712,His heart giv’n over to abjectest moan.
400,20,2713,"Him when Ulysses saw consum’d with age,"
400,20,2714,And all the ensigns on him that the rage
400,20,2715,"Of grief presented, he brake out in tears;"
400,20,2716,"And, taking stand then where a tree of pears"
400,20,2717,"Shot high his forehead over him, his mind"
400,20,2718,"Had much contention, if to yield to kind,"
400,20,2719,"Make straight way to his father, kiss, embrace,"
400,20,2720,"Tell his return, and put on all the face"
400,20,2721,And fashion of his instant - told return;
400,20,2722,"Or stay th’ impulsion, and the long day burn"
400,20,2723,Of his quite loss giv’n in his father’s fear
400,20,2724,"A little longer, trying first his cheer"
400,20,2725,"With some free dalliance, th’ earnest being so near."
400,20,2726,"This course his choice preferr’d, and forth he went."
400,20,2727,His father then his aged shoulders bent
400,20,2728,"Beneath what years had stoop’d, about a tree"
400,20,2729,"Busily digging: “O, old man,” said he,"
400,20,2730,"“You want no skill to dress and deck your ground,"
400,20,2731,For all your plants doth order’d distance bound.
400,20,2732,"No apple, pear, or olive, fig; or vine,"
400,20,2733,Nor any plat or quarter you confine
400,20,2734,"To grass or flow’rs stands empty of your care,"
400,20,2735,Which shows exact in each peculiar;
400,20,2736,And yet (which let not move you) you bestow
400,20,2737,"No care upon yourself, though to this show"
400,20,2738,Of outward irksomeness to what you are
400,20,2739,"You labour with an inward froward care,"
400,20,2740,"Which is your age, that should wear all without"
400,20,2741,More neat and cherishing. I make no doubt
400,20,2742,That any sloth you use procures your lord
400,20,2743,To let an old man go so much abhorr’d
400,20,2744,In all his weeds; nor shines there in your look
400,20,2745,A fashion and a goodliness so took
400,20,2746,With abject qualities to merit this
400,20,2747,Nasty entreaty. Your resemblance is
400,20,2748,"A very king’s, and shines through this retreat."
400,20,2749,You look like one that having wash’d and eat
400,20,2750,"Should sleep securely, lying sweet and neat."
400,20,2751,"_It is the ground of age, when cares abuse it,"
400,20,2752,"To know life’s end, and, as ’tis sweet, so use it._"
400,20,2753,"“But utter truth, and tell what lord is he"
400,20,2754,That rates your labour and your liberty?
400,20,2755,Whose orchard is it that you husband thus?
400,20,2756,"Or quit me this doubt, for if Ithacus"
400,20,2757,"This kingdom claims for his, the man I found"
400,20,2758,At first arrival here is hardly sound
400,20,2759,"Of brain or civil, not enduring stay"
400,20,2760,To tell nor hear me my inquiry out
400,20,2761,"Of that my friend, if still he bore about"
400,20,2762,"His life and being, or were div’d to death,"
400,20,2763,And in the house of him that harboureth
400,20,2764,The souls of men. For once he liv’d my guest;
400,20,2765,My land and house retaining interest
400,20,2766,In his abode there; where there sojourn’d none
400,20,2767,As guest from any foreign region
400,20,2768,Of more price with me. He deriv’d his race
400,20,2769,"From Ithaca, and said his father was"
400,20,2770,"Laertes, surnam’d Arcesiades,"
400,20,2771,"I had him home, and all the offices"
400,20,2772,"Perform’d to him that fitted any friend,"
400,20,2773,Whose proof I did to wealthy gifts extend:
400,20,2774,"Seven talents gold; a bowl all - silver, set"
400,20,2775,With pots of flowers; twelve robes that had no pleat!
400,20,2776,"Twelve cloaks, or mantles, of delicious dye;"
400,20,2777,Twelve inner weeds; twelve suits of tapestry.
400,20,2778,I gave him likewise women skill’d in use
400,20,2779,"Of loom and needle, freeing him to choose"
400,20,2780,"Four the most fair.” His father, weeping, said:"
400,20,2781,“Stranger! The earth to which you are convey’d
400,20,2782,"Is Ithaca; by such rude men possess’d,"
400,20,2783,"Unjust and insolent, as first address’d"
400,20,2784,To your encounter; but the gifts you gave
400,20,2785,"Were giv’n, alas! to the ungrateful grave."
400,20,2786,"If with his people, where you now arrive,"
400,20,2787,"Your fate had been to find your friend alive,"
400,20,2788,"You should have found like guest - rites from his hand,"
400,20,2789,"Like gifts, and kind pass to your wishéd land."
400,20,2790,But how long since receiv’d you for your guest
400,20,2791,"Your friend, my son, who was th’ unhappiest"
400,20,2792,"Of all men breathing, if he were at all?"
400,20,2793,O born when Fates and ill - aspects let fall
400,20,2794,A cruel influence for him! Far away
400,20,2795,From friends and country destin’d to allay.
400,20,2796,"The sea - bred appetites, or, left ashore,"
400,20,2797,"To be by fowls and upland monsters tore,"
400,20,2798,His life’s kind authors nor his wealthy wife
400,20,2799,"Bemoaning, as behov’d, his parted life,"
400,20,2800,"Nor closing, as in honour’s course it lies"
400,20,2801,"To all men dead, in bed his dying eyes."
400,20,2802,But give me knowledge of your name and race.
400,20,2803,What city bred you? Where the anchoring - place
400,20,2804,Your ship now rides - at lies that shor’d you here
400,20,2805,"And where your men? Or, if a passenger"
400,20,2806,"In other keels you came, who (giving land"
400,20,2807,"To your adventures here, some other strand"
400,20,2808,To fetch in further course) have left to us
400,20,2809,Your welcome presence?” His reply was thus:
400,20,2810,"“I am of Alybandé, where I hold"
400,20,2811,"My name’s chief house, to much renown extoll’d."
400,20,2812,"My father Aphidantes, fam’d to spring"
400,20,2813,"From Polypemon, the Molossian king."
400,20,2814,My name Eperitus. My taking land
400,20,2815,On this fair Isle was rul’d by the command
400,20,2816,"Of God or fortune, quite against consent"
400,20,2817,"Of my free purpose, that in course was bent"
400,20,2818,For th’ isle Sicania. My ship is held
400,20,2819,"Far from the city, near an ample field."
400,20,2820,"And for Ulysses, since his pass from me"
400,20,2821,"’Tis now five years. Unbless’d by destiny,"
400,20,2822,That all this time hath had the fate to err!
400,20,2823,"Though, at his parting, good birds did augur"
400,20,2824,"His putting - off, and on his right hand flew,"
400,20,2825,"Which to his passage my affection drew,"
400,20,2826,His spirit joyful; and my hope was now
400,20,2827,"To guest with him, and see his hand bestow"
400,20,2828,Rites of our friendship.” This a cloud of grief
400,20,2829,Cast over all the forces of his life.
400,20,2830,With both his hands the burning dust he swept
400,20,2831,"Up from the earth, which on his head he heapt,"
400,20,2832,And fetch’d a sigh as in it life were broke.
400,20,2833,"Which grieved his son, and gave so smart a stroke"
400,20,2834,"Upon his nostrils with the inward stripe,"
400,20,2835,That up the vein rose there; and weeping ripe
400,20,2836,He was to see his sire feel such woe
400,20,2837,"For his dissembled joy; which now let go,"
400,20,2838,"He sprung from earth, embrac’d and kiss’d his sire,"
400,20,2839,And said: “O father! He of whom y’ enquire
400,20,2840,"Am I myself, that, from you twenty years,"
400,20,2841,"Is now return’d. But do not break in tears,"
400,20,2842,"For now we must not forms of kind maintain,"
400,20,2843,But haste and guard the substance. I have slain
400,20,2844,"All my wife’s Wooers, so revenging now"
400,20,2845,Their wrong so long time suffer’d. Take not you
400,20,2846,The comfort of my coming then to heart
400,20,2847,"At this glad instant, but, in prov’d desert"
400,20,2848,"Of your grave judgment, give moan glad suspense,"
400,20,2849,And on the sudden put this consequence
400,20,2850,"In act as absolute, as all time went"
400,20,2851,To ripening of your resolute assent.”
400,20,2852,All this haste made not his staid faith so free
400,20,2853,"To trust his words; who said: “If you are he,"
400,20,2854,"Approve it by some sign.” “This scar then see,”"
400,20,2855,"Replied Ulysses, “giv’n me by the boar"
400,20,2856,"Slain in Parnassus, I being sent before"
400,20,2857,"By your’s and by my honour’d mother’s will,"
400,20,2858,To see your sire Autolycus fulfill
400,20,2859,The gifts he vow’d at giving of my name.
400,20,2860,"I’ll tell you, too, the trees, in goodly frame"
400,20,2861,"Of this fair orchard, that I ask’d of you"
400,20,2862,"Being yet a child, and follow’d for your show"
400,20,2863,And name of ev’ry tree. You gave me then
400,20,2864,"Of fig - trees forty, apple - bearers ten,"
400,20,2865,"Pear - trees thirteen, and fifty ranks of vine;"
400,20,2866,Each one of which a season did confine
400,20,2867,For his best eating. Not a grape did grow
400,20,2868,"That grew not there, and had his heavy brow"
400,20,2869,"When Jove’s fair daughters, the all ripening Hours,"
400,20,2870,Gave timely date to it.” This charg’d the pow’rs
400,20,2871,Both of his knees and heart with such impression
400,20,2872,"Of sudden comfort, that it gave possession"
400,20,2873,"Of all to Trance, the signs were all so true,"
400,20,2874,And did the love that gave them so renew.
400,20,2875,"He cast his arms about his son and sunk,"
400,20,2876,The circle slipping to his feet; so shrunk
400,20,2877,Were all his age’s forces with the fire
400,20,2878,Of his young love rekindled. The old sire
400,20,2879,The son took up quite lifeless. But his breath
400,20,2880,"Again respiring, and his soul from death"
400,20,2881,"His body’s pow’r recov’ring, out he cried,"
400,20,2882,And said: “O Jupiter! I now have tried
400,20,2883,That still there live in heav’n rememb’ring Gods
400,20,2884,Of men that serve them; though the periods
400,20,2885,They set on their appearances are long
400,20,2886,"In best men’s suff’rings, yet as sure as strong"
400,20,2887,"They are in comforts, be their strange delays"
400,20,2888,Extended never so from days to days.
400,20,2889,Yet see the short joys or the soon - mix’d fears
400,20,2890,Of helps withheld by them so many years!
400,20,2891,For if the Wooers now have paid the pain
400,20,2892,"Due to their impious pleasures, now again"
400,20,2893,"Extreme fear takes me, lest we straight shall see"
400,20,2894,"The Ithacensians here in mutiny,"
400,20,2895,Their messengers dispatch’d to win to friend
400,20,2896,The Cephallenian cities.” “Do not spend
400,20,2897,"Your thoughts on these cares,” said his suff’ring son,"
400,20,2898,"“But be of comfort, and see that course run"
400,20,2899,"That best may shun the worst. Our house is near,"
400,20,2900,Telemachus and both his herdsmen there
400,20,2901,To dress our supper with their utmost haste;
400,20,2902,"And thither haste we.” This said, forth they past,"
400,20,2903,"Came home, and found Telemachus at feast"
400,20,2904,"With both his swains; while who had done, all drest"
400,20,2905,With baths and balms and royally array’d
400,20,2906,The old king was by his Sicilian maid.
400,20,2907,"By whose side Pallas stood, his crook’d - age straight’ning,"
400,20,2908,"His flesh more plumping, and his looks enlight’ning."
400,20,2909,"Who issuing then to view, his son admir’d"
400,20,2910,"The Gods’ aspects into his form inspir’d,"
400,20,2911,"And said: “O father, certainly some God"
400,20,2912,"By your addression in this state hath stood,"
400,20,2913,"More great, more rev’rend, rend’ring you by far"
400,20,2914,At all your parts than of yourself you are!”
400,20,2915,"“I would to Jove,” said he, “the Sun, and She"
400,20,2916,"That bears Jove’s shield, the state had stood with me"
400,20,2917,That help’d me take - in the well - builded tow’rs
400,20,2918,Of strong Nericus (the Cephalian pow’rs
400,20,2919,"To that fair city leading) two days past,"
400,20,2920,"While with the Wooers thy conflict did last,"
400,20,2921,And I had then been in the Wooers’ wreak!
400,20,2922,I should have help’d thee so to render weak
400,20,2923,"Their stubborn knees, that in thy joy’s desert"
400,20,2924,Thy breast had been too little for thy heart.”
400,20,2925,"This said, and supper order’d by their men,"
400,20,2926,"They sat to it; old Dolius ent’ring then,"
400,20,2927,"And with him, tried with labour, his sons came,"
400,20,2928,"Call’d by their mother, the Sicilian dame"
400,20,2929,"That brought them up and dress’d their father’s fare,"
400,20,2930,"As whose age grew, with it increas’d her care"
400,20,2931,To see him serv’d as fitted. When thus set
400,20,2932,"These men beheld Ulysses there at meat,"
400,20,2933,"They knew him, and astonish’d in the place"
400,20,2934,"Stood at his presence; who, with words of grace,"
400,20,2935,"Call’d to old Dolius, saying: “Come and eat,"
400,20,2936,And banish all astonishment. Your meat
400,20,2937,"Hath long been ready, and ourselves made stay,"
400,20,2938,Expecting ever when your wishéd way
400,20,2939,Would reach amongst us.” This brought fiercely on
400,20,2940,"Old Dolius from his stand; who ran upon,"
400,20,2941,"With both his arms abroad, the King, and kiss’d"
400,20,2942,"Of both his rapt up hands the either wrist,"
400,20,2943,"Thus welcoming his presence: “O my love,"
400,20,2944,"Your presence here, for which all wishes strove,"
400,20,2945,No one expected. Ev’n the Gods have gone
400,20,2946,In guide before you to your mansión.
400,20,2947,"Welcome, and all joys to your heart contend."
400,20,2948,Knows yet Penelope? Or shall we send
400,20,2949,"Some one to tell her this?” “She knows,” said he,"
400,20,2950,"“What need these troubles, father, touch at thee?”"
400,20,2951,"Then came the sons of Dolius, and again"
400,20,2952,"Went over with their father’s entertain,"
400,20,2953,"Welcom’d, shook hands, and then to feast sat down."
400,20,2954,"About which while they sat, about the town"
400,20,2955,"Fame flew, and shriek’d about the cruel death"
400,20,2956,And fate the Wooers had sustain’d beneath
400,20,2957,Ulysses’ roofs. All heard; together all
400,20,2958,"From hence and thence met in Ulysses’ hall,"
400,20,2959,"Short - breath’d and noiseful, bore out all the dead"
400,20,2960,"To instant burial, while their deaths were spread"
400,20,2961,"To other neighbour cities where they liv’d,"
400,20,2962,From whence in swiftest fisher - boats arriv’d
400,20,2963,Men to transfer them home. In mean space here
400,20,2964,The heavy nobles all in council were;
400,20,2965,"Where, met in much heap, up to all arose"
400,20,2966,Extremely - griev’d Eupitheus so to lose
400,20,2967,"His son Antinous, who, first of all,"
400,20,2968,By great Ulysses’ hand had slaught’rous fall.
400,20,2969,"Whose father, weeping for him, said: “O friends,"
400,20,2970,"This man hath author’d works of dismal ends,"
400,20,2971,Long since conveying in his guide to Troy
400,20,2972,"Good men, and many that did ships employ,"
400,20,2973,"All which are lost, and all their soldiers dead;"
400,20,2974,And now the best men Cephallenia bred
400,20,2975,His hand hath slaughter’d. Go we then (before
400,20,2976,"His ’scape to Pylos, or the Elians’ shore,"
400,20,2977,Where rule the Epeans) ’gainst his horrid hand;
400,20,2978,"For we shall grieve, and infamy will brand"
400,20,2979,"Our fames for ever, if we see our sons"
400,20,2980,"And brothers end in these confusions,"
400,20,2981,Revenge left uninflicted. Nor will I
400,20,2982,"Enjoy one day’s life more, but grieve and die"
400,20,2983,With instant onset. Nor should you survive
400,20,2984,To keep a base and beastly name alive.
400,20,2985,"Haste, then, lest flight prevent us.” This with tears"
400,20,2986,"His griefs advis’d, and made all sufferers"
400,20,2987,In his affliction. But by this was come
400,20,2988,Up to the council from Ulysses’ home —
400,20,2989,"When sleep had left them, which the slaughters there"
400,20,2990,And their self - dangers from their eyes in fear
400,20,2991,Had two nights intercepted — those two men
400,20,2992,"That just Ulysses sav’d out of the slain,"
400,20,2993,Which Medon and the sacred singer were.
400,20,2994,These stood amidst the council; and the fear
400,20,2995,The slaughter had impress’d in either’s look
400,20,2996,"Stuck still so ghastly, that amaze it strook"
400,20,2997,Through ev’ry there beholder. To whose ears
400,20,2998,"One thus enforc’d, in his fright, cause of theirs:"
400,20,2999,"“Attend me, Ithacensians! This stern fact"
400,20,3000,Done by Ulysses was not put in act
400,20,3001,Without the Gods’ assistance. These self eyes
400,20,3002,Saw one of the immortal Deities
400,20,3003,"Close by Ulysses, Mentor’s form put on"
400,20,3004,At ev’ry part. And this sure Deity shone
400,20,3005,"Now near Ulysses, setting on his bold"
400,20,3006,"And slaught’rous spirit, now the points controll’d"
400,20,3007,"Of all the Wooers’ weapons, round about"
400,20,3008,"The arm’d house whisking, in continual rout"
400,20,3009,"Their party putting, till in heaps they fell.”"
400,20,3010,"This news new fears did through their spirits impell,"
400,20,3011,"When Halitherses (honour’d Mastor’s son,"
400,20,3012,Who of them all saw only what was done
400,20,3013,Present and future) the much - knowing man
400,20,3014,And aged heroë this plain course ran
400,20,3015,"Amongst their counsels: “Give me likewise ear,"
400,20,3016,"And let me tell ye, friends, that these ills bear"
400,20,3017,"On your malignant spleens their sad effects,"
400,20,3018,"Who not what I persuaded gave respects,"
400,20,3019,"Nor what the people’s pastor, Mentor, said, —"
400,20,3020,That you should see your issues’ follies stay’d
400,20,3021,"In those foul courses, by their petulant life"
400,20,3022,"The goods devouring, scandalling the wife"
400,20,3023,"Of no mean person, who, they still would say,"
400,20,3024,Could never more see his returning - day.
400,20,3025,"Which yet appearing now, now give it trust,"
400,20,3026,And yield to my free counsels: Do not thrust
400,20,3027,Your own safe persons on the acts your sons
400,20,3028,"So dearly bought, lest their confusions"
400,20,3029,On your lov’d heads your like addictions draw.”
400,20,3030,This stood so far from force of any law
400,20,3031,"To curb their loose attempts, that much the more"
400,20,3032,"They rush’d to wreak, and made rude tumult roar."
400,20,3033,The greater part of all the court arose;
400,20,3034,Good counsel could not ill designs dispose.
400,20,3035,"Eupitheus was persuader of the course,"
400,20,3036,"Which, cómplete - arm’d, they put in present force;"
400,20,3037,The rest sat still in council. These men met
400,20,3038,"Before the broad town, in a place they set"
400,20,3039,All girt in arms; Eupitheus choosing chief
400,20,3040,"To all their follies, who put grief to grief,"
400,20,3041,And in his slaughter’d son’s revenge did burn.
400,20,3042,"But Fate gave never feet to his return,"
400,20,3043,Ordaining there his death. Then Pallas spake
400,20,3044,"To Jove, her Father, with intent to make"
400,20,3045,"His will high arbiter of th’ act design’d,"
400,20,3046,And ask’d of him what his unsearchéd mind
400,20,3047,"Held undiscover’d? If with arms, and ill,"
400,20,3048,"And grave encounter he, would first fulfill"
400,20,3049,"His sacred purpose, or both parts combine"
400,20,3050,In peaceful friendship? He ask’d: “Why incline
400,20,3051,These doubts thy counsels? Hast not thou decreed
400,20,3052,That Ithacus should come and give his deed
400,20,3053,The glory of revenge on these and theirs?
400,20,3054,Perform thy will; the frame of these affairs
400,20,3055,Have this fit issue: When Ulysses’ hand
400,20,3056,"Hath reach’d full wreak, his then renown’d command"
400,20,3057,"Shall reign for ever, faithful truces strook"
400,20,3058,’Twixt him and all; for ev’ry man shall brook
400,20,3059,His sons’ and brothers’ slaughters; by our mean
400,20,3060,"To send Oblivion in, expunging clean"
400,20,3061,"The character of enmity in them all,"
400,20,3062,"As in best leagues before. _Peace, festival,"
400,20,3063,"And riches in abundance, be the state"
400,20,3064,That crowns the close of wise Ulysses’ Fate.”_
400,20,3065,"This spurr’d the free, who from heav’n’s continent"
400,20,3066,To th’ Ithacensian isle made straight descent.
400,20,3067,"Where, dinner past, Ulysses said: “Some one"
400,20,3068,Look out to see their nearness.” Dolius’ son
400,20,3069,"Made present speed abroad, and saw them nigh,"
400,20,3070,"Ran back, and told, bade arm; and instantly"
400,20,3071,"Were all in arms. Ulysses’ part was four,"
400,20,3072,And six more sons of Dolius; all his pow’r
400,20,3073,"Two only more, which were his aged sire"
400,20,3074,"And like - year’d Dolius, whose lives’ - slak’d fire"
400,20,3075,"All - white had left their heads, yet, driv’n by need,"
400,20,3076,Made soldiers both of necessary deed.
400,20,3077,"And now, all - girt in arms, the ports set wide,"
400,20,3078,"They sallied forth, Ulysses being their guide;"
400,20,3079,"And to them in the instant Pallas came,"
400,20,3080,"In form and voice like Mentor, who a flame"
400,20,3081,Inspir’d of comfort in Ulysses’ heart
400,20,3082,"With her seen presence. To his son, apart,"
400,20,3083,"He thus then spake: “Now, son, your eyes shall see,"
400,20,3084,"Expos’d in slaught’rous fight, the enemy,"
400,20,3085,Against whom who shall best serve will be seen.
400,20,3086,"Disgrace not then your race, that yet hath been"
400,20,3087,For force and fortitude the foremost tried
400,20,3088,Of all earth’s offsprings.” His true son replied:
400,20,3089,"“Yourself shall see, lov’d father, if you please,"
400,20,3090,That my deservings shall in nought digress
400,20,3091,From best fame of our race’s foremost merit.”
400,20,3092,"The old king sprung for joy to hear his spirit,"
400,20,3093,"And said: “O lov’d Immortals, what a day"
400,20,3094,Do your clear bounties to my life display!
400,20,3095,"I joy, past measure, to behold my son"
400,20,3096,And nephew close in such contention
400,20,3097,"Of virtues martial.” Pallas, standing near,"
400,20,3098,"Said: “O my friend! Of all supremely dear,"
400,20,3099,"Seed of Arcesius, pray to Jove and Her"
400,20,3100,"That rules in arms, his daughter, and a dart,"
400,20,3101,"Spritefully brandish’d, hurl at th’ adverse part.”"
400,20,3102,"This said, he pray’d; and she a mighty force"
400,20,3103,"Inspir’d within him, who gave instant course"
400,20,3104,"To his brave - brandish’d lance, which struck the brass"
400,20,3105,"That cheek’d Eupitheus’ casque, and thrust his pass"
400,20,3106,"Quite through his head; who fell, and sounded falling,"
400,20,3107,His arms the sound again from earth recalling.
400,20,3108,"Ulysses and his son rush’d on before,"
400,20,3109,And with their both - way - headed darts did gore
400,20,3110,"Their enemies’ breasts so thick, that all had gone"
400,20,3111,"The way of slaughter, had not Pallas thrown"
400,20,3112,"Her voice betwixt them, charging all to stay"
400,20,3113,And spare expense of blood. Her voice did fray
400,20,3114,The blood so from their faces that it left
400,20,3115,A greenish paleness; all their hands it reft
400,20,3116,"Of all their weapons, falling thence to earth;"
400,20,3117,"And to the common mother of their birth,"
400,20,3118,"The city, all fled, in desire to save"
400,20,3119,The lives yet left them. Then Ulysses gave
400,20,3120,"A horrid shout, and like Jove’s eagle flew"
400,20,3121,"In fiery pursuit, till Saturnius threw"
400,20,3122,"His smoking lightning ’twixt them, that had fall"
400,20,3123,"Before Minerva, who then out did call"
400,20,3124,Thus to Ulysses: “Born of Jove! Abstain
400,20,3125,From further bloodshed. Jove’s hand in the slain
400,20,3126,Hath equall’d in their pains their prides to thee.
400,20,3127,"Abstain, then, lest you move the Deity.”"
400,20,3128,"Again then, ’twixt both parts the Seed of Jove,"
400,20,3129,"Athenian Pallas, of all future love"
400,20,3130,"A league compos’d, and for her form took choice"
400,20,3131,Of Mentor’s likeness both in limb and voice.
